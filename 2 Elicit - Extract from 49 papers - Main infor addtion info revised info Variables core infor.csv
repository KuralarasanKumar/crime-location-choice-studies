- Economic variables are not explicitly mentioned, but retail floor space is discussed as a factor influencing target choice.
- Land use variables include the presence of schools and retail facilities, which are considered routine activity nodes.
- Infrastructure variables include the presence of underground stations, which affect accessibility.
- Distance/accessibility variables include the distance from the city center and the presence of the Thames River as a barrier.
- Crime opportunity variables include the number of offenses in the previous 24 hours, which is related to contagion.
- Social/behavioral variables are related to social disorganization, such as population churn rates and ethnic diversity.
- Other/control variables include population density and deprivation levels.","  - ""Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making.""
  - ""The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular.""
  - ""For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River.""
  - ""In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours.""
  - ""The estimates of population churn rates and ethnic heterogeneity were derived using data from the 2001 U.K. Census.""

```</table_quotation>""","- The study focuses on commercial robberies in the Netherlands, using data from the National Commercial Robbery Registration System (LORS), the Nationwide Citizen Information System (GBA), and a database of postal code areas.
- The study examines the role of residential history in crime location choices, specifically how former residential areas influence where offenders commit crimes.
- The study uses a conditional logit model to test hypotheses about the effects of residential history on crime location choices.
- The findings suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crimes in areas where they have lived for a long time and in areas they left recently.
- The study highlights the importance of residential experience in crime location choices, with areas of long former residence and recent past residence being more likely targets.
- The study notes limitations due to sample size and suggests future research should consider direct measurements of awareness space and offender accounts.
- The study provides practical implications for geographical offender profiling by suggesting that police should consider former residences in their investigations.","  - ""The third source of data is a database containing demographic, social and economic information on all postal code areas in the Netherlands.""
  - ""Eight different attributes of the 4006 postal code areas have been included as control variables in the analyses, quantifying the 'all other things being equal' condition in the hypotheses.""
  - ""One of the control variables is the total floor area of retail businesses, a straightforward measurement of the opportunity structure for commercial robbery.""
  - ""The distance to the nearest highway ramp was included as a measure of the accessibility of entry and escape routes.""
  - ""The mean value of residential property measures affluence in the area.""
  - ""The other variables -population density, population size and population percentages of 15-25-year-old, foreign-born and single residents -were included as proxy indicators of social disorganization.""
  - ""The independent variables include generic area characteristics such as population size and affluence, as well as offenderspecific characteristics, in particular the distance of the area from the offender's residence.""
  - ""the independent variables of major interest are whether, for how long and until what point the area has been part of the offender's residential history.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=11 table_on_page=1>```markdown

5. Population Information: Not explicitly mentioned.","  - ""The third source is a national database of demographic, social, and economic information on all (four-digit) postal code areas in the Netherlands.""
  - ""There are approximately 4,000 postal code areas nationwide, with an average population size of 4,900 and an average number of households of 2,100.""
  - ""In terms of their size, shape, and topography, the postal code area is a useful approximation of the area one would expect people to be familiar with if they lived within it.""
  - ""Throughout the remainder of this article, where ""area of residence"" is used to describe empirical findings, it means ""postal code area of residence.""""

  - ""When discrete choice models are applied to location choices, the alternatives that can be chosen are spatial entities.""
  - ""The first data source is a police information system used by the Greater The Hague Police Force that was designed to support crime investigations.""
  - ""The second source of data is the population registration data, which are held in a nationwide information system (Dutch acronym GBA) used by Dutch municipalities and several other agencies, to keep track of birth, death, nationality, marriage, divorce, childbirth, and residential addresses of all Dutch citizens.""
  - ""The availability of reliable records of previous addresses is a significant strength of the current study.""",,"- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the postal code area, as indicated by the use of this term throughout the paper to describe empirical findings.
- The calendar year(s) of data collection are 2004 and 2005, as mentioned in the context of selecting offenders for the study.
- The country or jurisdiction where the study was conducted is the Netherlands, as indicated by the use of Dutch databases and police records.
- The total area of the study site is implied to be the entire Netherlands, given the national scope of the data sources.
- The type of crime analyzed includes robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults, as specified in the paper.
- The type of discrete choice model used is the conditional logit model, as explicitly stated.
- The sampling approach for alternatives is not explicitly mentioned, but the use of a conditional logit model suggests a full choice set.
- Independent variables include residential history and distance measures, as detailed in the paper.
- The population per spatial unit is an average of 4,900 per postal code area.
- The choice of SUoA is justified by its suitability as an area familiar to residents and its design for local travel.
- Data sources include police records, population registration data, and a national demographic database.
- There is no mention of limitations or trade-offs in SUoA selection.","  - ""Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives.""
  - ""offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in.""

  - ""The dependent variable is defined as a dichotomous variable that equals 1 for the particular area that was actually chosen and equals 0 for all other areas.""
  - ""The independent variables of theoretical interest vary across both offenses and potential target areas. They include the following variables measured at the time of the offense (measurement level in parentheses):

1. Whether the offender lives in the area (dichotomous) 2. Whether the offender ever has lived in the area before (but not currently) (dichotomous)

3. Whether the offender has lived in the area longer or shorter than 2 years (dichotomous) 4. Whether the offender has moved out of the area shorter or longer than 2 years ago (dichotomous) 5. The distance between the area and the offender's current area of residence (continuous) 6. The shortest distance between the area and the nearest former area of residence (continuous)""
  - ""The first hypothesis to be tested in this study is coined the home hypothesis. It relates the residential history of an offender, including any past residences as well as the present residence, to his or her selection of a crime site.""
  - ""The next hypothesis is the history hypothesis, which suggests that a logical order of precedence exists among an area of current residence, of past residence, and of ""never"" residence.""
  - ""The duration hypothesis formalizes this assumption by asserting that offenders are more likely to commit an offense in an area where they lived during a longer period of time than in one where they lived a shorter period of time.""
  - ""The fifth hypothesis is the proximity hypothesis. It asserts that, in addition to being more likely to offend in areas where they live or lived, offenders also are more likely to offend nearby the current or former areas of residence.""
  - ""The confirmation of all hypotheses supports the framework of crime pattern theory, a theory that asserts that a crime takes place where a motivated offender's awareness space intersects with suitable targets.""",,"- The study focuses on the effects of residential history on crime location choice, specifically examining how offenders' current and former residential areas influence their crime locations.
- The study uses data from the Greater The Hague Police Force, population registration data, and a national database of demographic, social, and economic information.
- The study employs a discrete choice model to analyze location choices, with variables including whether the offender lives in the area, has lived there before, duration of residence, recency of move, distance to current residence, and distance to former residence.
- The study tests several hypotheses: the home hypothesis (current and former residence influence), history hypothesis (order of precedence among current, past, and never residence), recency hypothesis (recent moves influence), duration hypothesis (length of residence influences), and proximity hypothesis (offending near current or former residences).
- The findings support all hypotheses, indicating that offenders are more likely to commit crimes in areas where they live or have lived, with recency and duration of residence affecting these choices.
- The study uses postal code areas as the spatial unit of analysis, which is justified by their design for post delivery services and their relation to urbanization levels.","  - ""The first hypothesis to be tested in this study is coined the home hypothesis.

</table_quotation>""","- The paper discusses several hypotheses related to crime location choice, including the home hypothesis, history hypothesis, recency hypothesis, duration hypothesis, and proximity hypothesis. These hypotheses are used to understand how an offender's residential history influences their choice of crime location.
- The independent variables used in the study are listed in the paper and include whether the offender lives in the area, whether they have lived there before, duration of residence, recency of moving out, distance to current residence, and distance to former residence.
- The tables at the end of the paper provide additional details on the variables used in the study, including odds ratios and statistical significance for each hypothesis.
- The study uses a discrete choice model to analyze these variables and their impact on crime location choice.","  - ""The first hypothesis to be tested in this study is coined the home hypothesis. It relates the residential history of an offender, including any past residences as well as the present residence, to his or her selection of a crime site.""
  - ""The next hypothesis is the history hypothesis, which suggests that a logical order of precedence exists among an area of current residence, of past residence, and of ""never"" residence.""
  - ""Additional challenges for the theory are sought by formulating and examining three supplementary hypotheses that condition the role of current and former residential areas temporally and spatially.""
  - ""The independent variables of theoretical interest vary across both offenses and potential target areas. They include the following variables measured at the time of the offense (measurement level in parentheses):

1. Whether the offender lives in the area (dichotomous) 2. Whether the offender ever has lived in the area before (but not currently) (dichotomous)

3. Whether the offender has lived in the area longer or shorter than 2 years (dichotomous) 4. Whether the offender has moved out of the area shorter or longer than 2 years ago (dichotomous) 5. The distance between the area and the offender's current area of residence (continuous) 6. The shortest distance between the area and the nearest former area of residence (continuous)""
  - ""Four variables were used as control variables because they have been shown repeatedly to be related strongly to the volume of various types of crime in postal code areas (Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;Nieuwbeerta et al., 2008;Wilsem, Wittebrood, and de Graaf, 2006). These variables are population size, percentage of singleperson households, poverty level (measured by the average value of residential property in the area), and level of urbanization (a score assigned by Statistics Netherlands to capture address density).""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=21 table_on_page=1>```markdown

- The use of discrete spatial choice models is a key methodological approach in the study.
- The study area is defined by four-digit postal code areas in the greater The Hague area, with specific population and area sizes.
- Data sources include police information systems and population registration data, which are crucial for understanding the study's context.
- The study's findings highlight the increased risk of targeting residential areas of family members, particularly children.
- The lack of gender differences in the effects of familial residential areas on crime location choice is a significant finding.

```</table_quotation>""","- The paper discusses the influence of prior crime locations on subsequent crime location choices, which is the main focus of the study.
- The study tests five hypotheses related to the influence of prior crime locations, including the likelihood of reoffending in previously targeted areas, the effect of distance, recency, frequency, and type of crime.
- The results from the tables and text indicate that prior crime locations significantly influence subsequent choices, with stronger effects for recent, frequent, nearby, and same-type crimes.
- The tables provide specific data on the odds ratios for these variables, supporting the hypotheses.
- The study uses discrete choice models to analyze these effects, indicating a structured approach to understanding crime location choices.","  - ""The main hypothesis being tested is that offenders are more likely to commit crimes in areas where they offended before than in areas not previously targeted.""
  - ""The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.""
  - ""To test our hypotheses, multiple study variables were constructed based on these offenses.""
  - ""First, for each offense and the associated 142 alternative postal code areas, a dichotomous variable previously chosen (0 = no; 1 = yes) was constructed to indicate whether the offender had committed a prior offense in that particular postal code area in the previous 3 years (to test hypothesis 1).""
  - ""Second, to test the proximity hypothesis (hypothesis 2), a distance to prior offense variable (continuous) was created by calculating the Euclidian distance in kilometers from the former crime location(s) to each of the 142 alternative target areas.""
  - ""Third, for testing the recency hypothesis (hypothesis 3), six different dichotomous variables (previously chosen within . . . days) were created to indicate whether a postal code area was a previous crime location within 1) a maximum of 2 days, 2) 3-7 days, 3) 8-30 days, 4) 31-183 days (1-6 months), 5) 184-730 days (6 months to 2 years), and 6) 731-1,096 days (2-3 years) before the dependent variable offense.""
  - ""Fourth, for each alternative target area, the total number of prior offenses committed in that particular alternative was calculated (number of prior offenses).""
  - ""Fifth, two dichotomous variables were created to indicate whether the prior offense was of the same or different crime type as the dependent variable offense (same type and different type, to test hypothesis 5).""
  - ""Several variables were constructed following the findings and methods described by Bernasco (2010b) . Residential areas in which the offender lived at the time of the offense were indicated, divided into two separate variables to indicate areas in which the offender had lived for a shorter period (since <2 years) at the time of the offense or for a longer period (since >2 years).""
  - ""Specific target area characteristics were included as control variables in our study because they are described as indicators of crime attractors and crime generators (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1995) or of guardianship (Cohen and Felson, 1979), and several studies have found that they influenced crime rates in an area (Bernasco and Block, 2011;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;McCord et al., 2007;Nieuwbeerta et al., 2008;Reynald, 2011).""
  - ""For each postal code area in the Netherlands, census-like statistics (sociodemographic and socioeconomic information) are regularly recorded by Statistics Netherlands.""
  - ""The LISA database (in Dutch: Landelijk Informatiesysteem Arbeidsplaatsen; for more information, see Steenbeek et al., 2012), which contains information on businesses and other facilities where paid work is done, was used to obtain crime year-specific information about several area characteristics in each postal code area in the greater The Hague area.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=14 table_on_page=1>```

- Population density measures: Not explicitly mentioned","  - ""The data used in this study included solved residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offenses occurring between 2009 and 2018 from a national dataset obtained from the New Zealand Police.""
  - ""In this study we used the NZ Census Statistical Area 2 (SA2) as the set of locations from which an offense location could be chosen.""
  - ""SA2s roughly equate to neighborhoods and typically contain 2000-4000 residents in metropolitan areas (1000-5000 in rural areas).""
  - ""The outcome variable was the choice of SA2: in which of the 2153 SA2 areas of New Zealand did the offender commit the index offense?""

- The data collection spanned from 2009 to 2018, as mentioned in the context of the dataset used.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) was the SA2, which is described as roughly equivalent to neighborhoods and typically containing 2000-4000 residents.
- The total area of the study site is not explicitly mentioned in terms of km², but it is implied to be the entire country of New Zealand since the study uses national data.
- The types of crime analyzed included residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery, and extra-familial sex offenses.
- The type of discrete choice model used was the conditional logit model.
- The sampling approach for alternatives involved comparing different strategies, including importance sampling and simple random sampling.
- Independent variables included in the model were related to the proximity of offenders' routine activity nodes to each SA2 and the level of crime opportunity in each SA2.
- The population per spatial unit is mentioned as typically containing 2000-4000 residents.
- The choice of SA2 as the SUoA is justified by its equivalence to neighborhoods and its use in other crime location choice studies.
- Data sources used included police data and census data.
- Limitations mentioned include the potential for selection bias and the fact that not all activity nodes of all offenders were included in the data.","  - ""The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders' choices.""
  - ""Methods Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders' pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members' homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives.""

  - ""We assessed the quality of the sampling strategies with a range of criteria.""
  - ""Our results suggest that overall, importance sampling that ensures the inclusion of choice alternatives near to offenders' activity nodes can lead to coefficients and model fit on par with the results of the full model using all alternatives in each choice set, while reducing the computational burden considerably.""

  - ""the present results are confined to the use of conditional logit rather than other discrete choice models.""",,"- The study focuses on individual-level crime location choice research, using a large dataset to model complex relationships between crime locations and offender choices.
- The study uses police data from New Zealand, covering various crime types such as burglary, robbery, and sex offenses.
- The spatial unit of analysis is the NZ Census Statistical Area 2 (SA2), which is used to define the choice sets for offenders.
- The study tests different sampling strategies, including importance sampling, to reduce computational burden while maintaining model accuracy.
- The conditional logit model is used to estimate the probability of choosing a particular location for crime.
- The study assesses the quality of sampling strategies based on criteria such as dataset size and model fit.
- The findings suggest that importance sampling is effective in reducing computational burden while maintaining model accuracy.
- The study has limitations, such as potential selection bias and incomplete data on activity nodes.","  - ""The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders' activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime.""
  - ""We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling.""
  - ""The data used in this study included solved residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offenses occurring between 2009 and 2018 from a national dataset obtained from the New Zealand Police.""
  - ""For each of the offenders recorded as having committed these offenses, the location of their most recent offense was the location choice of interest.""
  - ""The dataset also included the locations of a range of pre-offense activity nodes.""
  - ""we used the NZ Census Statistical Area 2 (SA2) as the set of locations from which an offense location could be chosen.""
  - ""The outcome variable was the choice of SA2: in which of the 2153 SA2 areas of New Zealand did the offender commit the index offense?""
  - ""we constructed a simple model using six predictors reflecting the proximity of offenders' routine activity nodes to each SA2 in their choice set, and an additional seventh predictor reflecting the level of crime opportunity in each SA2.""
  - ""The six distance bands were: within the same SA2, or within 0-200 m, 200-500 m, 500 m-1 km, 1-2 km or 2-5 km outside of the SA2 boundary.""
  - ""The opportunity measures were sourced from Statistics NZ Census and Business Demography data""
  - ""For residential burglary, opportunity was the number of households in the SA2.""
  - ""For non-residential burglary it was the number of business units in any industry.""
  - ""For commercial robbery, it was the number of business units for industries of the types targeted in commercial robbery.""
  - ""For personal robbery and extra-familial sex offenses it was the number of commercial or public business units, as an indicator of ambient population and thus the number of potential crime targets.10""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=17 table_on_page=1>```markdown

REASONING:

1. The paper uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze crime location choices, focusing on whether co-offended crimes are more likely to occur in shared awareness spaces.
2. The dependent variable is the choice of a geographical area for committing a co-offended crime.
3. Independent variables include home location, previous home location, and previous crime location, which are scored based on whether they are part of an offender's awareness space.
4. Control variables include socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, as well as indicators of crime attractors and generators.
5. The LISA database provides information on businesses and facilities, which are used as control variables in the model.
6. The table on page 12 likely contains detailed results of the conditional logit model, including odds ratios for various independent and control variables.","  - ""The discrete spatial choice model testing whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in the shared awareness space of the co-offending group includes a number of control variables measuring area characteristics known to influence crime location choice.""

REASONING:

- The paper uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze crime location choices, which includes several independent variables.
- The independent variables related to awareness space include current home location, previous home location, and previous crime location.
- These variables are binary, indicating whether an area is part of an offender's awareness space.
- The study also uses control variables related to area characteristics, which are derived from socio-demographic and socio-economic data from Statistics Netherlands and business data from the LISA database.
- The control variables include indicators of crime attractors and generators, such as the number of retail stores, hotels, restaurants, bars, schools, cultural facilities, health care institutions, and sport and leisure facilities.
- The table on page 12 provides detailed results of the conditional logit model, which likely includes the odds ratios for these variables.","  - ""The dependent variable in this study is the choice of an area j from a geographical set of alternatives J to co-offend in.""
  - ""The discrete spatial choice model testing whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in the shared awareness space of the co-offending group includes a number of control variables measuring area characteristics known to influence crime location choice.""
  - ""These variables are indicators of crime attractors and crime generators (Brantingham and Brantingham 1995) and of guardianship (Cohen and Felson 1979).""
  - ""Statistics Netherlands records socio-demographic and socio-economic information for each postal code area in the Netherlands.""
  - ""The LISA database (see Steenbeek et al. 2012 for more information on the LISA database), a database containing information on businesses, was used to obtain year-postal code area-specific information on the number of retail stores, hotels, restaurants, bars, schools, cultural facilities, health care institutions and sport and leisure facilities.""
  - ""The data were not specifically sampled to study co-offending, which led to a large number of offenders and offences being removed from the sample.""
  - ""The final sample consisted of 4,654 offenders with at least one cooffended crime in a group of two or three offenders.""
  - ""The residential history of the offenders was derived from population registration data held in a nationwide information system (Dutch acronym is BRP).""
  - ""The offences were obtained from the police information system used by the greater The Hague Police Service.""",,"- The paper uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze crime location choices, with the dependent variable being the choice of an area to co-offend in.
- Independent variables are categorized into several types, including demographic, economic, land use, and crime opportunity variables.
- Demographic variables include population density and household size, while economic variables are not explicitly mentioned but could be inferred from socio-economic data.
- Land use variables are derived from the LISA database, which includes information on retail stores, hotels, restaurants, and other facilities.
- Crime opportunity variables include previous crime locations and guardianship indicators.
- The study area is the greater The Hague region, consisting of 142 postal code areas, each averaging 2.96 km².
- Data sources for variables include Statistics Netherlands for socio-demographic data, the LISA database for land use data, and police records for crime data.
- The sampling strategy involved selecting offenders with at least one co-offended crime, leading to a final sample of 4,654 offenders.
- Population information is provided as an average population size of 7,000 per postal code area.
- The study acknowledges limitations related to the spatial unit choice and the potential for over-representation of co-offending due to the use of police arrest data."

KEY FINDINGS

Main Results: There are significant spatial differences in crime location choices between migrant and native robbers. Migrant robbers prefer labor-intensive industrial clusters, while native robbers prefer old urban areas and urban villages. 
Significant Predictors: Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations significantly influence migrant robbers' crime location choices but not native robbers'. 
Model Performance: Pseudo R² for both models is greater than 0.25, indicating strong explanatory power. 
Scale Effects: Not mentioned

- The study was conducted in the Netherlands, with the entire country as the study area, and used neighbourhoods as the spatial unit of analysis.
- The study involved 78 offenders who reported on their activity spaces and committed offences, with a total of 140 offences analyzed.
- The study used conditional logit models to test hypotheses about crime location choice.
- The study included various independent variables such as activity node types (residential, school/work, leisure), visiting frequency, and control variables like residential population density and employee density.
- The study found that offending is more likely in activity spaces and that visiting frequency increases this likelihood.
- The study used a pseudo-R² to measure model performance, indicating a good fit of the model to the data.","  - ""The activity nodes were coded into several independent dummy variables, using their location geocoded to one of the 12,821 neighbourhoods and the information about the start and end of the period during which they were regularly visited.""

  - ""The first applies to temporal variations.""
  - ""Many studies have demonstrated that crime frequencies vary by time of day, by day of week and by season""
  - ""With respect to snatching offenses, a plausible hypothesis could be that the availability of targets will vary both over space and time,""
  - ""Although location choice studies have been conducted with spatial units of varying levels of granularity, ranging from neighborhoods down to individual addresses, what seems to be lacking in the literature is a systematic analysis of the extent to which the findings of location choice studies depend on the shapes, sizes and nesting structures of the spatial units of analysis.""
  - ""Location preferences of offenders are influenced by their awareness space""
  - ""Future research could focus on effects of offenders' work place, previous residences and other anchor points that are part of their awareness space and have a possible impact on their offending location choices.""
  - ""A few studies have confirmed the possible effect of co-offending on location choice""

- Economic variables are not explicitly mentioned but could be inferred from the context of crime location choices.
- Land use variables include transportation hubs, subway stations, bus stations, bars and clubs, Cybercafés, malls and supermarkets, high schools, and surveillance cameras.
- Infrastructure variables are related to the physical environment such as transportation hubs and surveillance cameras.
- Distance/accessibility variables include the distance of journey to prior robbery and distance of journey to subsequent robbery.
- Crime opportunity variables are related to the presence of potential targets and the ease of committing crimes.
- Social/behavioral variables include the repeat offender status and the impact of prior arrests on subsequent crime location choices.

- The SA2s have a median land area of 1.2 km², with sizes ranging between 0.84 and 2.2 km².
- The study was conducted in New Zealand, using data from the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA).
- The crimes analyzed include residential burglaries, non-residential burglaries, commercial robberies, personal robberies, and extra-familial sex offenses.
- The type of discrete choice model used is the conditional logit model.
- The sampling approach for alternatives involved stratified importance sampling, including the chosen SA2, all SA2s with any activity nodes within 5 km of the SA2 boundary, and 10 SA2s randomly selected from the remaining SA2s.
- Independent variables included in the model are reliability and relevance factors, such as frequency, recency, duration, behavior similarity, location similarity, hour similarity, day similarity, and season similarity. These were derived from police records.
- The population per spatial unit is mentioned as 2,000-4,000 residents for urban areas and 1,000-3,000 for rural areas.
- The choice of SUoA is justified as balancing the risk of ignoring spatial spill-over mechanisms and spatial heterogeneity.
- Data sources used include police incident reports and administrative data.
- Limitations or trade-offs in SUoA selection are not explicitly mentioned, but the study discusses challenges in employing the methodological paradigm with police administrative data.
- Main findings related to SUoA size or model performance include the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.","  - ""This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders' knowledge of locations in their crime location choices.""
  - ""Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders' pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members' home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand.""
  - ""Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge-where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities-and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities.""

  - ""We included the attributes of surrounding areas within a series of distance bands around each SA2 alternative (elaborated below) to further reduce the risk of ignoring spatial spill-over, by explicitly accounting for activity locations in nearby units.""
  - ""The outcome variable reflects each offender's choice of crime location: in which of the 2,153 SA2s the reference offense was committed.""
  - ""First, reliability and relevance variables (e.g., recency, behavior similarity) were calculated for each prior activity node, as summarized in Table 1 and further detailed in Supplemental Material S1.""

  - ""For each crime type (i.e., each model), we included a single variable indicative of the target or victim distribution for that crime type.""
  - ""we employed conditional logit models (McFadden, 1984).""
  - ""The mechanics of the conditional logit model are described in detail elsewhere (Bernasco, 2010b), but to summarize, the model estimates the expected utility of each choice alternative (SA2), given the attributes of that alternative, and selects the alternative that maximizes utility.""

- The study uses Census data from 2000 and 2010 for demographic and economic variables.
- The independent variables include demographic (e.g., percentage of residents below poverty, percentage of single-parent households), economic (e.g., median income, Gini coefficient), and social variables (e.g., racial/ethnic heterogeneity, residential stability).
- The study uses block groups as the spatial unit, which are the smallest units available for meaningful sociodemographic data.
- The sampling strategy involves using data from all arrests for burglaries over a 13-year period, totaling 7,124 incidents and 9,288 unique suspects.
- The study excludes incidents with unknown or incorrect addresses and those where the suspect lives outside the city boundaries."

- The study uses a unique combination of data sources, including police arrest records, mobile phone mobility data, and street view images.
- The spatial unit of analysis is communities (juweihui or cunweihui) in the city of ZG, with an average size of 0.958km² and an average population of 5,957.
- The study uses discrete choice models to estimate the impact of various factors on burglars' location choices.
- The study period for data collection was 2017 and 2018 for burglary cases and October 2019 for mobile phone mobility data.
- The study includes a range of variables such as physical disorder, spatial knowledge, and socio-economic characteristics.
- The findings highlight the importance of neighborhood context and spatial knowledge in burglars' decision-making processes.","  - ""We measure observed and perceived physical disorder from 107,858 street view images using computer vision algorithms.""
  - ""Geo-referenced mobile phone flows between 1,642 census units are used to approximate offenders' potential spatial knowledge about target neighborhoods.""
  - ""Discrete choice models are estimated separately for burglars from disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods (N=1,972).""
  - ""The present study explicitly considers the impact of meso-level social context on burglars' choice of target neighborhoods.""
  - ""We ask whether burglars' assessment of physical disorder in making burglary location choice differs by the level of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage.""
  - ""We draw on a range of unique data sources, including police arrest records, mobile phone mobility big data, and massive street view images.""
  - ""We model burglars' target location choice using a conditional logit specification where a burglar's decision of where to offend depends on an array of factors involving the characteristics of both the residential and potential target neighborhoods.""

  - ""The present study focuses on the city of ZG in southeast China.""
  - ""We use communities (juweihui or cunweihui) as the unit of analysis.""
  - ""We construct neighborhood concentrated disadvantage based on the following seven neighborhood conditions: unemployment rate, low educational attainment (high school or lower), share of non-locals, overcrowding, share of renters, average rent price, and access to tap water, bath, and kitchen.""
  - ""We obtain point of interest data of 2016 in the city of ZG to account for common crime generators and attractors noted in the literature for burglary""
  - ""Community-level socio-demographic characteristics come from the 2010 sixth national census of China.""
  - ""To measure physical disorder on the street, we use street view images from Baidu Map""

- The study area size is approximately 2.813km² for each community, with an average size of 0.958km² after excluding communities without street view images.
- The data sources include police arrest data, mobile phone mobility data, street view images, POI data, and census data.
- The sampling strategy involves using communities as the unit of analysis, with a total of 1,652 spatially contiguous communities in the analytical sample.
- The independent variables include demographic variables (population density), economic variables (unemployment rate, average rent price), land use variables (residential density, commercial areas), infrastructure variables (roads, transit), distance variables (distance from burglar's home), crime opportunity variables (previous crimes, guardianship), and social variables (social cohesion, disorder).
- The study uses a conditional logit model to predict burglary location choice based on these variables."

3. Data Sources for Variables
Primary sources for independent variables: Police records (New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application)

4. Sampling Strategy Details
Stratified importance sampling approach used to manage computational challenges; choice set includes chosen SA2 and alternatives within 5 km.

5. Population Information
Population per spatial unit: SA2s typically contain 2000-4000 residents in urban areas and 1000-3000 residents in rural areas.","  - ""The median land area of the sampled SA2s was 1.2km 2 (quartiles 0.84, 2.2 km 2 ) on average across the five offences modelled.""
  - ""The question that the discrete spatial choice model sets out to answer is as follows: which attributes of locations make offenders decide to choose them (or avoid them) for committing crime?""
  - ""The models provided a good fit to the data with pseudo R 2 values between 0.35 and 0.42 (McFadden 1973), which are at the upper end of the range of values found in other DSCM studies""
  - ""we used conditional logit models to test our hypotheses (McFadden 1984).""
  - ""Data on offences and offenders' activity nodes were extracted from the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA).""
  - ""To overcome computational challenges involved in including every SA2 in each offender's 'choice set' of possible alternatives-given the number of alternatives, offenders, variables and available computing capacity-we sampled from all potential SA2 alternatives (n = 2153) to construct a manageable set for each offender.""
  - ""Each SA2 alternative was also coded 1 or 0 based on the presence or absence of the nearest of each type of node within five distance bands extending to 5 km from the SA2""
  - ""The outcome variable reflects the location choice for each offender; from their set of potential SA2s, it is the one in which their reference offence was committed.""
  - ""In line with previous DSCM studies, we operationalised opportunity as the number of potential targets, or an indicator thereof, in each spatial unit.""
  - ""Several limitations of this study affect how our results can be interpreted. First, although the results demonstrate the ability of police data to indicate crime-salient elements of offenders' activity spaces, we may have missed or understated theoretically important relationships for under-represented nodes.""",,"- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) used in the study is the New Zealand Census Unit 'Statistical Area 2' (SA2), which approximates neighborhoods with a population of 2000-4000 residents in urban areas and 1000-3000 in rural areas.
- The median land area of the sampled SA2s is 1.2km², indicating the spatial resolution.
- The study was conducted in New Zealand, as indicated by the use of New Zealand Census Units and data from the New Zealand Police.
- The total area of the study site is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied to be the entire country given the use of national data.
- The types of crime analyzed include residential burglaries, non-residential burglaries, commercial robberies, personal robberies, and extra-familial sex offences.
- The type of discrete choice model used is the conditional logit model.
- The sampling approach for alternatives involved stratified importance sampling to construct a manageable set of SA2s for each offender.
- Independent variables included in the model are based on the presence or absence of different types of activity nodes within SA2s and distance bands, as well as opportunity variables such as the number of potential targets.
- The population per spatial unit is described in terms of the number of residents in SA2s.
- The choice of SA2 as the SUoA is justified by its approximation to neighborhoods and its use in other studies.
- Data sources used include the New Zealand Police National Intelligence Application (NIA) and New Zealand Statistics Census and Business Demography data.
- Limitations mentioned include potential under-representation of certain activity nodes due to data limitations.","  - ""Understanding the relationships between individual offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies.""
  - ""Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand.""
  - ""Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations).""
  - ""The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour.""
  - ""To test our hypotheses, we employed discrete crime location choice modelling (DSCM).""
  - ""In DSCM analysis, the dataset needs to include not only the attributes of chosen locations but those of alternative locations that could have been chosen but were not.""
  - ""We included activity locations that were less common in the data, less routinely visited, and less recent, erring towards inclusion of data.""
  - ""The outcome variable reflects the location choice for each offender; from their set of potential SA2s, it is the one in which their reference offence was committed.""
  - ""As predicted by hypothesis 1, offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to activity nodes than farther away.""
  - ""crime opportunity was positively associated with crime location choice, when controlling for the presence of activity nodes.""
  - ""This study aimed to identify near which of a range of activity locations (nodes) recorded in police data offenders are more likely to commit crime.""
  - ""Almost all nodes-including those not considered separately in previous studies: intimate partner and other relatives' homes, school, work, police involved incidents and other police contacts-were significantly and positively associated with crime location choice, at least at short distances.""
  - ""The lack of association between work nodes and residential burglary could reflect a lack of residential burglary opportunities around work nodes likely concentrated in non-residential areas.""
  - ""The lack of association between prior victim/witness events and commercial robbery indicates that these events were not conducive to the acquisition of knowledge of commercial robbery opportunities.""
  - ""The few negative associations-at longer distances-were marginally significant and small.""
  - ""Consistent with our expectations based on crime pattern theory (Brantingham and Brantingham 1991, 1993a) , crime was almost always most likely in the immediate vicinity of activity nodes, declining monotonically with distance.""
  - ""Home and prior crimes showed the strongest associations with crime location choice, over longer distances, followed by homes of immediate family.""
  - ""The apparent wider awareness space around home nodes likely reflects that home nodes tend to anchor other routine activity locations that might not appear in the data""
  - ""The patterns of distance decay for different activity nodes evidence the extent of offenders' awareness space around different activity nodes and the likelihood that they will identify criminal opportunities within that space.""
  - ""Differences in relative associations between crime locations and different nodes were largely consistent with the hypotheses derived from Curtis-Ham et al.'s (2020) theoretical model, thus lending further empirical support to this extension of crime pattern theory.""
  - ""Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to activity nodes that were higher frequency (home versus family homes; immediate family versus other relatives); likely to impart more relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations); and of the same location type as the crime target (home for residential burglary versus non-residential burglary and commercial robbery).""",,"- The study examines the relationship between offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations using discrete spatial choice models.
- The study uses data from New Zealand, focusing on various crime types such as residential and non-residential burglaries, commercial and personal robberies, and extra-familial sex offences.
- The spatial unit of analysis is the New Zealand Census Unit 'Statistical Area 2' (SA2), which approximates neighborhoods.
- The study finds that offenders are more likely to commit crimes closer to their activity locations, especially those visited frequently or that provide relevant knowledge about crime opportunities.
- The study supports the extension of crime pattern theory by differentiating activity locations and crime types.
- The methodology involves discrete crime location choice modeling (DSCM) with a focus on the proximity of activity nodes and crime opportunities.
- The study includes various activity locations such as homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions.
- The findings indicate that home and prior crimes have strong associations with crime location choice, with a distance decay pattern observed for most nodes.
- Crime opportunity is positively associated with crime location choice when controlling for activity nodes.","  - ""Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand.""

  - ""To test our hypotheses, we employed discrete crime location choice modelling (DSCM). DSCM is specifically designed and therefore frequently used to analyse hypotheses such as ours about the relative likelihood of an offender choosing a location to commit crime, given attributes of the location such as its distance from an activity node or its crime opportunities""
  - ""Each SA2 alternative was also coded 1 or 0 based on the presence or absence of the nearest of each type of node within five distance bands extending to 5 km from the SA2 (with thresholds at 200 m, 500 m, 1 km, 2 km, and 5 km from the SA2 boundary).""
  - ""In line with previous DSCM studies, we operationalised opportunity as the number of potential targets, or an indicator thereof, in each spatial unit.""
  - ""For residential burglary, we used the number of dwellings (see similarly Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta 2005;Frith 2019;Townsley et al. 2015). For non-residential burglary, we used the total number of business units, which directly measures the number of non-residential burglary targets in the SA2.""
  - ""For commercial robbery, we used the number of business units in industry categories that mapped to the types of crime locations used to identify commercial robberies.""
  - ""For personal robbery, we used the number of business units in commercial or public industries, combining the types of facilities included in prior DSCM studies as separate covariates (Bernasco et al. 2013;Long et al. 2018;Song et al. 2019).""
  - ""we used conditional logit models to test our hypotheses (McFadden 1984). The conditional logit model evaluates the likelihood of a choice alternative (SA2) being selected given its attributes (e.g. presence of a home in the SA2, presence of nearest prior crime 200-500 m away).""
  - ""crime opportunity was positively associated with crime location choice, when controlling for the presence of activity nodes.""",,"- The study uses discrete spatial choice models to analyze the relationship between crime locations and various activity locations such as homes, family members' homes, schools, and prior crimes.
- The study differentiates between various types of activity locations and crime types, indicating a focus on understanding how these different locations influence crime location choices.
- The use of distance bands and the coding of activity nodes within these bands suggest that distance and accessibility are considered as variables.
- The operationalization of opportunity as the number of potential targets in each spatial unit indicates that crime opportunity is a variable.
- The study uses conditional logit models to test hypotheses, which suggests that the models are used to evaluate the likelihood of choosing a location based on its attributes.

  - ""The results provide some support for the hypothesis that the level of collective efficacy in a tract reduces its attraction to robbers, although the effect is small and is the only one not to reach the 1 percent significance level.""
  - ""The third step in the multivariate analysis is the test of individual level interactions, which are hypotheses 10 and 11.""
  - ""First, it was hypothesized that the proximity criterion would be more important for juvenile offenders than for adult offenders.""

  - ""The research presented here confirms the discrete choice model as a useful tool for modeling criminal location choice, in part because it distinguishes the residence of the offender from the place where the offense takes place.""
  - ""Offender mobility is affected not only by distance, which is a physical barrier between the offender's home and a crime location, but also by social barriers.""
  - ""Social barriers reflect dissimilarities between the community where the crime is committed and either the offender's community or the offender himself or herself.""
  - ""We have shown a social barrier to exist between census tracts with dissimilar racial and ethnic compositions.""
  - ""The remarkable thing about these social barriers is that they discourage offender travel in addition to the impeding effect of the distance between the origin and the destination tract.""
  - ""In short: If offenders do not commit offenses in the vicinity of their own homes, then they are most likely to search for targets in nearby areas.""
  - ""When they must subsequently choose among various nearby areas, they will choose one that is most similar to where they themselves live.""
  - ""Resident area is one explanatory variable to estimate the offender's choice of incident area.""
  - ""By considering geographic distance as part of a tradeoff between various ""pros"" and ""cons,"" the discrete choice model integrates journey to crime research with research that explores the geographic distribution of criminal opportunities.""
  - ""Furthermore, because the model is based on the explicit formulation of choice criteria that individual offenders are expected to use, the link among theory, model formulation, and hypothesis testing is short.""
  - ""We specified and tested hypotheses easily on differences between offenders.""

- Variables include demographic (age, racial/ethnic origin), economic (retail employment), land use (high school presence), crime opportunity (drug and prostitution arrests), and social/behavioral (collective efficacy).
- Key findings indicate that proximity to the offender's home, racial and ethnic similarity, and the presence of crime attractors like drug markets and retail activities influence robbery location choice.

  - ""The second is that we develop a new way to measure qualitative dissimilarity between communities, which helps us to examine how racial and ethnic segregation affects the spatial target choices of Chicago robbers.""

  - ""For the study area, there were 198 LSOAs, each with a population of around 1,524 people and about 662 residential households.""
  - ""Data for crimes detected by the police were acquired for the county of Dorset (UK) for the 5-year period January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005.""
  - ""The type of model used, also referred to as a random utility model (for an overview, see Train, 2003), assumes that when making a decision, a chooser (in this case an offender) selects from a set of alternatives the choice that maximizes their perceived utility.""",,"REASONING:

- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is the U.K. census Lower Super Output Area (LSOA), which is a standard geographic unit used in the UK for statistical purposes. This is explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- The data collection period is from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005, as stated in the paper.
- The study was conducted in the county of Dorset, UK, which is the jurisdiction for the data collection.
- The type of crime analyzed is theft from vehicles (TFV), as mentioned in the abstract and throughout the paper.
- The type of discrete choice model used is a conditional logit model, as indicated by the description of the model and the reference to McFadden's work.
- The sampling approach for alternatives is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that a full choice set was used within the study area.
- Independent variables included in the model are distance to offender’s home, distance to city center, presence of schools, presence of train stations, connectivity via major roads, population turnover, socioeconomic heterogeneity, number of car parks, and number of cars and vans. These variables are derived from various sources such as census data and police records.
- The average population per spatial unit (LSOA) is around 1,524 people.
- The choice of SUoA is justified by its use in previous studies and its suitability for capturing relevant spatial patterns at a fine resolution.
- Data sources used include police incident reports and census data.
- Limitations or trade-offs in SUoA selection are not explicitly discussed in terms of size or model performance.","  - ""Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated.""
  - ""Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories.""
  - ""We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes.""
  - ""For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network.""
  - ""The use of this approach allows us to compare the characteristics of those locations where a sample of offenders chose to commit offenses with those locations that could have been chosen, but were not.""
  - ""Data for crimes detected by the police were acquired for the county of Dorset (UK) for the 5-year period January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005.""
  - ""The unit of analysis selected was the U.K. census Lower Super Output Area (LSOA).""
  - ""For the study area, there were 198 LSOAs, each with a population of around 1,524 people and about 662 residential households.""
  - ""Using a discrete choice framework, we find evidence to support both theoretical perspectives.""
  - ""The present study demonstrates that this is true for a type of crime not studied previously, and for a geographical location not studied elsewhere, thereby extending the external validity of the research base and demonstrating the generality of these theories at explaining the distribution of different types of crime.""
  - ""The influence of the road network on adult offender spatial decision making is a particularly novel result and this finding, along with those concerned with the impact of routine activity nodes on offender spatial decision making, has potential policy implications for those involved in the development of urban spaces.""
  - ""The results also suggest that the placement of new facilities that might attract people to an area could increase the probability with which crime will occur in them.""
  - ""The fact that younger offenders did not appear to exhibit a preference for targeting areas that were closer to the city center, but appeared to prefer those located further away is a potentially puzzling finding.""
  - ""In line with social disorganization theory, it appears that offenders were more likely to target those areas in which residents have the least potential to form social ties, either because population turnover is relatively high, or because the residents come from different socioeconomic backgrounds (or both).""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=16 table_on_page=1>```

- Sampling strategy: All detected residential burglaries committed by burglars living in The Hague
- Choice set size: 1174 residential burglaries, 750 offenders","  - ""Using data on residential burglaries and residential burglars in The Hague, this study addresses the issue of whether solitary offenders choose their target areas differently from the way offender groups do.""
  - ""The Hague comprises of 89 residential neighbourhoods. The average neighbourhood has an area of 0.65 square kilometres, is the home to 4952 residents and contains 2380 residential units.""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, data were used that pertain to all detected residential burglaries committed by burglars living in the city of The Hague, the Netherlands, in the period 1996-2004.""
  - ""The Hague is situated at the coast of the North Sea. With a population of about 440,000, it is the third largest city in the Netherlands.""
  - ""The geometric positions of the 89 residential neighbourhoods are displayed in Figure 1""
  - ""The affluence of neighbourhoods is measured by the average value of residential properties in the neighbourhood, the percentage of owner-occupied properties, and the mean income per resident.""
  - ""The physical accessibility of properties in the neighbourhoods is also based on the real estate registration system of the city of The Hague.""
  - ""The number of properties in a neighbourhood functions as a control variable: it is not a part of the theoretical model, but obviously it is part of the opportunity structure for burglary.""
  - ""Hypotheses on location choice can be very well formalised using the random utility maximization (RUM) approach, and with the associated statistical conditional logit model (McFadden, 1973).""
  - ""The outcomes of estimating the choice model are presented in Table 8""
  - ""The own neighbourhood and other nearby neighbourhoods are the most likely targets for burglary, not only for solitary burglars, but for burglar groups as well.""
  - ""Another criterion that appears to drive the target areas choice of burglars is the physical accessibility of the properties in the area.""
  - ""The low detection rate could bias the results if a relationship exists between criteria of location choice and the probability of arrest.""",,"- The study focuses on residential burglaries in The Hague, Netherlands, using data from 1996 to 2004.
- The spatial unit of analysis is the neighborhood, with The Hague divided into 89 residential neighborhoods.
- The average area of each neighborhood is 0.65 square kilometers, with an average population of 4,952 residents and 2,380 residential units.
- The study uses a conditional logit model to analyze the choice of target areas.
- Independent variables include affluence (measured by property value, income, and owner-occupied properties), physical accessibility (based on real estate registration), and social disorganization (measured by ethnic heterogeneity and residential mobility).
- The study does not mention any specific limitations or trade-offs in the selection of the spatial unit of analysis.
- Main findings include the importance of proximity to the home neighborhood and physical accessibility in choosing target areas for burglary.","  - ""Using data on residential burglaries and residential burglars in The Hague, this study addresses the issue of whether solitary offenders choose their target areas differently from the way offender groups do.""
  - ""The results support the postulated relevance of physical accessibility and proximity to the offenders' homes for both single offenders and co-offending groups.""
  - ""The detection rate for residential burglary in The Hague is 7%.""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, data were used that pertain to all detected residential burglaries committed by burglars living in the city of The Hague, the Netherlands, in the period 1996-2004.""
  - ""The Hague comprises of 89 residential neighbourhoods.""
  - ""The average neighbourhood has an area of 0.65 square kilometres, is the home to 4952 residents and contains 2380 residential units.""
  - ""Data on residential burglaries were obtained from the police force that services the greater The Hague area.""
  - ""The affluence of neighbourhoods is measured by the average value of residential properties in the neighbourhood, the percentage of owner-occupied properties, and the mean income per resident.""
  - ""The physical accessibility of properties in the neighbourhoods is also based on the real estate registration system of the city of The Hague.""
  - ""Ethnographic research could shed some light on this issue, although the presence of non-arrested accomplices or co-offenders seems to be one of the few things that detained and convicted offenders are not very eager to talk about.""
  - ""The outcomes of estimating the choice model are presented in Table 8""
  - ""The results partially support the hypotheses, because the effects of physical accessibility, proximity, and a special proximity aspect, the home neighbourhood, are all significant in the hypothesised direction, supporting hypotheses 2 and 4.""
  - ""The hypotheses 1, 3, and 5, however, are not supported, as the effects of affluence, social disorganisation, and proximity to the city centre, are not significant.""
  - ""Apparently there is a strong preference for the own neighbourhood as burglary target area.""
  - ""Hypotheses 5-10 refer to the second research question, which is the question whether solitary burglars and burglar groups differ in terms of the criteria used for choosing target areas.""
  - ""The tests have been performed on all parameters, even if they were not significant in the separate models, because in principle, parameter estimates can differ significantly when both estimates separately do not differ significantly from 1.""
  - ""Except for the fact that solitary offenders appear to have a stronger preference for searching a burglary target in their own neighbourhood, there are no significant differences.""
  - ""The outcomes thus partially confirm the general theory on burglary target area choice, but they refute the postulated differences between solitary offenders and group offenders.""","  - ""(Page 13, Table 1) | Variable                          | Solitary offender |                | Offender group   |                | χ² test difference |

  - ""To prevent a temporal edge effect it was necessary to assure that for each burglary the data would allow us to look back over a fixed period of time to establish the offender's previous burglaries. For this reason, it was decided that burglaries committed during the first 2 years (2007) (2008) would be used to establish each offender's history of past burglaries in the study area.""
  - ""The concept of crime location choice presumes spatial units of analysis, which are the alternative locations that burglars choose from when deciding on where to commit a burglary. Whereas the contemporary literature on the geography of crime emphasizes the analytical superiority of small spatial units (e.g., micro-places like face blocks or street segments), the implementation of units of such small size in spatial choice models is fraught with complex issues, including the need to use 'sampling from alternatives' to solve the intractability of the estimation problem, and the requirement to estimate multiple-level spillover effects (Bernasco et al., 2013) . As a compromise, we decided to use the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) geography as the basic spatial unit of analysis.""
  - ""LSOAs are defined on the basis of proximity and social homogeneity measures (type of dwelling and nature of tenure) and have a population of approximately 1,500 residents and 600 households.""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, a discrete spatial crime location choice approach is used (Bernasco et al., 2013;Bernasco & Ruiter, 2014) in which every burglary is conceptualized as a discrete choice amongst all 1,687 LSOAs in the study area, and a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relative weight of each of the LSOA characteristics in the burglar's decision.""
  - ""The estimated model parameters (odds ratios, confidence intervals, and significance level indicators) are listed in Table A1 in the Appendix.""
  - ""The findings strongly support all three conjectures.""
  - ""Our findings thus present good news for crime pattern theory.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=25 table_on_page=1>```markdown

  - ""And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk.""
  - ""Our findings also demonstrate that ""taste"" preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.""
  - ""The aim of prior research has been to examine the role of the road network on crime, but it has failed to isolate the influence of these two mechanisms.""
  - ""To address these shortcomings, in this article, we make several novel contributions.""
  - ""We use a discrete choice approach (McFadden, 1974), or more accurately an offense location choice approach (Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), to estimate empirically how the opportunities that are targeted by burglars differ from those that are not.""
  - ""Our research differs from previous studies of offender spatial decision-making in two important ways.""
  - ""First, in most previous studies, scholars have examined offender location choice at the area level (for the exceptions, see Bernasco, 2010b, and Vandeviver et al., 2015).""
  - ""Second, we build on previous work (Davies and Johnson, 2015) and introduce to the discrete choice literature a methodological approach that aims to estimate independently how the road network influences offender awareness of crime opportunities, on the one hand, and guardian potential at particular locations, on the other.""
  - ""By following Townsley, Birks, Ruiter, et al. (2015) , we also recognize that offenders may vary in the extent to which their spatial decision-making is affected by different factors, and so we employ mixed logit statistical models to estimate parameters and how they vary across offenders.""
  - ""The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, theoretical perspectives and research are reviewed to introduce the theoretical model.""
  - ""The second and third sections describe the data and analytic strategy, respectively.""
  - ""The latter includes a discussion of the application of graph theory to quantify the character of the road network, as well as the statistical model employed.""
  - ""The fourth and fifth sections present and discuss the results.""
  - ""The rational choice perspective (Cornish and Clarke, 1986) describes offenders, such as burglars, as nonarbitrary decision-makers who consider (however briefly) the costs and benefits of action alternatives, including the decision of where to offend (Clarke and Felson, 1993).""
  - ""It is suggested that such decision-making will be bounded by imperfect and incomplete information, and that future choices will be informed by the outcome of previous ones (Cornish and Clarke, 1986; see also Bennett and Wright, 1984;Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991; Wright and Decker, 1994)""
  - ""Nevertheless, although choices made may not appear rational to an observer, it is assumed that selections are made that aim to maximize the perceived utility of a decision and minimize the expected costs.""
  - ""In particular, the distance an offender must travel to offend has consistently been shown by researchers to influence offender location choice in both quantitative and ethnographic studies.""
  - ""For example, offenders have consistently reported (e.g., Brown and Altman, 1981;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985;Repetto, 1974), and the results of analyses of the journey to crime (Snook, 2004;Wiles and Costello, 2000) have shown, that the likelihood of an offender selecting a location at which to offend is inversely proportional to the distance he or she must travel to reach it.""
  - ""The aim of most studies of the journey to crime has been to examine the Euclidean distance between locations (e.g., Clare, Fernandez, and Morgan, 2009), and even though this provides a good estimate of the likely cost of travel, it is clearly imperfect.""
  - ""The cost of travel is intrinsically linked to the configuration and properties (such as the vehicle speed limit) of the road network as this determines how quick and how easy it is to travel between any two locations.""
  - ""Consequently, in the current study, we expect to find the following:

Hypothesis 1: Street segments that are quicker to travel to (in terms of estimated travel time) from the burglar's home will be more likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""In addition to the fact that the selection of targets near to an offender's home location minimizes the cost of travel, this preference is expected to emerge for other reasons encapsulated by crime pattern theory (e.g., Brantingham and Brantingham, 1993).""
  - ""According to the theory, like everyone else, offenders are assumed to frequent activity nodes routinely, such as their home and workplace.""
  - ""As a consequence of doing so, they develop an awareness of these places and the routes between them.""
  - ""This is not necessary for offending, but it shapes offenders' familiarity and awareness of the criminal opportunities within these spaces.""
  - ""According to crime pattern theory, offenders are believed to prefer such opportunities to alternative targets for two reasons.""
  - ""First, offenders cannot select targets of which they are not aware (Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985).""
  - ""And, second, targeting locations about which something is known reduces uncertainty about the likely outcome of that choice (Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994).""
  - ""As such, we predict the following:

Hypothesis 2: Street segments that are more likely to be familiar to an offender are more likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""In previous studies, scholars have assumed that the distance between a location and an offender's routine activity nodes (e.g., the home) provides a reasonable estimate of that location's familiarity.""
  - ""This assumption is not unreasonable as the findings from qualitative research with burglars have revealed that they are typically most familiar with areas that are closest to their home locations (e.g., Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985).""
  - ""Nevertheless, at the street segment level, an individual's familiarity with locations will be more nuanced than this, and it is likely to be a function of how frequently he or she travels to or through them (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1993;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985).""
  - ""Although distance will influence this awareness, so too will the configuration of the road network because this affects the likelihood that an individual will travel along a particular street to reach that or other locations (e.g., Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994).""
  - ""Some streets (such as major roads) may feature in many journeys, whereas others less so (cul de sacs and dead ends, for instance).""
  - ""On the whole, streets rarely traveled will be less familiar than those commonly used.""
  - ""Even though it is not possible to determine which streets offenders travel during their routine activities without collecting extensive primary data, it is possible to employ techniques from graph theory to estimate which routes and, hence, which street segments, they are most likely to use and be familiar with (near to activity nodes such as their home location).""
  - ""To do this, for each offender, we compute a novel idiosyncratic variation of the graph theory metric betweenness.""
  - ""Betweenness (which is discussed in more detail later in the article) has been used elsewhere (e.g., Davies and Johnson, 2015) to estimate overall movement potential through the road network.""
  - ""Our idiosyncratic variant is intended to estimate how likely each offender is to use particular street segments and, hence, to develop an awareness of them.""
  - ""Consequently, for hypothesis 2, we specifically predict that offenders are most likely to commit offenses on those street segments with high idiosyncratic betweenness values.""
  - ""The configuration of the road network also influences the movement of people going about their everyday activities (e.g., Hillier, 2007;Penn, 2003)-people who (in the case of residential burglary) have the potential to provide ambient guardianship (Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991;Felson, 1994) or to regulate behavior (Miethe and Meier, 1994).""
  - ""Nevertheless, the potential role of passers-by is more complex than simply a function of their presence or absence.""
  - ""To explain, consider two theories of urban design. In the case of the first, Jacobs (1961) suggested that guardianship is provided by everyone not engaged in criminal activity who is present on a street.""
  - ""She suggested that their presence provides ""eyes on the street"" and that this ""natural surveillance"" has the potential to deter crime.""
  - ""Yet, according to Newman's (1972) defensible space perspective (see also Coleman, 1985), whether the ambient population deters crime depends on exactly who is present and where they are.""
  - ""According to this perspective, territoriality, which is communicated by environmental cues regarding who (such as residents) is likely to be responsible for and expected to use (or pass through) a space, plays a key role.""
  - ""Where it exists, for example, through the segregation of public and private spaces, it ""may make a stranger more obvious and residents more watchful"" (Newman, 1980: 142)""
  - ""In contrast, on streets where territoriality is lacking, the attendant guardianship (potential) is expected to be diminished as there will be ambiguity as to who is responsible for that space.""
  - ""Although both perspectives champion similar concepts, they principally differ in terms of how they predict the movement of nonlocals along a street to influence crime risk.""
  - ""For the former, anyone, including nonlocals, can provide additional guardianship and this should deter crime.""
  - ""In contrast, according to the latter, on streets where there are large flows of nonlocals, anonymity will be increased and this will be detrimental to the informal guardianship provided by those who are local and live on or nearby that street, or might otherwise feel responsible for it.""
  - ""The findings of quantitative research intended to test these two theories are somewhat mixed and can be divided into two branches.""
  - ""The first, which includes area-level (White, 1990) and more recently street-level studies (Armitage, 2007;Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994;Johnson and Bowers, 2010;Rengert and Wasilchick, 2000), generally find that locations that are expected to have greater through movement are more likely to experience crime.""
  - ""In most of these studies, researchers have used simple ordinal or categorical variables (e.g., the number of other roads a street directly intersects, or major versus minor road categorizations) as proxies for traffic levels (Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994;Johnson and Bowers, 2010;White, 1990), but in recent studies, researchers (Davies and Johnson, 2015) have used more sophisticated metrics (see the Graph Theory section) and have come to the same conclusions.""
  - ""The second branch of research involves metrics computed with the space syntax methodology.""
  - ""Researchers who have used this approach have employed a form of graph theory, but generally, they have found opposing findings to those discussed earlier (e.g., Hillier, 2004;Shu, 2000).""
  - ""That is, consistent with Jacob's (1961) ideas, at locations that are expected to possess greater volumes of passers-by, less crime is observed.""
  - ""That said, in some studies, research teams have employed the space syntax methodology and have reported different results.""
  - ""For example, Hillier and Sahbaz (2009) found that streets that were characterized as being likely used for more localized movements tended to experience less crime (see also Nubani and Wineman, 2005).""
  - ""Moreover, many studies that use the space syntax methodology have been weaker in terms of the statistical methods applied (for an extended discussion, see Summers and Johnson, 2016), often having relied on descriptive statistics (Shu, 2000) or having failed to account for (any) other predictor variables known to influence crime (Hillier, 2004;Hillier and Sahbaz, 2009).""
  - ""It must also be noted that no previous research of this kind has been designed to account for where offenders reside, and so the influence of offender decision-making has been conflated in these studies.""
  - ""The aim of qualitative research (e.g., Cromwell, Olson, and Avery, 1991; Wright and Decker, 1994) is to provide more insight from the offender's perspective.""
  - ""Qualitative research suggests that most (but not all) offenders avoid targeting locations where they are likely to be seen by neighbors or others (Bennett and Wright, 1984).""
  - ""Nevertheless, in such studies, researchers have not, as far as we are aware, examined how the configuration of the road network affects offender perceptions of this type of guardianship.""
  - ""On the basis of the preceding text, we consider the following hypotheses (detailed descriptions of the variables derived to test hypotheses are provided later in the article).""
  - ""First, in support of the ""eyes on the street"" perspective where all passer-by guardianship is beneficial: Hypothesis 3: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of any passers-by (estimated with a metric of overall pedestrian betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""Second, motivated by both Jacob's ""eyes on the street"" and Newman's ""defensible space"" perspectives, where local passer-by guardianship is expected to be beneficial: Hypothesis 4: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of local passers-by (estimated with a metric of local betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""Third, as suggested by the defensible space but not by the ""eyes on the street"" perspective:

Hypothesis 5: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of nonlocal passers-by (estimated with a metric of nonlocal betweenness) is higher are more likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""Although these ideas best apply to pedestrian movement, it is also important to consider vehicular movements.""
  - ""In their study of offender decision-making, Bennett and Wright (1984) showed convicted burglars video recordings of 36 different homes and then asked them to indicate which they would target and why.""
  - ""Among the factors offenders identified as influencing their choices was the type of road, with busy roads being avoided as ""the offender might be seen by drivers of passing cars"" (p. 64).""
  - ""Thus: Hypothesis 6: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of vehicular passers-by (estimated with a metric of overall vehicular betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for a burglary.""
  - ""Although our focus in this article concerns the role of the road network on criminal location choice, other factors will clearly influence offender decision-making and need to be accounted for.""
  - ""First, according to social disorganization (Shaw and McKay, 1942) and related theories (e.g., Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush, 2001;Sampson and Groves, 1989;Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997), the extent to which residents can exert informal social control to deter crime is influenced by how closely knit their neighborhood is.""
  - ""Less cohesive neighborhoods lack communal ties either because (for example) they are transient or because residents do not share common values.""
  - ""According to this theory, in such communities, residents may not feel responsible for their neighborhood and so will be less willing to act collectively as guardians against crime.""
  - ""In previous studies of the kind described here (e.g., Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;Clare, Fernandez, and Morgan, 2009), levels of social disorganization have been estimated by researchers using census data that characterize the (lack of) stability, or heterogeneity, of neighborhoods with variables such as population turnover, ethnic diversity (e.g., Miethe and Meier, 1994), and socioeconomic diversity (Johnson and Summers, 2015).""
  - ""In the current study, we control for these factors in the analyses that follow.""
  - ""Offense location choices are also likely influenced by the type of targets available.""
  - ""For example, as suggested elsewhere (Maguire and Bennett, 1982;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985), burglars are financially motivated and are therefore likely to prefer more affluent dwellings where greater proceeds are expected.""
  - ""Conversely, it is also likely that more affluent dwellings will have better security measures and are therefore likely to be more difficult to break into.""
  - ""As such, and following the approach taken in previous studies (e.g., Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), the affluence of each possible target location is accounted for in the analyses presented.""
  - ""Finally, it is important to note that even if an offender chooses targets randomly, roads with more homes are more likely to be selected.""
  - ""To account for this, the number of dwellings on a street segment is also included as a control variable.""
  - ""A final point that emerges from the results published in the qualitative literature (e.g., Bennett and Wright, 1984;Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991;Nee and Meenaghan, 2006;Rengert and Wasilchick, 2000; Wright and Decker, 1994) and in recent quantitative studies (Bouhana, Johnson, and Porter, 2016;Townsley and Sidebottom, 2010) is that although certain features often seem to influence offender decision-making, there is also clear variation across offenders in those factors.""
  - ""For example, in their interviews with burglars, Bennett and Wright (1984) found that the presence of passers-by deterred approximately one half of their sample either unconditionally or under some conditions, whereas the remaining half reported being undeterred by the presence of others.""",,"REASONING:

1. The paper introduces a novel approach to understanding burglars' spatial decision-making by using a mixed logit model to analyze residential burglaries at the street segment level. This is a significant departure from previous studies that typically examined location choice at a broader area level.

2. The authors develop new graph theory metrics to estimate offender awareness and ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. This methodological innovation allows for a more nuanced understanding of how the road network influences crime opportunities and guardianship.

3. The study finds that metrics related to offender familiarity and effort are significant predictors of burglary location choices, supporting crime pattern theory. This suggests that offenders are more likely to target locations they are familiar with and that are easier to reach.

4. The paper also explores the concept of defensible space, finding that nonlocal pedestrian traffic increases burglary risk, while local pedestrian traffic decreases it. This aligns with Newman's theory that the presence of nonlocal passers-by can diminish the effectiveness of local guardianship.

5. The authors highlight the variability in offenders' ""taste"" preferences, indicating that different offenders may be influenced by different factors in their spatial decision-making. This variability presents a challenge for future research to explain.

6. The study's use of a mixed logit model allows for the estimation of parameters that vary across offenders, providing insights into individual differences in decision-making processes.

7. The paper's findings contribute to the understanding of how the physical environment, specifically the road network, shapes crime patterns by influencing both offender awareness and guardianship potential.

8. The study's methodological contributions, including the use of graph theory metrics and mixed logit models, offer a more sophisticated framework for analyzing crime location choices and highlight the importance of considering individual differences among offenders.","  - ""With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level.""

  - ""Among the factors offenders identified as influencing their choices was the type of road, with busy roads being avoided as ""the offender might be seen by drivers of passing cars"" (p. 64).""
  - ""Thus: Hypothesis 6: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of vehicular passers-by (estimated with a metric of overall vehicular betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for a burglary.""
  - ""Although our focus in this article concerns the role of the road network on criminal location choice, other factors will clearly influence offender decision-making and need to be accounted for.""
  - ""First, according to social disorganization (Shaw and McKay, 1942) and related theories (e.g., Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush, 2001;Sampson and Groves, 1989;Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997), the extent to which residents can exert informal social control to deter crime is influenced by how closely knit their neighborhood is.""
  - ""Less cohesive neighborhoods lack communal ties either because (for example) they are transient or because residents do not share common values.""
  - ""According to this theory, in such communities, residents may not feel responsible for their neighborhood and so will be less willing to act collectively as guardians against crime.""
  - ""In previous studies of the kind described here (e.g., Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;Clare, Fernandez, and Morgan, 2009), levels of social disorganization have been estimated by researchers using census data that characterize the (lack of) stability, or heterogeneity, of neighborhoods with variables such as population turnover, ethnic diversity (e.g., Miethe and Meier, 1994), and socioeconomic diversity (Johnson and Summers, 2015).""
  - ""In the current study, we control for these factors in the analyses that follow.""
  - ""Offense location choices are also likely influenced by the type of targets available.""
  - ""For example, as suggested elsewhere (Maguire and Bennett, 1982;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985), burglars are financially motivated and are therefore likely to prefer more affluent dwellings where greater proceeds are expected.""
  - ""Conversely, it is also likely that more affluent dwellings will have better security measures and are therefore likely to be more difficult to break into.""
  - ""As such, and following the approach taken in previous studies (e.g., Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), the affluence of each possible target location is accounted for in the analyses presented.""
  - ""Finally, it is important to note that even if an offender chooses targets randomly, roads with more homes are more likely to be selected.""
  - ""To account for this, the number of dwellings on a street segment is also included as a control variable.""
  - ""A final point that emerges from the results published in the qualitative literature (e.g., Bennett and Wright, 1984;Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991;Nee and Meenaghan, 2006;Rengert and Wasilchick, 2000; Wright and Decker, 1994) and in recent quantitative studies (Bouhana, Johnson, and Porter, 2016;Townsley and Sidebottom, 2010) is that although certain features often seem to influence offender decision-making, there is also clear variation across offenders in those factors.""
  - ""For example, in their interviews with burglars, Bennett and Wright (1984) found that the presence of passers-by deterred approximately one half of their sample either unconditionally or under some conditions, whereas the remaining half reported being undeterred by the presence of others.""",,"QUOTES:

- ""With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level.""
- ""Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship.""
- ""As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices.""
- ""And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk.""
- ""The findings also demonstrate that 'taste' preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.""
- ""The aim of prior research has been to examine the role of the road network on crime, but it has failed to isolate the influence of these two mechanisms.""
- ""To address these shortcomings, in this article, we make several novel contributions.""
- ""We use a discrete choice approach (McFadden, 1974), or more accurately an offense location choice approach (Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), to estimate empirically how the opportunities that are targeted by burglars differ from those that are not.""

- ""First, in most previous studies, scholars have examined offender location choice at the area level (for the exceptions, see Bernasco, 2010b, and Vandeviver et al., 2015).""
- ""Second, we build on previous work (Davies and Johnson, 2015) and introduce to the discrete choice literature a methodological approach that aims to estimate independently how the road network influences offender awareness of crime opportunities, on the one hand, and guardian potential at particular locations, on the other.""
- ""By following Townsley, Birks, Ruiter, et al. (2015), we also recognize that offenders may vary in the extent to which their spatial decision-making is affected by different factors, and so we employ mixed logit statistical models to estimate parameters and how they vary across offenders.""

- ""The fourth and fifth sections present and discuss the results.""
- ""The rational choice perspective (Cornish and Clarke, 1986) describes offenders, such as burglars, as nonarbitrary decision-makers who consider (however briefly) the costs and benefits of action alternatives, including the decision of where to offend (Clarke and Felson, 1993).""
- ""It is suggested that such decision-making will be bounded by imperfect and incomplete information, and that future choices will be informed by the outcome of previous ones (Cornish and Clarke, 1986; see also Bennett and Wright, 1984;Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991; Wright and Decker, 1994).""

  - ""Distance from the city centre: Due to the concentration of facilities and services in or near most city centres, including in the study area, it is expected to be visited more often, including by offenders, than equivalent other areas. The city centre, and nearby areas, are therefore expected to be more likely to appear in an offender's awareness space and the opportunities to be more familiar. Offenders are therefore expected to more likely offend in neighbourhoods closer to the city centre.""
  - ""Ethnic heterogeneity: Various qualitative research describes acquisitive offenders as preferring to offend in socially disorganised neighbourhoods (Bennett et al., 1984;Wright and Decker, 2002). Therefore, because ethnic heterogeneity will likely impede social ties from forming, for example because of cultural or linguistic differences, it is expected offenders are more likely to offend in more ethnically diverse neighbourhoods.""
  - ""Socioeconomic heterogeneity: Like ethnic heterogeneity, the forming of social ties is also likely to be inhibited from forming when residents are from very different socioeconomic statuses (Hirschfield and Bowers, 1997). As such, it is expected that offenders are more likely to offend in more socioeconomically diverse neighbourhoods.""
  - ""Residential Churn: Similar to ethnic and socioeconomic heterogeneity, because neighbourhoods with elevated levels of resident turnover would be expected to inhibit community from forming, it is expected that offenders are more likely to offend in neighbourhoods with higher residential churn.""
  - ""Affluence: As suggested elsewhere (Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985;Light et al., 1993;Wright and Decker, 2002), acquisitive offenders are primarily driven by financial benefit. They would therefore be expected to be more likely to offend in more affluent neighbourhoods where more valuable targets are more likely to be found. However, on the other hand, because more valuable targets may be better secured against crime, it is also possible that offenders would be more likely to offend in less affluent neighbourhoods where targets which would be expected to have less security are more likely to be found.""
  - ""Previous offence locations (for repeat offenders): Because offending in a location will likely either involve gathering information about the area or the targets, these areas are likely to be more familiar, particularly in an offending context, to the offender and so require less effort to reconnaissance and there will be less uncertainty or risk about offending (e.g. Johnson et al., 2009;Bernasco et al., 2015;Lammers et al., 2015; Van Sleeuwen et al., 2018) . Offenders would therefore be expected to be more likely to offend in area if they have offended there previously.""

   - Sampling of alternatives technique, choice set size: 24,594 census blocks

5. Population Information:
   - Population data from U.S. Census, mean age of offenders: 23.9 years, racial composition: 78.4% African American, 15.6% Hispanic, 5.5% White","  - ""The spatial units of analysis are census blocks.""
  - ""In 1996 to 1998, the Chicago Police Department recorded 12,938 cases of robbery incidents in outdoor public locations (street robberies) for which at least one person was arrested who was a Chicago resident.""
  - ""The analysis is limited to cleared robberies because only for cleared robberies offender addresses are available, and distance from the offender home location is by far the most important predictive factor in crime location choice""
  - ""the data include both the location where the offender lived and the location where the robbery was committed.""
  - ""The sample excludes robberies committed by Chicago residents outside their city, but Bernasco et al. (2013) demonstrated that this selection does not produce biased estimates.""
  - ""the conditional logit model was used to estimate the effects of census block attributes on the probability of the census block being selected for robbery.""
  - ""To explore temporal differences in location preference, 12 models were estimated separately for each of 12 two-hour blocks (4-6 a.m., 6-8 a.m., 8-10 a.m., etc.) and 7 models were estimated separately for each of the seven days of the week.""
  - ""To measure small-scale retail activities in the block, we used marketing information collected by Claritas (now part of marketing research firm Nielsen) on businesses in the city of Chicago during the same period the crime data were recorded.""
  - ""To measure the local presence of illegal retail activities, in particular drugs dealing, prostitution, and illegal gambling, geocoded incident files of the Chicago Police Department of the years 1996 to 1998 were aggregated to the census block level.""
  - ""The accessibility of a block was measured by two indicator variables, namely, (13) whether the block is located along at least one main street (rather than only minor streets) and ( 14) whether the block contains a station of the El, the Chicago elevated railway system (also known as ""L"").""
  - ""Data on (15) the presence of private and public high schools in a census block were based on lists compiled by the Chicago Public Schools.""
  - ""Data on block population was obtained from the U.S. 2000 Census.""
  - ""Euclidian distances were calculated between the homes of the offenders and the midpoints of each of the 24,594 census blocks.""
  - ""The distances between offender homes and robbery locations within their own census block of residence was approximated by half the square root of the census block surface, which is about the average distance between two random points in a rectangle of the same size as the block surface""
  - ""to reduce the size of the estimation problem, we used a sampling of alternatives technique (McFadden 1978).""
  - ""The sample sizes were chosen to maximally use the computer's memory resources.""
  - ""The data also include information on the offenders who were arrested for committing these street robberies, including gender, racial and ethnic background, age, and residential address at the time of the robbery.""
  - ""The mean age was 23.9 years (SD ¼ 8.8), 89.7 percent were male, 78.4 percent were African American, 15.6 percent were Hispanic, and 5.5 percent were White.""
  - ""The data did not allow us to identify offenders across multiple robberies.""",,"- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) is identified as ""census blocks,"" with a median size of 19,680 m² (approximately 140 × 140 m).
- The data collection period is from 1996 to 1998.
- The study was conducted in the city of Chicago, USA.
- The type of crime analyzed is street robbery.
- The type of discrete choice model used is the ""conditional logit model.""
- A sampling approach for alternatives was used, specifically a ""sampling of alternatives technique"" to manage the size of the estimation problem.
- Independent variables included in the model are various census block attributes such as the presence of businesses, illegal markets, accessibility features, and demographic information. These were sourced from police records, marketing data, and the U.S. Census.
- Population data per spatial unit was obtained from the U.S. 2000 Census, but specific average or total population per block is not detailed in the quotes.
- The choice of SUoA as census blocks is justified by their use in previous studies and their ability to capture fine-grained spatial data.
- Data sources include police incident reports, marketing research data, and census data.
- Limitations or trade-offs in SUoA selection are not explicitly mentioned, but the choice of census blocks is consistent with prior research and allows for detailed spatial analysis.
- Main findings related to SUoA size or model performance are not explicitly discussed in terms of SUoA size, but the use of census blocks allows for detailed spatial analysis and the conditional logit model facilitates understanding of location choice.","  - ""The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week.""
  - ""The spatial units of analysis are census blocks.""
  - ""Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.""
  - ""the data include both the location where the offender lived and the location where the robbery was committed.""
  - ""The analysis is limited to cleared robberies because only for cleared robberies offender addresses are available, and distance from the offender home location is by far the most important predictive factor in crime location choice""
  - ""To measure small-scale retail activities in the block, we used marketing information collected by Claritas (now part of marketing research firm Nielsen) on businesses in the city of Chicago during the same period the crime data were recorded.""

  - ""The choice for two-hour blocks seemed like a reasonable compromise between the need to use a fine-grained temporal measure on the one hand, and the need for statistical power in modeling and efficiency in presenting results on the other hand.""
  - ""The findings thus confirm that street robbers prefer to attack near cash-intensive businesses and other places that seem to promise high benefits and low risks.""
  - ""High schools are a notable exception, as they appear to be only attractive places for robbery around school hours but not in evenings and nights nor during weekends.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=27 table_on_page=1></table_quotation>""

</table_quotation>""","- The paper provides a detailed list of variables used in the analysis, which are categorized into different types such as demographic, economic, land use, infrastructure, distance/accessibility, and crime opportunity variables.
- Demographic variables include population density and racial/ethnic composition.
- Economic variables include the presence of various businesses like bars, restaurants, liquor stores, and illegal activities.
- Land use variables are represented by the presence of high schools and other businesses.
- Infrastructure variables include accessibility measures like main streets and El stations.
- Distance/accessibility variables are represented by the distance from the offender's home to the crime location.
- Crime opportunity variables are indicated by the presence of illegal activities and cash-intensive businesses.
- The table at the end provides descriptive statistics for these variables, confirming their inclusion in the analysis.","  - ""The spatial units of analysis are census blocks.""
  - ""To measure small-scale retail activities in the block, we used marketing information collected by Claritas (now part of marketing research firm Nielsen) on businesses in the city of Chicago during the same period the crime data were recorded.""
  - ""To measure the local presence of illegal retail activities, in particular drugs dealing, prostitution, and illegal gambling, geocoded incident files of the Chicago Police Department of the years 1996 to 1998 were aggregated to the census block level.""
  - ""The accessibility of a block was measured by two indicator variables, namely, (13) whether the block is located along at least one main street (rather than only minor streets) and ( 14) whether the block contains a station of the El, the Chicago elevated railway system (also known as ""L"").""
  - ""Data on (15) the presence of private and public high schools in a census block were based on lists compiled by the Chicago Public Schools.""
  - ""Data on block population was obtained from the U.S. 2000 Census.""
  - ""Euclidian distances were calculated between the homes of the offenders and the midpoints of each of the 24,594 census blocks.""
  - ""the data include both the location where the offender lived and the location where the robbery was committed.""
  - ""The sample excludes robberies committed by Chicago residents outside their city, but Bernasco et al. (2013) demonstrated that this selection does not produce biased estimates.""
  - ""to reduce the size of the estimation problem, we used a sampling of alternatives technique (McFadden 1978).""
  - ""For each robbery, the chosen census block and a sample of the other 24,593 census blocks were included in the analysis (thereby ignoring information about the census blocks not included in the sample).""
  - ""The sample sizes were chosen to maximally use the computer's memory resources.""
  - ""The analysis is limited to cleared robberies because only for cleared robberies offender addresses are available, and distance from the offender home location is by far the most important predictive factor in crime location choice""
  - ""The data also include information on the offenders who were arrested for committing these street robberies, including gender, racial and ethnic background, age, and residential address at the time of the robbery.""
  - ""The mean age was 23.9 years (SD ¼ 8.8), 89.7 percent were male, 78.4 percent were African American, 15.6 percent were Hispanic, and 5.5 percent were White.""
  - ""The data did not allow us to identify offenders across multiple robberies.""
  - ""In addition, we collected detailed information on land use, population, and activities in all 24,594 census blocks of the city of Chicago in the year 2000.""
  - ""The data further exclude a few street robberies that are perpetrated on expressways (covered by the state police) and robberies on college campuses (covered by the university's police).""

   - **Infrastructure variables:** Accessibility measured by main streets and El stations.
   - **Distance variables:** Euclidean distances between offender homes and census blocks.
   - **Crime opportunity variables:** Presence of illegal activities like drug dealing, prostitution, and gambling.
   - **Social variables:** Not explicitly mentioned.
   - Total variables in final model: 18 (as mentioned in the paper).

- The study does not mention the population per spatial unit, focusing instead on the characteristics of the street segments.
- The choice of SUoA as street segments is justified by their ability to capture relevant environmental features and their alignment with recent research advocating for small spatial units of analysis.
- Data sources used include interviews with drug dealers and systematic observations of street segments.
- Limitations mentioned include the coarseness of street segments as units of analysis and the variability of their characteristics over time, suggesting that even smaller units might be more appropriate for future research.

  - ""We combine data from prestructured interview questions, narrative data from semi-structured open-ended interview questions, and data collected through systematic street-level observations.""
  - ""The first factor is labeled potential customer density. It is measured by the number of potential customer attractors, the activity level, and the accessibility of the location.""
  - ""The second factor is labeled social control. Social control is measured by the presence of formal and informal agents of social control (people who are likely to intervene in dealing when they notice it, for example, residents, police offenders, or shop managers), by territoriality and by the absence of social disorder.""
  - ""We distinguish three sets of indicators that affect potential customer density, that is, opportunities to meet potential customers.""
  - ""We also distinguish three sets of indicators for social control, which refers to the potential of other people to interfere with drug dealing.""
  - ""Table 1 displays the hypothesized relations of these six indicators with the location choices for soliciting customers and selling them drugs.""
  - ""The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control.""
  - ""The city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, had a population of 780,500 in 2011""
  - ""The 1012 postal code includes as a subarea the Amsterdam Red Light District (""De Wallen""), a network of small streets and alleys with a heavy concentration of legal indoors prostitution services, totaling approximately 370 ""windows"" where prostitutes openly advertise their services.""
  - ""The overall study sample consisted of 50 subjects who were active as dealers in downtown Amsterdam.""
  - ""The interviews with dealers combined highly structured lists of fixed-choice items with an open-ended interview protocol.""
  - ""A subset of 31 of the 50 subjects completed a supplement to the interview that specifically dealt with spatial aspects of selling drugs in downtown Amsterdam.""
  - ""To measure characteristics of the physical and social environment in which the subjects recruited customers and sold drugs to them, we made systematic observations throughout the study area, as mapped in Figure 1""
  - ""Systematic observation requires that the area be partitioned into spatial units. In line with recent work that advocates the use of small spatial units of analysis (Oberwittler & Wikström, 2009;Weisburd, Groff, & Yang, 2012) and translating it into practical guidelines, 262 street segments were identified in the study area, of which 49 are located in the Red Light District.""
  - ""A scoring instrument containing 36 items was constructed to measure a range of tangible characteristics of each of the 262 street segments.""
  - ""The descriptive statistics of the 36 measures are presented in Table 2 , together with the descriptive statistics of the street segment length.""
  - ""The observation of a single street segment took 15 minutes on average.""
  - ""The inter-observer reliability was evaluated by calculating measures of association between the two observations of a single segment, that is, Pearson's product-moment correlation for continuous variables and Spearman's ρ for rank-ordered variables.""
  - ""The quantitative findings demonstrate that the dealers who were interviewed displayed a tendency to solicit at locations where potential customers congregate but did not seem to be deterred by the police or other sources of social control.""
  - ""The results of the qualitative analysis provide additional insights into the effects of formal social control on location choices.""
  - ""The results of our analysis of the interview transcripts demonstrate that street segments are still too coarse as units of analysis, not only because they still cover too large territory but also because their relevant characteristics are not stable over time.""
  - ""the analysis of the interview transcripts underlines that although some of our measured street segments' characteristics are static (e.g., the presence of facilities), others are not.""
  - ""The conclusion to be drawn from this observation could be, as we suggest, that future research should study offending at even smaller spatial units of analysis than street segments (e.g., 10 × 10 m grids, or even addresses).""","  - ""(Page 18, Table 1) | Variablea                                      | (1) Recruitment | (2) Latest solicit | (3) Take customer | (4) Latest sale |

- Potential customer density is measured by the presence of retail and entertainment businesses, accessibility (connecting streets, parking, public transport), and activity level (pedestrian, bike, car flow).
- Social control is measured by the presence of agents of social control (CCTV cameras, police officers), territoriality (objects signaling non-public areas), and physical disorder (signs of neglect).
- The tables provide detailed lists of variables, including specific types of businesses (coffeeshops, bars, liquor stores), infrastructure (alleyways, public parking), and social control indicators (police CCTV cameras, police officers).
- The paper also mentions variables related to the physical environment and accessibility, such as segment length, presence of hotels and hostels, and public toilets.
- The tables at the end of the paper provide a comprehensive list of these variables with their corresponding units and descriptive statistics.","  - ""The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crime-illicit drug dealing in an open air drug market-and tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands.""

   - Note: Variables from 2009

4. Sampling Strategy Details:
   - Case-control design
   - 300 single houses (150 burglarized, 150 non-burglarized)
   - Grouped by neighborhood

5. Population Information:
   - Not mentioned","  - ""Collecting fresh, micro-level data using Google Street View (GSV) as a tool of Systematic Social Observation (SSO), we utilise a case-control design to isolate property-level effects.""
  - ""Analysis is carried out using conditional logistic regression.""
  - ""The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""For this study, a selection of 150 dwellings that were burglarised during daylight hours in 2009 is made from geocoded, timestamped data from The Hague Police Force, the Netherlands.""
  - ""The physical characteristics of these residential units and their immediate surrounding area are measured through Systematic Social Observation (SSO), using Google Maps and its built-in virtual reality tool, Google Street View (GSV).2""
  - ""The non-burglarised control group consists of a further 155 residential homes randomly sampled from the BAG single houses dataset.""
  - ""the final sample used for analysis therefore consisted of 300 single houses, evenly split between burglarised and non-burglarised dwellings.""
  - ""The items collected using SSO were selected for the purposes of objectively measuring the four principle concepts deemed particularly prominent in offender-based research.""
  - ""Property surveillability was measured by three items, namely (1) the number of windows from neighbouring residential units with a direct view of the front ground floor, (2) the distance between the property and the building on the other side of the street, and (3) the visibility of the front door from the street.""
  - ""Property accessibility was measured through seven items, namely (1) whether the property was at the end of a row of properties, (2) number of boundaries the property shared with public areas, (3) whether the private space of the property could be sealed off with physical barriers, (4) whether the property has a burglar alarm, (5) whether the property was setback from the street, (6) the age of the building and ( 7) whether the property had amenities, such as plant pots and benches, on public space directly outside the unit.""
  - ""Wealth was measured with three items, namely (1) whether the property had a garage, (2) the size of the property in square metres, and (3) the external condition of the property.""
  - ""Ease of escape was measured with three items, namely (1) the distance between the property and the nearest main road, (2) the distance between the property and the nearest street corner, and (3) the number of escape routes, including footpaths, leading off the street segment.""
  - ""Three variables were used as control variables. One binary variable indicated whether there was a business present in the immediate surrounding area open during daylight hours: we aimed to control for the 'eyes on the street' that nearby businesses might generate.""
  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""
  - ""The results from this study indicate that the behaviour of burglars out on the street does, on the whole, concur with the claims by participants in experimental scenarios or interviews in previous research.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=6 table_on_page=1>```markdown

- The study measures property surveillability, accessibility, wealth, and ease of escape.
- Surveillability is measured by the number of windows with a direct view, distance to neighboring buildings, and front door visibility.
- Accessibility is measured by whether the property is at the end of a row, number of public boundaries, presence of physical barriers, burglar alarm, setback from the street, building age, and public amenities.
- Wealth is measured by the presence of a garage, property size, and external condition.
- Ease of escape is measured by distance to main roads, street corners, and number of escape routes.
- Control variables include business presence, mixed land-use, and house type.
- Neighbourhood-level data is sourced from a community survey.
