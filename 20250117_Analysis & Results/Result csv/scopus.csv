Fentanyl analogs with similar structures are difficult to distinguish due to their fragmentation patterns, making separation using chromatography essential. Additionally, because fentanyl analogs are lethal even in trace amounts, they are easily smuggled, and commonly used fentanyl test strips often fail to detect them due to their low sensitivity. Therefore, the urgent need for analytical methods that can simultaneously identify multiple analogs and swiftly detect them at low concentrations. Results: In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was conducted to screen 93 types of fentanyl analogs among the illegal fentanyl substances. The phenyl-hexyl columns enhance fentanyl analog separation through strong π–π interactions. The serially coupled column system increased the separation efficiency and mitigated peak distortion, particularly those of polar fentanyl analogs. The selectivity varied significantly, depending on the interactions with the combined columns. The phenyl-hexyl column's superior ability to predict fentanyl analog interactions based on molecular structure was confirmed by retention factor analysis. The resolution of fentanyl isomers increased significantly when methanol was used instead of acetonitrile as an organic modifier in the mobile phase. The approach was validated by determining the limits of detection and quantification, specificity, detection capability, recovery, and relative ion intensity. Significance: The fentanyl analogs, including 23 sets of isomeric and isobaric compounds, were analyzed via separation using a phenyl-hexyl column serially coupled with a cyano column. The serially coupled column system increased the separation efficiency and mitigated peak distortion, particularly those of polar fentanyl analogs. The proposed strategy can be adopted in exploring methods of effectively separating mixtures with diverse properties, aiding the prevention of drug abuse and bolstering public health and safety efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Fentanyl analogs; Liquid chromatography (LC); Mass spectrometry (MS); Serially coupled columns; π–π interactions","Column chromatography; Crime; Drug interactions; Liquid chromatography; 93 fentanyl analogs; fentanyl; unclassified drug; Column systems; Fentanyl analogs; Fentanyls; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Rapid separation; Separation efficiency; Serially coupled columns; Synthesis method; π-π interaction; Article; calibration; chromatography; flow rate; fragmentation reaction; isobaric labeling; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; measurement repeatability; multiple reaction monitoring; prediction; qualitative analysis; rapid separation; tandem mass spectrometry; validation process; Isomers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210354931"

Preliminary studies showed that sexual violence committed by solo offenders is different from that of duos or groups of offenders. This study explores the heterogeneity within 983 cases of sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators, with a focus not only on offenders’ modus operandi, but also victims’ routine activities and situational aspects of the crime. Results from a latent class analysis identified four offending patterns: sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators where: 1) stranger victims were randomly selected; 2) offenders were geographically mobile; 3) victims were assaulted during social events; and 4) offenders were non-sexually motivated. Findings help identify situational characteristics interacting with offenders’ behaviors and victims’ routine activities associated with sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators. The implications regarding the heterogeneity of criminal patterns in these forms of violence is discussed in relation to police practice, situational crime prevention strategies, and future research. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","group rape; multiple perpetrator sexual offending; multiple perpetrator sexual offenses; multiple perpetrators; Sexual violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170664741"

Previous studies have identified certain relationships between drinking behaviors and environmental factors, with limited consideration of the dynamic geographic context and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of these relationships. This study constructs a theoretical framework for the relationships between excessive drinking and geographical environment factors (i.e., alcohol availability, spatial disorder, and social disorder). Using multisource spatiotemporal data, including the alcoholism cases received by Guangzhou Emergency Medical Command Center and mobile signaling data, the study explores the spatiotemporal patterns and the influencing factors of excessive drinking in a dynamic geographic context. Results show that: (1) Excessive drinking events mostly occur on weekends, at night, and in urban commercial centers. Its spatial distribution is balanced in the daytime but congregated in the nighttime; (2) Excessive drinking is influenced by alcohol availability (positively correlated with the density of KTVs and traffic stations). The positive impact of KTVs is prominent in the old urban area in the daytime and is prominent in more areas in the nighttime. The positive impact of traffic stations is mainly observed at the edge of central urban area and in suburban areas, and is relatively stronger in the daytime; (3) Excessive drinking is also affected by certain spatial disorder factors (positively correlated with the land development level), but has no significant relationship with building age and streetscape messiness. The positive impact of land development level is prominent in the new urban scenic core area and the urban villages at the urban-rural fringe, with a stronger impact in the daytime; (4) The relationship between excessive drinking and social disorder shows greater spatiotemporal differentiation and complexity. Overall, excessive drinking is negatively correlated with the proportion of nonlocal-born population, and positively correlated with the proportion of low-educated population and residential rent; (5) By analyzing different leading factors influencing excessive drinking in the daytime or nighttime, four types of spatial units can be identified, allowing for respective interventions in these zones to reduce the risk of excessive drinking. This study reveals the relationships between excessive drinking and geographical environment in a dynamic geographic context and at a smaller spatial scale, which fills the gap of lacking smaller-scale analysis, spatiotemporal heterogeneity perspective, and consideration of dynamic geographic context in previous studies. Our results provide insights for alcohol policy making, regional security and medical resource allocation, spatial planning, and environmental intervention related to health issues. © 2024 Science Press.

The overview of rational choice theory emphasizes the works of Ronald Clarke and Derek Cornish in applying the concept of rational decision making to criminal offending decisions. Here, the assumptions about rational choice, involvement decisions, event decisions, repeat offending, and applications for crime prevention are reviewed. Routine activities theory is also discussed as a theory of crime prevention, highlighting the importance of macro-level routine activities as introduced by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson, routine activities at the micro-level, and finally, applications of the theory for crime prevention. © 2025 Billy Henson, Bradford W.

Methods: In an online field experiment, we created 176 honey Gmail accounts and randomly assigned them to eight different posts containing account credential leaks. We used a 2 × 2 experimental design, manipulating two key variables within the post titles: the number of accounts (5 K or 1.5 M) and the promise of access to additional platforms (absent or present). We then monitored the accounts for any subsequent activity. Results: Our findings indicate that the promise of access to additional platforms increased the likelihood and speed of an attempted access. Only 12 accounts were fully accessed, however, because most hijackers did not complete the second-factor authentication (2FA) process required for gaining full access. It seems that the 2FA acted as a deterrent to complete Gmail account hijacking. Conclusions: The study aligns with the rational choice perspective of crime, showing that the prospect of greater rewards leads to more attempted account accesses.

This space comprises risk disposition, considered in terms of bounded risk aversion and adaptive responsiveness and a generalized susceptibility acquisition. We show that resultant geospatial contagion configurations follow intricate Turing patterns observed in reaction–diffusion systems. Pattern formation is shown to be highly sensitive to changes in underlying vulnerability parameters. The identified critical regimes (tipping points) imply that slight changes in susceptibility acquisition and perceived local risks can significantly alter the population flow and resultant contagion patterns. We examine several case studies using Australian datasets (COVID-19 pandemic; crime incidence; conflict exposure during COVID-19 protests; real estate businesses and residential building approvals) and demonstrate that these spatial contagions generated Turing patterns in accordance with the proposed model. © 2024 The Authors.","epidemics; opinion polarization; pattern formation; social myths; socio-economic turbulence; susceptibility acquisition","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206282841"

Objective: The aim of this study was to describe demographics, care-seeking patterns and factors influencing timely care-seeking by survivors of sexual violence. Methods: Retrospective file-based data analysis of sexual violence survivors accessing care within two Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) programmes supporting the Ministry of Health, in North Kivu, DRC, 2014–2018. Results: Most survivors (66%) sought care at specialised sexual violence clinics and a majority of the survivors were self-referred (51%). Most survivors seeking care (70%) did so within 3 days. Male survivors accessing care were significantly more likely to seek care within 3 days compared to females. All age groups under 50 years old were more likely to seek care within 3 days compared to those aged 50 years and older. Being referred by the community, a family member, mobile clinic or authorities was significantly associated with less probability of seeking care within 3 days compared to being self-referred. Conclusion: Access to timely health care for survivors of sexual violence in North Kivu, DRC, is challenging and varies between different groups of survivors. Providers responding to survivors of sexual violence need to adapt models of care and awareness raising strategies to ensure that programmes are developed to enable timely access to care for all survivors. More research is needed to further understand the barriers and enablers to access timely care for different groups of survivors. © 2024 The Author(s).

Focusing on crimes, this study first detected emerging clusters of four types of crime (larceny, auto theft, burglary, and robbery) in Atlanta using space-time permutation scan statistics. We then investigated how the spatiotemporal patterns of these clusters changed during the pandemic (2020) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2019). Finally, we classified the detected clusters based on their duration and radius. Our results show that burglary clusters became shorter and smaller during the pandemic. The average duration and radius of statistically significant burglary clusters were 10.75 days and 0.79 km for 2019, but 6.86 days and 0.45 km for 2020, respectively. In contrast, we observed more larceny clusters that were temporally longer and spatially larger during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The duration and radius of statistically significant larceny clusters were 17.67 days and 0.46 km for 2019 and 23.22 days and 0.75 km for 2020, respectively. Furthermore, we noted a shift in the clusters from residential areas to commercial areas. We however detected a very limited number of auto theft and robbery clusters.

Due to the resource constrained nature of IoT networks, conventional security methods are not always suitable. Therefore, physical layer security (PLS) has come to the forefront, providing a high level of security while respecting the limited resources of IoTs. A Sybil attack is an insider attack in which a malicious node illegitimately fakes multiple identities, to impersonate legitimate nodes in the IoT network. This study introduces a novel Sybil attack detection scheme for mobile IoT networks that corresponds to time-varying channel. doppler-shift caused by mobile IoT nodes is considered as a novel detection metric to identify available Sybil attacks. The proposed scheme is analyzed by both the true positive rate and the false positive rate, which are mathematically formulated to verify the simulation results. Results demonstrate that as the randomness in the mobility pattern of IoT nodes increases, the proposed detection mechanism based on doppler-shift offers improved identification of the Sybil nodes. Moreover, this work provides receiver operating characteristics (RoCs) for mobile IoT networks to evaluate the effect of different system parameters, including carrier frequency, velocity, subcarrier spacing (SCS), and the size of cyclic prefix (CP). The performance of the proposed scheme improves with an increase in both the carrier frequency and velocity, as the doppler-shift becomes more pronounced.  © 2014 IEEE.","doppler-shift; malicious node; mobile Internet of Things (IoT) networks; novel detection model; Sybil attack","Computer crime; Internet of things; Network layers; Network security; Sensor nodes; Attack detection; Detection models; Malicious nodes; Mobile Internet; Mobile internet of thing network; Novel detection model; Observer; Security; Sybil attack; Wireless communications; Doppler effect","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162894215"

We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime.

Unfortunately, the gender-specific needs and demands of women are often ignored while designing transportation settings, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, transit fear and victimization have become prevalent in such fragile transport systems. This study aims to shed light on the close association between transit fear, victimization, and the inadequacies of transportation systems. It also explores how these issues have been addressed in academic discourse over time. The study employs a combination of ‘narrative review’ and ‘systematic review’, commonly known as a ‘semi-systematic review’ process. To achieve its objectives, the study reviewed 88 papers, including relevant grey literature for narrative analysis, and conducted different themes and keywords analyses on 116 Scopus-indexed papers for a comprehensive systematic review. However, in the context of developing countries, the Scopus database reveals a scarcity of empirical studies that focus on women’s victimization during transit and gendered transport environment settings. This leads to a significant disparity in recognizing transit victimization, implementing effective mitigation measures, and understanding the patterns of reporting harassment varying substantially between developed and developing nations. While the narrative review provides detailed observations, the bibliometric analysis adds new insights and strengthens the understanding of the narrative review from different perspectives. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Fear of victimization; Physical assaults; Public transportation; Transport environment settings; Urban; Women’s mobility","Crime; Mass transportation; Urban transportation; Fear of victimization; Physical assault; Public transportation; Systematic Review; Transport environment; Transport environment setting; Transportation system; Urban; Victimisation; Woman’s mobility; Developing countries","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187706844"

However, the microphone may be spitefully invoked by malicious mobile applications(apps) with arousing security and privacy concerns. In this work, to explore the issue of illegal microphone access, we develop spiteful apps through native and injection development to access the microphone viciously on a series of mobile devices. The results demonstrate that baleful apps could enable the microphone arbitrarily without any hint. To combat the unauthorized microphone access behavior, we design a microphone illegal access detection(MicDet) scheme by constructing a request-response time model using the Unix time stamps of voice icon touched and microphone invoked. Through conducting numerical analysis and hypothesis testing to effectively verify the request-response pattern of app's normal access, we detect illegal access by analyzing whether the touch operation matches the normal pattern. For friendly user experience, we design an intuitive floating window to alert users by displaying the name of the app that illegally accessed the microphone once the illegal behavior is detected. Finally, we apply our scheme to different mobile devices and test several apps, the experimental results show that the MicDet scheme achieves a high detection accuracy.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Eavesdropping attack detection; microphone access; mobile applications; mobile devices","Behavioral research; Crime; Microphones; Mobile security; Smartphones; Attack detection; Behavioral science; Eavesdropping attack detection; Eavesdropping attacks; Illegal Access; Microphone access; Mobile applications; Operating system; Security; Smart phones; Mobile computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141606304"

This research analyzes the spatial and temporal patterns of drugs and alcohol-related illegal activities (DARIA) in Siliguri, known as the “Gateway of North-East India.” The primary objectives are to explore DARIA patterns, identify clusters and concentrated areas, and investigate contributing factors. Using GIS-based spatial analysis and geographical models, we studied incidents recorded over three years from 2021 to 2023. Advanced spatial statistical approaches were applied to identify specific clusters of DARIA occurrences. The pure temporal analysis highlighted periods of increased illegal activity. Various geographical models, including ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), were used to examine the spatial association. The MGWR model, with an explanatory power of R2 = 0.816, provided a detailed understanding of spatial relationships and variations in DARIA. Our findings indicate specific zones with frequent DARIA occurrences, mainly near major transportation hubs, commercial points, and areas with significant mobility. Key exploratory factors such as illiteracy rate, population density, proximity to playgrounds and slums were highly associated with DARIA incidents.

Here, we examine if, through their impact on people’s on- and off-line activities, COVID-19 restriction affected fraud committed on- and off-line during the pandemic. Our expectation was that levels of online offending would closely follow changes to mobility and online activity—with crime increasing as restrictions were imposed (and online activity increased) and declining as they were relaxed. For doorstep fraud, which has a different opportunity structure, our expectation was that the reverse would be true. Method: COVID-19 restrictions systematically disrupted people’s activity patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions well-suited to testing the effects of “interventions” on crime. We exploit those conditions using ARIMA time series models and UK data for online shopping fraud, hacking, doorstep fraud, online sales, and mobility to test hypotheses. Doorstep fraud is modelled as a non-equivalent dependent variable, allowing us to test whether findings were selective and in line with theoretical expectations. Results: After controlling for other factors, levels of crime committed online were positively associated with monthly variation in online activities and negatively associated with monthly variation in mobility. In contrast, and as expected, monthly variation in doorstep fraud was positively associated with changes in mobility. Conclusions: We find evidence consistent with routine activity theory, suggesting that disruptions to people’s daily activity patterns affect levels of crime committed both on- and off-line. The theoretical implications of the findings, and the need to develop a better evidence base about what works to reduce online crime, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.","COVID-19; Doorstep fraud; Online fraud; Online hacking; Routine activity theory","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143656378"

However, the spatial boundaries are often considered places with inadequate regulation, unclear allocation of responsibilities, and lack of street surveillance for residents, all of which promote crime breeding. In existing studies, the boundary variables being considered are inadequate, and the lack of temporal analysis leads to insufficient precision of results to effectively guide relevant urban management. Therefore, this study explored the temporalspatial distribution pattern of larceny at multiple types of boundaries. The study used negative binomial regression to explore the temporal variation of each boundary’s impact on larceny. Results show that urban village boundaries need to be supervised more at night, whereas town boundaries should mainly be patrolled more during the day. In addition, to some extent, their temporal divergence of impact reflects the impact of security supervision and the mobility and heterogeneity of community residents on crime at each period.

Using the deep learning algorithm of image regression, we analyzed the level of fear of crime under different streetscape environments on a large scale in the central urban area of Beijing. This approach compensates for the limitations of social surveys in terms of spatial coverage, spatial resolution, and reliability and validity of measures. Our indigenous deep learning models also make up for the lack of established models that rely on western city street view images and overseas labelers. Our study shows that, first, the spatial pattern of fear of crime has a circular, multi-cluster, and radial structure, and its level gradually increases from the city center to the suburbs. In contrast, the density/ number of theft and violent crimes have the spatial distribution with the opposite trend. Second, according to the relationship between the spatial distribution of fear of crime and criminal activities in general, we find a low match between subjective and objective security in the city center, with the objective situation being more dangerous than the subjective perception; in the suburban areas, the degree of match between the two increases; to the outer suburbs, these two still have a low degree of match, but the objective situation is safer than the subjective perception. Third, the built and social environmental factors that influence subjective and objective security are not always identical. A high-density and highly mixed environment would reduce fear of crime, but may accelerate crime. To reduce both fear and crime, it is recommended to add cul-de-sacs, improve the sense of enclosure, increase the amount of greenery, and eliminate various types of physical disorder. As for the effect of social disorganization, concentrated disadvantaged communities tend to have high levels of fear and are more prone to violent crime; population mobility can help reduce fear of crime; residential heterogeneity would exacerbate criminal behavior. Our findings help to clarify the differential explanatory power of classical crime geography theory for subjective and objective security, which in turn facilitates a comprehensive assessment of the security consequences of environmental intervention policies. © 2024, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

Furthermore, the evolution and enhancement of big data technologies have significantly contributed to enhancing the rationality and efficacy of various distribution network planning and layout approaches. At the same time, multi-distribution networks have also confronted numerous network attacks with increasing probability and severity. In this study, a Petri net is initially employed as a modeling technique to delineate the network attack flow within the distribution network. Subsequently, the data from prior network attacks are consolidated and scrutinized to evaluate the vulnerability of the cyber-physical system (CPS), thereby identifying the most critical network attack pattern for a multi-component distribution network. Following this, the defender–attacker–defender planning methodology is applied for scale modeling, incorporating rapidly evolving mobile energy storage into the pre-layout, aiming to mitigate the detrimental impact of network attacks on the power grid. Ultimately, the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is utilized to simulate and validate the proposed planning strategy in a 33-node system with multiple control groups established to demonstrate the viability and merits of the proposed strategy.

The hypothesis was made that mobility fluxes may undermine social control mechanisms by altering the socio-demographic composition of urban populations, therefore increasing the risk of crime victimization. The analysis brought together indicators of land use and a measure of the ambient population disaggregated by different profiles of public space users (by sex, age, and place of residence). The results indicate that robbery and theft tend to cluster around locations that attract a higher proportion of non-residents (i.e. national and international visitors). Non-local visitors, who visit the city occasionally or once in a lifetime, lack a comprehensive knowledge of the environment which would help them to navigate safely through the urban space. Therefore, their presence not only unsettles the social routines of public spaces in Barcelona but also reflects negatively in terms of crime occurrence. This finding raises questions about how to accommodate growing mobilities in our cities without detriment to incumbent residents and their safety, which seems to be critical in post-COVID-19 urban planning. © The Author(s) 2024.","Ambient population; mobility; outdoor crime; routines; social disorganization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194576397"

Cognitive intelligence in cybersecurity includes understanding the prospect of protection of digital devices, computer networks, websites, and cloud computing from both external and internal threats. Cyber threats like phishing, smishing, and data theft cause threats to business processes. In today’s day and age mobile, social networking and IoT are generating huge amounts of data. Analysis of the large volume of data helps in identifying the different attack vectors and their behavior pattern. It further can exceed the cognitive skills of security systems, rules, and protocols in organizations to keep the system more secure. Security analysts are now gathering huge amounts of data on users, networks, and transaction details. The captured data may reveal weak spots, hidden patterns, or disguised malicious activities. Evaluating and contemplating the underlying meaning of data is time-consuming and can be missed easily. In this paper, we are suggesting a few machine learning-based approaches to find the correlation between the data.

This work demonstrates a novel technique to monitor criminals in a restricted-access building via radio sensing. The sensing is performed on the latest commercial WiFi device. Accordingly, the data are discretely collected at several common positions to build baseline signal patterns. Next, we propose a few-shot learning model to train on a limited dataset. The testing results show that our system can recognize the mobility of a criminal behind the door, even with sparse training data.

With the support of mobile phone big data, this study constructs an index of ambient population heterogeneity to represent the complexity of the social environment. After controlling for the effects of total ambient population, nonlocal rate, transportation accessibility, crime attractors, and crime generators, this study employs a negative binomial regression model to examine the influence of ambient population heterogeneity and different income groups on the spatial manifestations of thefts. The findings indicate that ambient population heterogeneity significantly escalates the incidence of thefts, with middle and upper-middle-income groups acting as more attractive targets, whereas the higher-income group exerts a deterrent effect. The interaction analysis shows that increased population heterogeneity contributes to social disorder, thereby amplifying the attractiveness of the ambient population to perpetrators. These conclusions highlight the crucial role of ambient population heterogeneity in explaining crime dynamics and therefore enrich the routine activity theory. © 2024, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182395826"

This study examines municipal police force size as a potential driver of these disparate mobility patterns. Although a larger police force may enhance mobility outcomes for all low-income children through reducing exposure to crime, for Black males prior work suggests this will be offset by the disparate negative impact of increased contact with the criminal justice system. Analyzing a sample of 200 major U.S. cities, linear models find a positive association between the number of police officers per capita and the size of the racial mobility gap for males, but not for females. We go on to show more police personnel in the late 1990s is associated with an increased gap in the likelihood of incarceration for Black males relative to White males. Taken together, our findings point to the heterogeneous impacts of policing for different race-sex groups as one potential explanation for why we observe a racial mobility gap between Black and White males and why this gap is larger in some cities and smaller in others. © 2024 The Authors","Economic mobility; Police; Racial inequality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203087856"

The advantages of iris scanning are that these structures do not change over time, and surgery cannot also modify the characteristics and appearance of their pattern.

As contextualized at the beginning of this chapter, such a behavioural perspective is rooted in so-called “Processual Archaeology”, which we imply as the starting point of our approach, devoted to deciphering vernacular choreographies casting the everyday life of early humans. Here, we use settlement locales on the Crimea peninsula in order to describe three scales of human mobility. All sites were occupied by the last Neanderthal humans, about 45,000 years ago. At a small scale, we reconstruct recipes of stone tool production with gestures of human arms, hands, and fingers, all within the kinesphere or kinaesthetic bodily space of an individual Neanderthal. The embodied performances of knapping are considered “body techniques” in the sense of Marcel Mauss. Two more scales are then dealt with in lesser detail: at an intermediate scale, a small campsite is considered as a choreographic “stage” for movements of the human body, walking, standing, and sitting down, all related to disassembling three animals hunted nearby and brought to the dwelling place. At a large scale, we compare a cluster of settlement sites that supposedly belonged to the same, seasonally geared mobility system, thus describing an annual itinerary of humans through their landscape. As a result, we envisage the option of understanding artefacts and objects as expressions of an ancient practice, geared by vernacular choreography. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Body techniques; chaîne opératoire; Post-processualism; Practice theory; Processualism; Stone tool making","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188894095"

Whereas in historiography the presence of franc-tireurs, the new industrial warfare or the specific military and radicalised command culture of individual armies often served as explanatory patterns for the escalation of violence, this contribution attempts to introduce a different perspective into the discussion. The focus is on the specific violence of mobile warfare, which was articulated in the context of military “forward panics” (Randall Collins) on the Eastern and Balkan fronts and was responsible for a considerable part of the war crimes committed there. The article therefore deals with the nature and character of these military forward panics. Starting with a description of the spatial characteristics of the front as a specific space of violence, the role of military orders and the significance of the front as a soldierly space of imagination, the article analyses above all the structural violence of forward panics. In this context, the article discusses three factors that played an essential role in this escalation process: first, the special soldierly frame of reference of combat in mobile warfare, which continuously lowered the inhibition thresholds for the escalation of violence; second, the escalation-forcing dynamics that the swift advance or the flight-like retreat of the troops brought with it for the process of violence; and finally, third, the significance of soldierly group pressure for the process of escalation of violence. © The Author(s), 2023.

IoV allows vehicles to connect and exchange information with each other and other smart devices contributing in shaping smart cities. IoV enables real-time data exchange between vehicles and traffic management systems. By collecting and analysing data on traffic flow, congestion, and road conditions, cities can optimize traffic signal timings, dynamically reroute vehicles, and provide drivers with real-time traffic updates. This improves traffic efficiency, reduces congestion, and enhances overall transportation systems. However, there is a risk that malicious vehicles may provide false information and interfere, or in the worst-case scenario, cause chaos on the roads. In order to address this issue, we propose a Blockchain-enabled intrusion detection system (BIDS) for the IoV network, in which vehicles share their mobility patterns with the traffic management system. BIDS formulates the mobility pattern of the vehicles in the form of blocks that are changed together. The blocks are validated and confirmed as the vehicle reaches the next location as claimed. Otherwise, the following blocks will become invalid and obviously will not be considered in the traffic management system. Our simulations show that the BIDS method can detect up to 98% of malicious vehicles when only 5% of the vehicles are malicious, and up to 85% when 40% of the vehicles are malicious. © 2018 IEEE.","","Advanced traffic management systems; Blockchain; Computer crime; Electronic data interchange; Information management; Intrusion detection; Real time systems; Risk perception; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Traffic signals; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Block-chain; Flow condition; Information and Communication Technologies; Intrusion Detection Systems; Mobility pattern; Real-time data exchange; Smart devices; Traffic flow; Traffic management systems; Vehicle management systems; Vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193924179"

We analysed the distribution of robbery and theft in Barcelona, Spain, as a testing application. Crime data were aggregated to nonoverlapping units (census tracts) and to a new measure of overlapping neighbourhoods, that we named ‘walkhoods’, accounting for the distance that can be covered in 5 min at a walking speed of 1 m/s, considering all possible physical barriers. The outcomes of regression models shed new light on the relationship between mobility and crime. When the walkhood scale is established, human mobility patterns have a stronger effect on the outcome variables than when census tracts are used. Results point to walkability constraints and social distances imposed by the massive presence of sporadic users in public spaces as strong predictors of crime occurrence, arguably due to their negative effects on neighbourhood social ties formation. Our findings suggest that more flexible definitions of the neighbourhood could address the social and spatial heterogeneity of urban spaces more properly than traditional approaches. © 2024 The Authors","Bespoke neighbourhood; Crime; Human mobility; Spatial dependence; Walkability","Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; data set; mobility; neighborhood; urban design; urban development; walking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184070582"

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem serves as the technological backbone for VRCS by enabling seamless communication and data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management centers. This enables real-time, high-speed communication, efficient data processing, and enhanced security, fostering the development of autonomous driving, smart traffic management, and seamless connectivity within the VRCS ecosystem. At the same time, cyber attacks have become more complex, persistent, organized, and weaponized in IoV network. Threat intelligence (TI) has emerged as a prominent security approach to obtain a complete view of the dynamically growing cyber threat environment. On the other hand, modeling TI is a challenging task due to the limited labels available for different cyber threat sources. Second, most of the available designs require a large investment of resources and use handcrafted features, making the entire process error-prone and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, this article presents TIMIF, a deep-learning-based TI modeling and identification framework for intelligent IoV and is based on three key modules: first, the proposed TIMIF adopts an automated pattern extractor (APE) module to extract hidden patterns from IoV networks. Employing its output, we design a TI-based detection (TIBD) module to detect abnormal behavior and TI-attack type identification (TIATI) module to identify attack types. Extensive experiments are carried out on three different publicly intrusion data sources, namely, HCRL-car hacking, ToN-IoT, and CICIDS-2017 to illustrate the utility of the TIMIF framework over some commonly used baselines and state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 IEEE.","Cyber threats; deep learning (DL); Internet of Vehicles (IoV); threat intelligence (TI); vehicle-road cooperation systems (VRCSs)","5G mobile communication systems; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Electronic data interchange; Information management; Investments; Personal computing; Roads and streets; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Biological system modeling; Cyber threats; Deep learning; Internet of vehicle; Security; Soft sensors; Threat intelligence; Threat modeling; Vehicle network; Vehicle road cooperation system; Network security","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192999647"

While recent studies have identified similar patterns in ideologically motivated violence, variation in the travel behaviors of extremists remains underexplored. Using data on right-wing extremists who carried out a violent plot, between 2000 and 2020, alongside information on Capitol insurrectionist arrestees–and drawing on routine activity and rational-choice theories of offender decision-making–this study extends this literature along three dimensions: type, time, and ties. First, we distinguish between different types of offenders, showing that while both violent extremists and insurrectionists exhibit distance-decays, the latter tend to travel farther and exhibit a more irregular decay. Secondly, we identify a meaningful temporal shift in the right-wing extremist landscape, with offenders increasingly traveling longer distances to execute their plots. Finally, we highlight the role of social ties in shaping travel behaviors, where individuals affiliated with extremist groups tend to travel longer distances.

This paper demonstrates the importance of data visualization as a means of conducting initial assessments of testable datasets to validate their suitability and promptly detect unexpected patterns before delving deeper into investigations. Using the publicly available PAYSIM dataset as a case study, we analyzed 6,362,620 records, of which 8213 were fraudulent and the remainder were legitimate. The dataset comprised 9 features and a single target class. Our analysis reveals the powerful role of visualization in identifying early indications of incompatibility with the dataset and guiding analysts to question its fitness for the context at hand. In particular, we show how visualization can highlight key findings and provide an added emphasis to the results. Through visual and numerical analysis, we demonstrate the importance of identifying potential outliers and other anomalies before proceeding with data preprocessing and modeling. Our results suggest that visual analysis of data is an essential step in detecting fraudulent activities in mobile money transactions. This approach can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems, thereby protecting users from financial losses. We conclude that data visualization should be an integral part of any data analysis project, especially in the field of fraud detection, to ensure the validity and suitability of the data before proceeding with further investigations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Electronic Crimes; Fraud detection; Mobile money fraud; Visualization","Crime; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Electronic money; Information analysis; Losses; Case-studies; Data analysis techniques; Data preprocessing; Decisions makings; Electronic crime; Fraud detection; Initial assessment; Mobile money fraud; Target class; Visualization technique; Visualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165132255"

According to routine activity theory, these could affect the rate and nature of crime. This has largely been examined with volume crime (e.g., burglary, robbery) or crimes committed in the home. Stranger sex offenses greatly vary in nature and occur in a range of settings; therefore, these offenses present a novel opportunity to investigate different routine activity theory-based hypotheses. Method: The National Crime Agency routinely collects detailed information about all stranger sex offenses reported to the police in the United Kingdom. With these standardized data (N = 6,422), we studied the relationship between COVID-19 public health measures and the rate and characteristics of stranger sex offending across the entire first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasting this with data from the same period pre-COVID-19. Results: Our findings accord with classic criminological theory whereby the incidence and characteristics of U.K. stranger sex offenses reported to police covaried with the population’s patterns of mobility and national lockdowns during the first year of COVID-19. This impact on routine activities also manifested in differences in perpetrator and victim behavior and characteristics. Conclusions: Our study supports the applicability of routine activity theory to sex offending and brings new insights regarding the situational prevention of sex offending during major events such as a pandemic. It is also relevant to the urgent need to educate prosecutors who are now making decisions about sex offenses perpetrated during the early years of this pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s)","coronavirus; COVID-19; rape; routine activity theory; stranger sex offending","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211066597"

A feature selection algorithm is proposed for network intrusion detection systems that uses an improved binary pigeon-inspired optimizer (SABPIO) algorithm to tackle the challenges posed by the high dimensionality and complexity of network traffic, resulting in complex models, reduced accuracy, and longer detection times. First, the raw dataset is pre-processed by uniquely one-hot encoded and standardized. Next, feature selection is performed using SABPIO, which employs simulated annealing and the population decay factor to identify the most relevant subset of features for subsequent review and evaluation. Finally, the selected subset of features is fed into decision trees and random forest classifiers to evaluate the effectiveness of SABPIO. The proposed algorithm has been validated through experimentation on three publicly available datasets: UNSWNB15, NLS-KDD, and CIC-IDS-2017. The experimental findings demonstrate that SABPIO identifies the most indicative subset of features through rational computation. This method significantly abbreviates the system's training duration, enhances detection rates, and compared to the use of all features, minimally reduces the training and testing times by factors of 3.2 and 0.3, respectively. Furthermore, it enhances the F1-score of the feature subset selected by CPIO and Boost algorithms when compared to CPIO and XGBoost, resulting in improvements ranging from 1.21% to 2.19%, and 1.79% to 4.52%. © (2024), (PeerJ Inc.).

Video surveillance is one such application that has become indispensable with plenty of unprecedented applications. Detection of abnormal events from surveillance videos in real time has its importance in applications like traffic monitoring, crime investigation, public safety, healthcare and operations management to mention few. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) automatic video surveillance is taken to the next level with sophistication in learning detection of anomalies. Particularly deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is found more appropriate for image processing. However, as one size does not fit all, CNN does not provide acceptable accuracy unless it is enhanced with suitable number of layers and configurations. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning architecture known as VidAnomalyNet which is based on CNN model. It is designed to have more appropriate learning process and detection of anomalies from surveillance videos. We proposed a framework to exploit our VidAnomalyNet architecture for leveraging detection performance. We also proposed an algorithm known as VidAnomalyNet for Automatic Anomaly Detection (VAAD). Automatic anomaly detection in the context of video anomaly networks refers to the use of computational methods to automatically identify unusual or abnormal patterns within a sequence of video frames. The goal is to develop models that can distinguish between normal activities and unexpected events or anomalies. Video anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, including surveillance, industrial monitoring, and public safety. At present, this algorithm detects three classes of anomalies like fire, accident and robbery. It can be easily extended to identify more number of anomalies.

Methods: The data were sourced from a blend of mobile device location data, Part 1 crime data from the Baltimore Police Department, the American Community Survey, and the zoning map of Baltimore. I used Poisson regression with Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (MESF) for the analysis. Results: Inward population flow consistently exhibited a positive relationship with gun violence regardless of its subtype, whereas residential mobility demonstrated significant influence primarily on firearm-related robbery incidents. Moderation analysis indicated that depending on the type of gun violence being assessed, either inward population flow or residential mobility could attenuate its association with neighborhoods' crime hotspot coverage. Conclusions: Understanding collective mobility patterns is crucial for comprehending the spread of gun violence. Such insights can assist law enforcement agencies in refining hotspot policing strategies and adapting police tactics accordingly. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Firearm; Hotspot; Mobility; Population; Violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201285727"

Existing gambling app detection methods mainly extract static content-based characteristics, such as vision and textual features, to mine the key information from the user interface to detect gambling apps. In this paper, we are the first to introduce a dynamic communication characteristic-based approach by utilizing encrypted traffic analysis. Firstly, we conduct an analysis of the communication characteristics of 175 popular gambling apps in China, and unveil their important server domain name randomization and inter-app level familial characteristics, which cannot be well-leveraged by previous encrypted traffic analysis methods. Based on the analysis results, we design HeCGamb, a Heterogeneous Communication Graph-based method to enhance the Gambling app detection performance. HeCGamb models the inter-flow relations from various traffic flows to mine the flow-level communication patterns of gambling apps. Based on the inter-flow relations, HeCGamb further constructs inter-app relations to utilize the app-level familial characteristics. Finally, the multi-view semantic information from both servers and apps with inter-app relations are fused to generate the app node representations to comprehensively leverage the characteristics from server domains and familial apps. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate the superior performance(94.1% F1-score and 96.8% AUC score in open world) of HeCGamb, but also highlight its potential in gambling industry chain tracking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Cybercrime; Encrypted traffic analysis; Heterogeneous graph learning; Mobile gambling","Cryptography; Graphic methods; Semantics; Cyber-crimes; Encrypted traffic; Encrypted traffic analyse; Flow relations; Graph-based; Heterogeneous graph; Heterogeneous graph learning; Mobile gambling; Online gambling; Traffic analysis; User interfaces","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186720797"

The strong relationships between ED and BPD may lead clinicians to underestimate ED associated to other clinical contexts. This can lead to difficulties in diagnostic and treatment orientation, especially in the context of comorbidities. In this article, after reviewing the literature on the development and functioning of emotion dysregulation, and on the evidence for emotion dysregulation in eight disorders (borderline personality disorder, pathological narcissism with/without narcissistic personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), we present a transdiagnostic processual model of emotion dysregulation based on core triggers and interpersonal styles to try to address this issue and to provide a simple but technical tool to help clinicians in their diagnostic assessment and treatment orientation. By focusing more on typical patterns and interpersonal dynamics than only on categories, we believe that this model may contribute to the actual need for improvement of our current psychiatric classifications, alongside other well-studied and under-used dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., HiTOP, AMPD), and may be useful to build more specific treatment frameworks for patients suffering from ED.

The revolutionary combination of gradient boosting and hybrid microwave transmission-based wearable devices is the ultimate solution to combat patient health data theft. With this cutting-edge technology, this research can confidently detect and prevent unauthorised access to sensitive healthcare information, ensuring the safety and privacy of patients.

UAVs are positioned as aerial wireless platforms, extending coverage and improving Sensing and Communication (S&C) services. However, integrating UAVs introduces vulnerabilities due to multi-connectivity, necessitating robust security measures. To address this, efforts are focused on developing effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Here ML-based IDSs depend on the most suited Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for improved detection accuracy. However, inadequate detection features frequently contribute to the limitations of detection accuracy in various emerging cyber-attacks. Our study explores attack traits in UAV-enabled 6G networks, using complementary detection features to enhance ML-based attack detection. Additionally, existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) solutions for UAVs-enabled 6G networks mainly use single models (e.g., CNN, SVM, CGAN) instead of multi-tier models, (e.g., Hybrid, Fusion, Ensemble). Here, although the use of a single model can be faster for computer systems, it is difficult to understand the growing complexity of intrusion patterns in data. Also, these single models might not be good at recognizing the unique patterns of less common issues in datasets. Thus, we propose a fusion multi-tier DNN-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (CIDPS) for critical UAV-enabled 6G networks. This system boosts accuracy without sacrificing latency reductions. Our approach learns decision boundaries from imbalanced data points using preceding DNNs sequentially. Moreover, most existing research works do not focus on intrusion prevention methods and deployment frameworks for UAV networks. This research proposes effective IPS mechanisms and deployment architecture for CIDPS in UAV-enabled 6G networks. It incorporates a CIDPS with an emergency response protocol, neutralizing attacks upon anomaly detection. We validate our solution through diverse dataset experiments (UAVIDS-2020, NF-UQ-NIDS-v2, 5G-NIDD). Unlike traditional practices where IDS are simulated, we implement CIDPS on actual UAV devices (PX4 Vision Dev Kit V1.5, DJI mini se, DJI mini 3 pro) and real-world UAV networks. Our approach outperforms prior algorithms with a 99.25% attack classification accuracy, higher detection efficiency, and lower resource usage, exceeding 99.05% detection rates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","6G/5G networks; DNNs; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Intrusion Prevention System (IPS); Real-time; UAV networks","5G mobile communication systems; Aircraft detection; Anomaly detection; Antennas; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Mobile security; Network security; Queueing networks; Support vector machines; 6g/5g network; Collaborative intrusion detection system; DNN; Intrusion detection and prevention systems; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion prevention system; Intrusion prevention systems; Real- time; UAV network; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193462878"

Many groups balance both strategic and psychological considerations but ultimately weigh one more heavily than the other. We propose a typology based on this trade-off between logistical and ideological resources and the degree of violence against civilians. We propose that combination produces four overarching ideal types: violent militants, militant opportunists, professional militants, or disciplined militants. We conduct a plausibility probe of the types and propose a model of how groups re-produce violence patterns once established. The four cases – the Weather Underground, al-Qaida in Iraq, the Revolutionary United Front, and autodefensas in Mexico – are extreme cases that vary in their calculus of logistics versus ideology and their degree of violence. We find that all types go through a standard process to establish and perpetuate their approach to violence. In addition, groups experience different advantages and pitfalls based on their trade-off calculus. An ideological emphasis is typically accompanied by greater oversight of recruitment and tactics, but groups that become too ideologically rigid risk collapsing from organisational problems and difficulties connecting with their constituents. Conversely, those that weigh logistical considerations more heavily have less oversight over recruitment, which increases their risks of infiltration by opportunists and criminals. © (2024), (Terrorism Research Initiative).

While many conventional defense mechanisms have been overwhelmed, Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising avenue to detect, prevent, and respond to these emerging threats. This research analyzes the intricacies of contemporary social engineering attacks, from their methods of deployment to their recent adaptations, such as leveraging social media and mobile apps. By contrasting prior solutions with the potential of AI-based defenses, we highlight the key role of machine learning in behavioral pattern recognition, Natural Language Processing's (NLP) efficacy in identifying phishing attempts, and predictive analytics' power to anticipate future attack vectors. Through detailed case studies, we showcase real-world scenarios where AI mechanisms have successfully countered social engineering ploys. The findings reveal that AI-enhanced mechanisms significantly improve the identification and mitigation of social engineering threats. Specifically, AI-driven behavioral analytics effectively detect subtle, manipulative cues indicative of phishing and other deceitful tactics, considerably reducing the incidence of successful attacks.

The increased connectivity and accessibility could lead to more cyber-attacks in smart buildings. On the other hand, physical faults (e.g., HVAC − heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning faults) may have similar adverse impacts as those from the cyber-attacks on building energy systems, such as occupant discomfort, energy wastage, and equipment downtime. However, current physical behavior-based anomaly detection methods fail to differentiate between cyber-attacks and physical faults in building energy systems. Moreover, the challenge in collecting real-world threat data with ground truth has led researchers to rely on numerical models with user-defined assumptions, which may not accurately reflect real-world conditions due to the lack of in-situ experimental datasets. To address these challenges and gaps, this paper presents a flexible hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed for generating cyber-attack and physical fault datasets and demonstrating threat detection algorithms in a real building automation system (BAS) environment. This testbed combines hardware (i.e., real BAS with local HVAC controllers and a physical network) with software (i.e., high-fidelity models to represent behaviors of building envelope and HVAC energy systems), enabling emulations of realistic threats. Five HIL experiments, including one baseline without any threats, two with physical faults, and two with cyber-attacks, were conducted to generate datasets containing detailed network traffic and system states. A joint classification framework, incorporating a network analyzer and a physical HVAC fault detector, was proposed to automatically detect cyber-physical abnormalities on BAS at both the network and the physical HVAC levels. The network analyzer comprises a conditional random fields (CRF) based command validator and a statistics-based detection strategy. The fault detector employs a weather and schedule-based pattern matching and feature-based principal component analysis (WPM-FPCA) method. Evaluation of the classification using four metrics from the multi-class confusion matrix revealed an average accuracy of 90.2 %, recall of 89.7 %, precision of 88.5 % and F1-score of 89.2 %. These results demonstrate that the proposed joint classification framework can effectively differentiate between specific types of cyber-attacks (e.g., device reinitialization attack, network Denial-of-Service attack) and physical faults (e.g., air handling unit operational fault, cooling coil valve stuck) in real time for improved building energy management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Building energy management system; Cyber-attacks; Hardware-in-the-loop; Physical faults; Smart buildings","Air conditioning; Anomaly detection; Automation; Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Cyber Physical System; Data Analytics; Electric loads; Fast Fourier transforms; Fault detection; Global warming; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Network security; Pattern matching; Real time systems; Building automation systems; Building energy management systems; Building energy systems; Classification framework; Cyber physicals; Cyber-attacks; Fault detector; Hardware in the loops; Physical faults; Real-world; Principal component analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199955823"

Traditionally, documenting a crime scene for a bloodletting event was completed using manual techniques, physical strings, and a tape measure. In more recent years, laser scanners and 3D software programs have become a preferred method to capture accurate data that improves the validity and reliability of BPA. The initial cost of laser scanning equipment is relatively high, rendering these systems inaccessible to some police and smaller agencies. Recon-3D is a newly developed iPhone application that utilizes the iPhone LiDAR sensor in combination with video data to create 3D point clouds of crime scenes. To assess the viability of Recon-3D for area of origin analysis, two tests were performed. One was a series of bloodstain impacts which were analyzed in FARO Zone 3D software, while the second was a series of 6 repeated Recon-3D scans of two 90-degree walls which was then compared to the FARO Focus S350 scanner using CloudCompare software. A total of eight impact patterns were made at three different distances from a wall. The area of origin was measured and compared to the known location of the blood source. The average total 3D error for the area of origin set at 25, 50, and 100 cm from two perpendicular walls was found to be 6.04, 15.16, and 36.59 cm, respectively. These results are similar to past studies where programs such as HemoSpat have been used. The results of the point cloud comparison show that on average, 95% of the points from Recon-3D fall below a threshold of 3.6 mm when compared to a FARO Focus S350 laser scanner. Thus, the results of this test suggest that Recon-3D is an accurate and affordable scanning application for bloodstain patterns at crime scenes and the data provide acceptable results for area of origin analysis in BPA programs which accept laser scanner data. © 2024 The Authors.

Scholars have debated how neighborhoods should be operationalized for decades. While recent scholarship has de-emphasized boundaries, I argue that boundaries are focal to understanding what neighborhoods are and why they are so segregated. Relying on everyday mobility patterns data from a panel of 45 million nationally representative devices, I demonstrate that divisions between contiguous census block groups in terms of everyday mobility patterns align with divisions in race, educational attainment, occupation, and age. Employing a novel clustering procedure, I further demonstrate that sets of census block groups can be easily separated in terms of differences in mobility patterns, indicating that meaningful clusters and boundaries within cities do exist. Subsequent results indicate these clusters are uniquely segregated in terms of race, educational attainment, and age, highlighting how other spatial aggregations can underestimate true segregation. Additional results suggest that unique social processes divide these clusters from one another, as indicated by exceptional variation in both COVID-19 case incidence and criminal offense timing. While I do not believe these clusters represent objective “neighborhoods,” I do assert that they can serve as a useful geographical unit for social analyses. These clusters may also be useful for measuring segregation in mobility patterns as well as for studying mobility network resiliency. © 2024 Karl Vachuska.

Insiders pose such a great threat due to their access, authority, and knowledge, granting them opportunities to bypass dedicated nuclear and radiological security elements. For example, in one of the latest major insider threat incidents to nuclear security, the Doel-4 nuclear powerplant in Belgium suffered a shutdown, the threat of nuclear materials diversion, and long-term loss of tens of millions of dollars. Seven years of investigation concluded that it was an inside job and attempted sabotage. In this regard, there is an immediate need for R&D and technology integration in the domain of modeling indoor Patterns-of-Life (PoL) and anomaly detection. This can be achieved by using datasets of facility users' mobility and activity, which can support the design of algorithms for insider threat modeling and detection. However, due to classification, privacy, sensitivity, and safety protocols, such datasets from real physical nuclear reactor facilities are not only hard to share, but also not always feasible to deploy and collect. Aiming to find an alternate solution, our proposed demonstration work - MetaPoL, is the first-ever (for the application space) immersive VR (virtual reality) environment of a real-world secure facility and allows users to move-and-stay through the designed indoor physical layout and also encounter NPCs (non-player characters) that emulate other facility users. In the MetaPoL an interactive user performs realistic spatio-temporal movement, dwelling and activities using a Meta Quest Pro VR headset, and that generates high-frequency (in time) high-resolution (in space) indoor spatial-temporal datasets that are valuable for PoL modeling and anomaly detection research specifically for insider threat modeling and detection mission. Such generated realistic, rich in context, and mission specific datasets can boost AI/Machine Learning based research for modeling and detecting insider threats in nuclear security and nonproliferation. © 2024 IEEE.","anomaly detection; human-computer interaction (HCI); indoor mobility data; insider threat and sabotage; insider threat modeling; Metaverse; Nuclear security; patterns of life (PoL); spatial-temporal data; virtual reality (VR)","Anomaly detection; Crime; Human computer interaction; Nuclear reactors; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive materials; Virtual reality; Anomaly detection; Human-computer interaction; Indoor mobility; Indoor mobility data; Insider Threat; Insider threat and sabotage; Insider threat modeling; Metaverses; Mobility datum; Nuclear security; Pattern of life; Spatial-temporal data; Threat modeling; Virtual reality; Classification (of information)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199632885"

Methods: Using data from a large sample of criminal defendants prosecuted during 2010 to 2011 in New York County (N = 68,113), we analyze differences in charge reductions for defendants who reside and offend in low- and high-income areas, and for those who traverse socioeconomically divergent neighborhoods when committing crime. Results: Net of individual defendant characteristics, like gender and race, we find that defendants from low-income neighborhoods who offend in high-income locales are significantly less likely to benefit from discretionary charge reductions. Conclusions: Defendant mobility patterns play a key role in defining the social context of criminal punishment.

This surge in interest stems from the utilization of surveillance cameras in diverse locations, where visual data is analysed to detect instances of violence. The project's objectives are tailored to address key research gaps within the realm of crime detection. Firstly, it aims to refine a pre-trained model through meticulous fine-tuning, culminating in the development of a robust crime detection algorithm. Secondly, the project endeavours to transcend theoretical realms by deploying this model in real-time scenarios, seamlessly integrating it with live camera feeds to enable continuous monitoring and analysis. Lastly, the project will conduct a thorough comparative analysis of various models, discerning their strengths and weaknesses to pinpoint the optimal solution for effective crime detection. Through these objectives, the project aspires to contribute significantly to the advancement of crime detection technologies. The methodology employed includes collecting images for the dataset, cleaning and pre-processing the data, augmenting it for diversity and it increases dataset diversity through transformations. Implementation is done of transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG, and training the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data for accurate predictions or classifications. Model training is essential for the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data, minimizing prediction errors. The results reveal a peak accuracy F1-score of 95% achieved with ResNet. A high F1score of 96% indicates strong performance in accurately identifying positive instances while minimizing false positives and false negatives.  © 2024 IEEE.","crime; f1-score; mobilenet; pretrained model; vgg; violence","Cameras; Computer vision; Data handling; Security systems; CNN models; Crime detection; F1 scores; Growing demand; Learn+; Mobilenet; Pretrained model; Vgg; Violence; Violence detections; Crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200153617"

While extensive research has examined variations in violent crime rates across neighborhoods, less attention has been given to understanding individuals’ everyday exposure to violent crimes. This study investigates patterns of exposure to violent crimes among neighborhood residents using cell phone mobility data and violent crime reports from Chicago. The analysis reveals a positive association between the proportion of Black residents in a neighborhood and the level of exposure to violent crimes experienced by residents. Controlling for a neighborhood’s level of residential disadvantage and other neighborhood characteristics did not substantially diminish the relationship between racial composition and exposure to violent crimes in everyday life. Even after controlling for violence within residents’ neighborhoods, individuals residing in Black neighborhoods continue to experience significantly higher levels of violence in their day-to-day contexts compared to those living in White neighborhoods. This suggests that racial segregation in everyday exposures, rather than residential segregation, plays a central role in racial inequality in exposure to violence. Additionally, the analysis suggests that neighborhoods with more Hispanic and Asian residents are exposed to less and more violent crime, respectively, compared to neighborhoods with more White residents. However, this is only observed when not adjusting for the volume of visits points of interest receive; otherwise, the finding is reversed. This study offers valuable insights into potentially novel sources of racial disparities in exposure to violent crimes in everyday contexts, highlighting the need for further investigation. © The New York Academy of Medicine 2024.","Neighborhoods; Racial inequality; Violence","Adult; Black or African American; Chicago; Crime; Exposure to Violence; Female; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neighborhood Characteristics; Racism; Residence Characteristics; Residential Segregation; Social Segregation; Socioeconomic Factors; Violence; White People; adult; African American; Caucasian; crime; ethnology; exposure to violence; female; Hispanic; human; Illinois; male; middle aged; neighborhood characteristic; psychology; racism; residence characteristics; social segregation; socioeconomics; violence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197904628"

By focusing on the experiences of the disillusioned and the disenfranchised across a range of class backgrounds, I show how money and mobility and crime and capitalism intersect in a dense urban environment. Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is considered the infrastructural and economic laboratory for Indonesia's new economy. As e-commerce and fintech alter consumption patterns and shape urban entrepreneurial and lifestyle aspirations for millions of Indonesians, the risks and advantages associated with increased financialization have had a profound impact on ordinary citizens. Indonesians are increasingly drawn into everyday, data-rich transactions that habituate and concretize the practice of speculative consumption and interactions with strangers in the city. While the state celebrates the outward rise of financial inclusion, the financialization of everyday life has also produced victims of financial fraud and deceit, in particular through predatory scams (modus) that rely on legal and regulatory gaps and intimate knowledge of others to succeed. This paper probes the social conditions that enable fraud and its extralegal resolutions, emphasizing the destabilizing, extraordinary experiences of urban citizens who see no justice for the ways they have been conscripted into a dangerous new economy.

This spatial and temporal approach to the study of everyday activity spaces reveals much about victimisation experiences, the relationship between place, time, and perceptions of safety, and where and when offending may occur. Few studies, however, consider the relationship between living in a criminogenic place (neighbourhood crime) and people’s daily activity patterns. Drawing on disaggregate app-based data for 50 participants tracked over a 7-day period, we use sequence analysis to first delineate time allocation to each activity on a minute-by-minute basis. Next, using result from the sequence analysis we introduce the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to understand how neighbourhood crime and socio-demographic characteristics influence individuals’ time allocation to discrete daily activities. Results reveal that neighbourhood drug and violent incidents exert restrictions on an individual’s propensity to spend time outside the home. Females and older people appear more likely to be constrained by the presence of neighbourhood crime (in particular drug and property incidents) as they allocate less time to outdoor activities. The principal utility of the current study is its methodological advancement and the practical insights for urban planning regarding the design of crime prevention strategies to increase guardianship in public places. © The Author(s) 2024.","daily activity patterns; multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model; neighbourhood crime; sequence analysis; Space-Time Budget; Time allocation choice","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193828459"

Automobile owners are storing extensive data on driving behaviors and patterns. This study pioneers the forensic analysis of Progressive's Snapshot application, focusing on the extraction and potential forensic use of data that remains inaccessible through the mobile application's interface. In our approach we focused on four research questions: How accurate is location and speed data collected by Progressive Snapshot?, What forensically relevant data can we extract from the Progressive Cloud that is unavailable to the user from the mobile application interface?, Can we employ anti-forensics techniques, specifically fake location data, to create false trip details?, Can we reconstruct a hit-and-run scenario from trip event details? To answer these questions, we developed PyShot, a Python-based open-source tool, to extract data from the Progressive cloud. Our tests confirmed Snapshot's accuracy in recording speed and location. Despite efforts to fake the Global Positioning System (GPS) location, the cloud still maintained accurate records. PyShot revealed more detailed driving data, like dangerous maneuvers and distracted driving, compared to the mobile application. This study also explores the forensic reconstruction of hit-and-run incidents, using a mannequin and focusing on Progressive's server data. Analyzing event categories, geographical coordinates, and timestamps provides insights into the capabilities and constraints of this application in forensic investigations.

This poses a challenge in detecting anomalies effectively. Cyber-attacks jeopardize privacy, compliance, and lead to service interruptions, revenue loss, and customer churn. This research explores anomaly detection methods, including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning, in the context of prevalent data patterns and the five stages of cyber-attacks. Machine learning plays a crucial role in monitoring traffic, analyzing scan results, detecting, and blocking attacks, and revealing the attacker' s identity. The focus is on evaluating AI methods for anomaly detection, leveraging the H20.ai tool, known for its potent machine learning algorithms and seamless integration with existing systems. This enhances AI functionality for meaningful insights during cyber-attacks. The paper emphasizes the importance of robust anomaly detection in reducing Cyber Value at Risk (CVaR) and achieving cybersecurity excellence.

Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort. © 2023","Agent-based model; Decision-making; Environmental criminology; Rational choice perspective; Reinforcement learning","Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Computational methods; Crime; Intelligent agents; Learning systems; Rational functions; Reinforcement learning; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Decision-making frameworks; Decisions makings; Environmental criminology; Learn+; Rational choice perspective; Reinforcement learning approach; Reinforcement learnings; Theoretical framework; Traditional techniques; decision making; empirical analysis; perception; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196859618"

Moreover, it has been argued that changes in the level of social mobility also affect crime rates. Decreased crime rates have been reported during closure measures, and a significant literature has emerged based on these propositions. This study's retrospective approach was created to examine the appearance of crime rates in Türkiye. The main problem of the research is to reveal the relationship between crime, pandemic, and social mobility in Türkiye. For this purpose, it aimed to test the propositions based on a dual approach. First, patterns in crime rates were discovered. The data set regarding the most common crime types between 2018 and 2022, including pre-pandemic crime rates, was used. The most appropriate time series model was determined to understand the data structure regarding crime types, and it was tested whether there was a decrease or increase in crime rates during and after the pandemic. As a second step, the effect of social mobility on the change in crime was examined according to the mobility level data reported in this process. Evidence has shown decreased violence, theft, and drug crimes in the early part of the pandemic, consistent with the literature. While theft crimes decreased throughout the pandemic, violence and drug crimes increased. The view that crime rates will decrease if social mobility is restricted as a source of social life presented overlapping data in the pandemic. Changes in social mobility during the pandemic have affected crime rates for theft, injury, and drug use. Although there was a decrease in crime rates due to seasonal effects after the normalization process, it was observed that crime rates could change according to the content of social measures during the pandemic period. It is considered that this situation presents a particular slice for the future. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Crime; Pandemic; Social Mobility; Time Series Models; Türkiye","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175560175"

Methods: A retrospective ecological analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic using an event study methodology. This paper uses administrative data from Mexico’s National Public Security System from January 2017 to December 2022. Our data is structured as a monthly series covering all 2457 Mexican municipalities. Results: We find heterogeneity in the pandemic’s impact by type of property crime and a dynamic, permanent effect for both types of property crime. Namely, our results point to a drop and quick recovery of fraud—property crime mostly committed on-line—, which in the medium run surpasses pre-pandemic levels by 44%. Further, our results point to a significant drop in robbery, theft, domestic burglary, and motor vehicle theft—all property crimes committed on-site—, with a slight recovery after the end of the national lockdown, even though rates for these crimes never reached pre-pandemic levels. Conclusions: The 2020 pandemic caused a permanent shift in property crime from on-site to on-line spaces.

Taking this region as the core research area, grounding our analysis in the theoretical framework of social-ecological systems theory, using spatial analysis, geo-detector and other methods, to explore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and influencing factors of wildlife crime in the Sichuan-Chongqing region. Study findings include the following: (1) wildlife crimes in the Sichuan-Chongqing regions mainly involve illegal hunting and killing precious and endangered wildlife, the species involved are predominantly birds and beasts, with the number of pheasants of the pheasant family, owls, and various snakes of the reptile family being the most numerous. The main body of the offence is far more men than women, and young adult Han people are often involved. The overall cultural level is low, and the main job is farming. (2) A single wildlife crime often involves a number of offenses; the most common criminal process involves (seller) hunting/hunting-killing-transportation-selling- (buyer) acquisition. (3) The overall inter-annual variation of the crime shows strong volatility, which can be divided into a gradual growth phase, a sharp decline phase and a sharp growth phase, the monthly distribution is high in November. (4) The overall pattern of ""high incidence in the east and west and low incidence in the center"" is shown in the city scale; in the county scale, the Shuangliu District of Chengdu City and Wanzhou District of Chongqing City are the most common. In microplaces, there are differences in the main places where offences are committed and transacted under different offences. (5) The occurrence of crime is mainly affected by the average annual temperature, total water resources, the state of natural ecosystems and other natural factors, male and female gender ratio, level of education, transport network density, ease of access and other socio-economic and cultural factors; the level of consumption of the population, the rate of natural growth and the combination of other factors have a significant impact on wildlife crime. The integrated crime pattern theory and rational choice theory suggest that by rationally considering multiple factors such as the natural environment (e. g. abundant wildlife resources and hidden habitats), the social environment (e. g. weak regulation, strong market demand or weak public awareness of protection) and their own psychological characteristics (e. g. the relationship between costs and benefits), offenders are more likely to convert their criminal intent into actual action, which will in turn The criminal intent is more likely to be transformed into actual action, thus contributing to the eventual occurrence of the criminal behaviour. © 2024 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

Based on the geographical coordinates of mobile devices, we computed two measures of density of the ambient population and the tourist presence, for work days, weekends, and holidays in 2019. Negative binomial regressions are then estimated to analyse whether these measures are correlated with the risk of robbery, controlling for land use and the characteristics of the social environment. The model reveals that residents’ chances of being exposed to robbery in Barcelona depend on the social relevance and tourism attractiveness of certain places at particular times of the year. Our results disclose two sources of social disorganization as stronger predictors of the occurrence of robbery in Barcelona, respectively linked to structural processes of residential instability and daily and seasonal mobility patterns. On the one hand, we found that the effect of the density of international tourists on the outcome variable is mediated by residential volatility, which is assumed to be associated with housing shortages in neighbourhoods where short-term vacation rentals are widespread. On the other hand, the ability to exert effective social control is significantly undermined in urban areas, where the ambient population and the volume of tourists outnumber the resident population, thus increasing incidents of robbery victimization. The implications of these findings for urban policy and crime prevention in the Catalan capital are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.","Ambient population; Density; Mobility; Robbery; Tourism pressure","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137234561"

We utilized population distribution by gender and age group at different times of the day. After extracting daily patterns (factors) of the population using non-negative matrix factorization, we statistically modeled the risk of indecent assault using a spatial conditional autoregressive model. The results showed that the model, which considered a spatiotemporal ambient population, demonstrated superior performance during nighttime hours.

The SADC framework employs GPS and LiDAR sensor attack detectors and the Pattern-based Attack Classification (PAC) algorithm. It combats new-age cyberattacks and provides an accurate sensor attack detection and classification mechanism in AVs. A protocol-based attack detection scheme in SADC is developed to identify the abnormal source sensor based on the detector’s results. The PAC algorithm classifies malicious sensors by analyzing different strategies: instant, constant, bias, and gradual drift.

We carry out a spatial regression analysis of more than 1700 firms, with special emphasis on restaurants/hotels and construction, confiscated from mafia groups in Italy against a set of variables related to the social and criminal environment (with a special emphasis on mafia presence) after controlling for the local business structure and the economic/financial composition of the areas. Ceteris paribus, mafia investments in the construction industry are greater in regions with a higher level of mafia presence, infiltration of public administration and more protected markets; while investments in bars, restaurants and hotels are greater in areas characterized by less rooted mafia presence, higher violence, higher trade openness and cash intensity. The results suggest that mafia investments in construction can benefit from the opportunities offered by grip on the territory and on the public administration; and those in restaurants by concealment drivers, such as money laundering.

Current studies often concentrate on the travel patterns and destination preferences of criminals, but there is a lack of research from the criminals' perspective, considering the built environment and road network structure to analyze their criminal travel routes. To address this gap, a spatiotemporal analysis approach is proposed, considering criminals' cognition of concealment. Based on the principles of criminal psychology and rational choice theory, this paper categorizes the travel patterns of criminals under the cognition of concealment into two principles: ""the Principle of Minimal Exposure Risk"" and ""the Principle of Minimal Travel Cost"". Firstly, the urban perceptual elements within a criminal's perceptual range, including safety and risk perception elements that bring exposure risks, are calculated and introduced into the choice degree model. The ""Criminal Choice Degree of Roads"" is proposed to measure the optimal local roads within a criminal's perceptual range. Next, using the ""Length of the Route Already Traveled"" as the cost function and the ""Criminal Choice Degree of Roads"" within the perceptual range as the heuristic function, an improved heuristic algorithm is employed to calculate the overall optimal criminal travel route. Finally, from the perspective of crime prevention and control, experiments are conducted to analyze the distribution of urban road choice degrees and the criminal travel routes of key personnel. By comparing the routes obtained by this method with those derived from existing methods and actual criminal travel routes, it is shown that the routes calculated by this proposed method are more reasonable. They are more likely to be chosen by criminals for concealment and have relatively short travel distances, without long-term exposure in public areas. The routes, in terms of distance, travel time, and the urban perceptual elements they pass through, are closer to the actual travel behaviors of criminals, verifying the rationality of this method. The research conclusion provides decision support for public security early warning efforts, emphasizing the importance of balancing travel distance and exposure risk when monitoring key personnel, and the need to allocate resources based on the distribution of urban perceptual elements and road networks to enable timely and accurate crime prevention and interception. © 2024 Science Press.

Findings show that passengers’ safety perceptions are more affected by the physical and social characteristics of transit environments than passengers’ victimisation. Yet, for those who have reduced mobility, the station affects the likelihood of their being victimised. Lack of staff and poor maintenance of the station are two significant attributes associated with the lower levels of safety perceived by passengers as well as levels of crime and panhandling at both the station and on the way to it. Compared with all passengers, women, but in particular those who identify as LGBTQI+ /Non-binary/Other, run a higher likelihood of feeling less safe.

By inspecting the effects of different government responses and changes in population mobility on various types of fraud, we found that more stringent restrictions were associated with larger increases in most types of cyber-enabled fraud, except for those that rely on offline activities, whereas the impact on traditional fraud was mixed and contingent upon specific opportunity structures. These findings overall align with the assumptions of routine activity theory and provide clear support for its applicability in fraud and cybercrime. © The Author(s) 2024.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212497728"

This study explores the application of laser desorption (LD) ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as a novel method for this purpose utilising a new IMS prototype developed by MaSaTECH. Methods: The LD sampling technique employs a laser diode module to vaporise explosive traces on surfaces, allowing immediate analysis by IMS without sample preparation. Chemometric approaches, including multivariate data analysis, were utilised for data processing and interpretation, including pre-processing of raw IMS plasmagrams and various pattern recognition techniques, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVMs). Results: The IMS prototype was validated through experiments with pure explosives (TNT, RDX, PETN) and explosive products (SEMTEX 1A, C4) on different materials. The study found that the pre-processing method significantly impacts classification accuracy, with the PCA-LDA model demonstrating the best performance for real-world applications. Conclusions: The LD-IMS prototype, coupled with effective chemometric techniques, presents a promising methodology for the detection of explosives in forensic investigations, enhancing the reliability of field applications. © 2025 by the authors.","chemometrics; crime scene investigation; data pretreatment; environmental and security applications; explosives; forensic; IMS; multivariate data analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214444381"

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered socioeconomic activities, potentially causing changes in crime patterns. However, there has been limited research on how the interaction between the pandemic and socioeconomic factors affects cybercrime. Here we explore the spatiotemporal patterns of police-recorded cybercrime, including fraud and cyber-dependent crime, and employ a machine learning approach to assess the correlation of various factors on cybercrimes at the level of internal regions and police areas within the United Kingdom. Our results show that fraud and cyber-dependent crime are mainly concentrated in London and the southeast region of England. Moreover, following the implementation of the third national lockdown, these areas experienced a noticeable increase, while changes in other regions were not as pronounced. The spatial autocorrelation analysis further suggests that there are significant spatial heterogeneities among regions, with spatiotemporal hotspots centered around London and cold spots mainly concentrated in the northeast of England. Additionally, we found that the identified patterns of fraud and cyber-dependent crime are primarily associated with socioeconomic factors, followed by government containment measures and mobility factors. These findings can help law enforcement and regulatory agencies better understand the social-environmental factors contributing to the prevalence of cybercrime within those areas. © The Author(s) 2024.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210451675"

This chapter situates the crimmigration discussion in the context of the changing social dimensions of hukou, starting with the great internal migration in mid-1990s China. While this period saw the decline of hukou’s fundamental and essential role in governance, this chapter suggests that hukou has been mischaracterized by academics as well as commentators from China and the West. Hukou should be seen neither as a form of institutional segregation, nor as an identification of citizen rights, nor as a rationalization of the past, nor as a tautological element of China’s uniqueness. This chapter reflects on a historical development of hukou and its function in social control. It investigates the linkages between hukou, patterns of crime, and criminal legal practices, and their effects on selectiveness and disparities in broader political, social, and economic spheres in China. This reflection supports an extended analysis of pragmatic aspects of each decision-making moment in the criminal justice system in terms of mobility control, namely, the re-bordering process in post-hukou China. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, José A.

This has led to the growing importance of identifying the source of video files to trace the owner of the files involved in the incident or identify the distributor. Previous research has concentrated on revealing the device (brand and/or model) that “originally” created a video file. This has been achieved by analysing the pattern noise generated by the image sensor in the camera, the storage structural features of the file, and the metadata patterns. However, due to the widespread use of mobile environments, instant messaging applications (IMAs) such as Telegram and Wire have been utilized to share illegal videos, which can result in the loss of information from the original file due to re-encoding at the application level, depending on the transmission settings. Consequently, it is necessary to extend the scope of existing research to identify the various applications that are capable of re-encoding video files in transit. Furthermore, it is essential to determine whether there are features that can be leveraged to distinguish them from the source identification perspective. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based methodology for classifying the source application by extracting various features stored in the storage format and internal metadata of video files. To conduct this study, we analyzed 16 IMAs that are widely used in mobile environments and generated a total of 1974 sample videos, taking into account both the transmission options and encoding settings offered by each IMA. The training and testing results on this dataset indicate that the ExtraTrees model achieved an identification accuracy of approximately 99.96 %. Furthermore, we developed a proof-of-concept tool based on the proposed method, which extracts the suggested features from videos and queries a pre-trained model. This tool is released as open-source software for the community. © 2024","AVC; Digital forensics; HEVC; Machine learning; Multimedia forensics; Source identification","Adversarial machine learning; Computer forensics; Crime; Digital image storage; Forensic engineering; Metadata; AVC; HEVC; Instant messaging; Machine-learning; Mobile environments; Multimedia forensics; Re-encoding; Sources identifications; Video files; Video sources; Instant messaging applications","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209250226"

The design of a system that can match the details of different images is still an open problem, especially when applied to large databases or, to real-time applications in forensic scenarios using mobile devices. Fingerprints collected at a crime scene are often manually processed to find those that are relevant to solving the crime. This work proposes an efficient methodology that can be applied in real time to reduce the manual work in crime scene investigations that consumes time and human resources. The proposed methodology includes four steps: (i) image pre-processing using oriented Gabor filters; (ii) the extraction of minutiae using a variant of the Crossing Numbers method which include a novel ROI definition through convex hull and erosion followed by replacing two or more very close minutiae with an average minutiae; (iii) the creation of a model that represents each minutia through the characteristics of a set of polygons including neighboring minutiae; (iv) the individual search of a match for each minutia in different images using metrics on the absolute and relative errors. While in the literature most methodologies look to validate the entire fingerprint model, connecting the minutiae or using minutiae triplets, we validate each minutia individually using n-vertex polygons whose vertices are neighbor minutiae that surround the reference. Our method also reveals robustness against false minutiae since several polygons are used to represent the same minutia, there is a possibility that even if there are false minutia, the true polygon is present and identified; in addition, our method is immune to rotations and translations. The results show that the proposed methodology can be applied in real time in standard hardware implementation, with images of arbitrary orientations. © 2024 by the authors.","biometrics; fingerprints; forensic analysis; minutiae; polygons","Benchmarking; Biometry; Computers, Handheld; Dermatoglyphics; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Crime; Forensic science; Gabor filters; Geometry; Biometric keys; Fingerprint; Fingerprint Recognition; Forensic analysis; Large database; Minutia; Polygon; Real- time; Real-time application; benchmarking; biometry; dermatoglyphics; human; image processing; procedures; Biometrics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183316452"

These attacks exploit social engineering techniques to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information or engaging in unintended actions. To counter this evolving threat landscape, this research proposes a pioneering methodology rooted in voice feature analysis. By distinguishing between human and robotic voices, this approach aims to discern legitimate calls from potential scams, thereby mitigating the associated financial losses and reputational damage. The research delves into the intricacies of voice feature analysis, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to extract and analyze audio attributes such as pitch, volume, and temporal patterns. The ultimate objective is to create a binary classification model that accurately differentiates between human voice calls and robocalls, incorporating a comprehensive dataset comprising actual call recordings and synthesized scenarios. This research advances beyond conventional practices by championing a holistic analysis of both human and robocalls, contrary to the prevalent assumption of robocalls exclusively constituting scams. The application of various audio features, coupled with nuanced weightage allocation, enhances the model's discernment capabilities. The resultant binary classifier is an exemplar of the innovative fusion of technology and human expertise. In conclusion, this research introduces a novel dimension to the combat against vishing and smishing attacks, with a robust voice feature analysis methodology capable of accurately identifying human and robotic voices. By effectively distinguishing legitimate calls from potential threats, this approach presents a promising avenue for safeguarding individuals and organizations against the far-reaching consequences of cybercrimes.

For this study, we collected 9,193 U.S. missing-persons records for the years 1996-2021 from the Doe Network platform. We used mathematical statistics and Moran's I index to analyze the sociodemographic characteristics, spatio-temporal distribution and its evolution patterns. Then the geodetector was applied to conduct an in-depth analysis of the influencing factors in socio-cultural, economic and demographic aspects. Based on above findings, a sociological theory of the formation mechanism of the missing-person phenomenon in the United States was proposed. Major findings included: (1) With age increasing, the number of missing persons initially increased and then dropped gradually. The highest missing rate was found among adolescents (13-18 years old) and adults (19-59 years old). Although more males than females were reported missing, the high-incidence period of males lagged slightly behind that of females. The high missing rate among adolescent females was linked to sexual crimes, including sex trafficking and rape, while that of adult men tended to be caused by family discord or debt problems. Among racial groups, black people faced the greatest risk of going missing. (2) From 1996, the number of missing-person incidents initially showed a wave upward trended and then fell sharply, after peaking in 2017, because of a series of immigration regulations. In 2020, it declined dramatically again, due to COVID-19. Influenced by the temperature, school holidays, and festivals, most people were reported missing during the months of June, August, and December. Only few missing incidents happened between February and April. (3) Spatially, at the state level, the missing population distribution decreased from the coastal border area to the inland area; over time, areas with a great number of missing-person incidents advanced simultaneously from the eastern and western coastal areas and the southern US-Mexico border to US inland areas. At the county level, they were concentrated on the edge and scattered internally. (4) Missing-person incidents were caused by the interaction of multiple factors; regional population mobility, fertility rate, and the number of vulnerable people had a positive impact on numbers of missing people, while per capital GDP had a negative impact. The power of population-based environmental factors was significantly enhanced after be interacted with social and economic factors, on explaining the missing-person spatial distribution, all of which were above 80%. (5) The underlying mechanism of missing-person incidents could be understood from the perspective of ""social anomie"". In other words, the disconnect between social goals and means led to social anomie, which then induced deviant behavior, including abduction, murder, and running away from home, increasing the likelihood of missing-person incidents. Finally, we offered suggestions for disappearance prevention and further study directions. The findings provided a basic understanding of the missing-person phenomenon, contributing to global scientific information, which could aid in preventing missing-person incidents. © Starobulgarska Literatura 2022.","Geodetector; missing persons; missing risk; social anomie theory; social environment; United States","United States; adolescence; black population; COVID-19; crime; detection method; formation mechanism; immigration policy; sexual violence; spatiotemporal analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143641615"

These shoppers rely on credit cards as a payment method or use a mobile wallet for their purchases. Thus, credit cards have become the main payment method in the e-world. Given the many transactions that occur daily, criminals propose tremendous opportunities to find different ways of attacking and stealing credit card information. Fraudulent credit card transactions are a serious business issue. These types of scams can result in significant economic and personal losses. As a result, businesses are increasingly devoted to developing new ideas and methods for detecting and preventing fraud, as well as acquiring their customer's trust and protecting their privacy. In recent years, learning algorithms have emerged as important in research fields aimed at developing solutions to this issue. In this paper, the proposed framework will develop a two-stage anomaly and fraud detection model that uses a strengthened anomaly clustering algorithm in the first stage to find fraud patterns in transactions. The second stage uses a learning classifier to detect fraud in transactions based on fraud patterns and clients' spending behavior. The transactions will be well balanced using hybrid sampling techniques to enhance the performance of the model. This framework also aims to optimize the learning classifier model, which will improve other existing models in terms of performance, computation time, and accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.","anomaly detection; credit card; fraud detection; machine learning; optimization; sampling techniques","Clustering algorithms; Crime; Electronic commerce; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Anomaly detection; Credit cards; E- commerces; Fraud detection; Learning classifiers; Machine-learning; Online shopping; Optimisations; Payment methods; Sampling technique; Anomaly detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152405417"

Globally, an estimated 25 million adults and children are subjected to modern slavery or human trafficking. In India, approximately 7 thousand cases of human trafficking have been reported as of 2021 (ILO, 2022). The present study aims to contextualize the changing levels and patterns of human trafficking by integrating demographic and spatial dimensions by considering the dynamics of human trafficking with space, population, time, and circumstances in India. The study uses information from human trafficking cases reported by police records data accessed from Indiastat (www.Indiastat.com), an online repository supervised by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India. The present study deploys descriptive statistical techniques to accomplish the objectives, as the descriptive design provides a detailed and accurate data representation. Location quotient (LQ) mapping is used to detect the degree of victimization by human trafficking for 2021. The volume of human trafficking remained stagnant (above five thousand) until 2017, but it decreased in 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown restricting human mobility. Forced labor (43%) and sexual exploitation (33%) are the leading causes of trafficking in India. Rajasthan (80.8%) male victims and Maharashtra (94.0%) female victims reported the highest reported cases of human trafficking by gender.

In our work, we have used a digital SLR camera modified to obtain a nominal sensitivity beyond the visible spectrum. The goal is to obtain forensic evidences from a crime scene using the multispectral camera by an expert in the field knowing which wavelength filters and correct illumination sources should be used, making visible latent evidences hidden from the human-eye. In this paper, we show a procedure to retrieve from latent forensic traces, showing the validity of the system in different real cases (blood stains, hidden/erased tattoos, unlocking patterns on mobile devices).

Then, it presents three real-case studies showing how data analysis methodologies can provide innovative solutions to deal with smart city issues. The first one is an approach for spatio-temporal crime forecasting (tested on Chicago crime data), the second one is methodology to discover mobility hotsposts and trajectory patterns from GPS data (tested on Beijing taxi traces), the third one is an approach to discover predictive epidemic patterns from mobility and infection data (tested on real COVID-19 data).

Most existing methods only consider the fixed time and space between successive check-in points when capturing sequential patterns from trajectory history. However, single granularity is inadequate to mine the spatial-temporal influence on sequential patterns in sparse and incomplete check-in data. Besides, they neglect the relevance between non-adjacent check-ins and fail to fully exploit factors for the correlation mining. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel model for the next POI recommendation via multi-granularity context and correlation. It focuses on exploring vital factors for modeling effective spatial-temporal contexts and mining potential correlations among check-ins. Specifically, for context modeling, we explore effective spatial-temporal contexts to learn mobility patterns locally and globally by introducing hierarchical regions and slots. For correlation modeling, we only focus on the geographical influence. We employ a spatial-aware function to measure the correlations among check-ins to find the predictive ones for the recommendation. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets indicate that our MGCOCO consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Context; Correlation; Geographical Influence; Multi-grained; POI Recommendation","Check-in; City construction; Context; Correlation; Fixed time; Geographical influence; Multi-grained; POI recommendation; Sequential patterns; Spatial temporals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138717249"

Some of this work has focused on contagiousness as operationalized by the spread across geographical space, while other work has examined the spread within social networks. While the latter body of work struggles with incomplete network data, the former constitutes a theoretical mismatch with how violence should spread. Theory instead strongly suggests that violence contagion should diffuse through everyday mobility networks rather than just adjacently through geographical space. Beyond contagion itself, I argue that neighborhoods connected through mobility networks should serve as useful short-term sensors in predicting imminent violence because these sets of residents tend to experience shared environmental exposures, which may induce synchrony in the likelihood of violence. I explore this topic and these relationships using violent crime data from the three largest U.S. cities: New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Using two-way fixed effects models, I test whether or not violence in mobility-connected alter neighborhoods in the preceding hour predicts violence in an ego neighborhood in the next hour. Across all three jurisdictions, I find that recent violence in the neighborhoods to which a neighborhood is connected through mobility ties can strongly predict that neighborhood’s odds of subsequent violence. Furthermore, spatial proximity has no significant effect on the likelihood of violent crime after controlling for mobility ties. I conclude by arguing that mobility patterns are an important pathway in the prediction of violence. © 2022 by the author.","contagion; mobility networks; mobility patterns; violence","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196676041"

According to the routine activity perspective, these should alter where crime occurs. For burglary, greater household occupancy should increase guardianship against residential burglaries, particularly during the day considering factors such as working from home. Conversely, there should be less eyes on the street to protect against non-residential burglaries. Methods: In this paper, we test these expectations using a spatio-temporal model with crime and Google Community Mobility data. Results: As expected, burglary declined during the pandemic and restrictions. Different types of burglary were, however, affected differently but largely consistent with theoretical expectation. Residential and attempted residential burglaries both decreased significantly. This was particularly the case during the day for completed residential burglaries. Moreover, while changes were coincident with the timing and relaxation of restrictions, they were better explained by fluctuations in household occupancy. However, while there were significant decreases in non-residential and attempted non-residential burglary, these did not appear to be related to changes to activity patterns, but rather the lockdown phase. Conclusions: From a theoretical perspective, the results generally provide further support for routine activity perspective. From a practical perspective, they suggest considerations for anticipating future burglary trends. © 2022","Burglary; COVID-19; Guardianship; Household occupancy; Lockdown; Routine activities perspective","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141530928"

This study aimed to assess the extent of harmful alcohol use and associated socio-structural vulnerability factors among female sex workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a key population in the HIV epidemic. Data from a study of female sex workers initiating pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) recruited through respondent driven sampling were used. We assessed harmful alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) defined as having an AUDIT score ≥ 16. Associations between harmful alcohol use and socio-structural factors were assessed using logistic regression with marginal standardization. Of the 470 women recruited, more than one third (37.3%) had a drinking pattern suggestive of harmful alcohol use. Such use was independently associated with sex work-related mobility (aPR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11–1.61), arrest/incarceration (aPR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.27–1.84) and gender-based violence (aPR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.56). The high prevalence of harmful alcohol use and the interconnectedness with socio-structural factors indicate a need for a holistic programmatic approach to health for female sex workers. Programming should not solely direct attention to individual behavior but also include strategies aiming to address socio-structural vulnerabilities. © 2022 by the authors.","alcohol-related disorders; criminalization; gender-based violence; key population; sex work; sex work-related mobility; social epidemiology; Sub-Saharan Africa; substance abuse","Alcoholism; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Sex Workers; Tanzania; Dar es Salaam [Tanzania]; Tanzania; alcohol consumption; drinking; epidemiology; human immunodeficiency virus; prostitution; violence; womens employment; adult; alcohol consumption; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; alcoholism; Article; creatinine blood level; creatinine clearance; data analysis; demographics; drinking behavior; epidemic; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; low risk population; mortality; outcome assessment; pre-exposure prophylaxis; prevalence; quasi experimental study; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; sex worker; social aspect; social mobility; social status; social vulnerability; Tanzania; young adult; Human immunodeficiency virus infection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145972292"

Previous studies have shown that there are frequent cases of robberies and thefts in the streets, and the street network pattern and routine activity subjects are both related to crime. However, there are few in-depth explorations of such a relationship. Based on the police patrol area unit of the original DP District of HS City, this paper has adopted spatial analysis and statistical analysis methods to analyze the road network data, demographic data, mobile phone signaling data and other relevant data in order to explore the relationship between crime and street morphological characteristics including geometric and topological form, the relationship between crime and routine activity subjects including dynamic population and static population, and the impact of the street network on robberies and thefts. The results have shown that the factors affecting thefts and robberies in the street network are quite different. The factors affecting the theft crime are more complex. ""X-cell"" street network, road network density, road network permeability of low-speed traffic, static population density and dynamic population density all have an important impact on thefts. Only the branch density has a negative effect, and the rest of the factors have a positive effect. ""T-cell"" street network, density of actual residents and migrants in static population are related to robberies. But the street network pattern has not shown a significant correlation with robberies. In general, the street networks with more main roads, better accessibility, higher population density, and higher population mobility are prone to thefts. The street networks with many migrants are prone to the robberies. In addition, the findings of this study can also make certain extensions to the crime pattern theory. Since the accessibility of street network often brings risks, it is proposed at the end of the paper that it is imperative to consider how to reduce the crime risks as much as possible by regulating or improving the overall spatial environment of street network during the planning and construction of a safe street network environment in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

To understand the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of their impact on theft is the core content of CPTED and crime geography. This paper focuses on the progress on the link between UME and theft, systematically sorts out the characteristics of UME that affect the spatio-temporal differentiation of theft, and summarizes the measurements of UME. Overall, four issues need to be addressed urgently: (1) At present, the ambient population variables calculated by using mobile phone data are mainly population size and mobility, while the micro-social environment has not been precisely depicted by population′s demographic attributes and social regularity. (2) There is a lack of systematic research on the integration of micro-social and built environment, which may lead to pseudo-correlation or irrelevance. (3) The localized empirical research of Western criminological theories is not sufficient, and the theoretical connotation and concept are often difficult to be operated locally. The local knowledge generated by Chinese empirical research is somewhat complementary and challenging to Western criminological theories, but needs to be further ""conceptualized internationally"". (4) Street view has been used for virtual audit of micro-built environment, but randomly selecting audit sites lacks pertinence, because it paid no heed to the spatial variation of micro-social environment. Four avenues can be proposed for future research: (1) Cooperating with the public security department, employing sensitive data to measure micro-scale population attributes and social regularity, expanding the extension of the concept of ""population at risk"", and accurately reflecting the micro-social environment. Conducting theoretical and policy-oriented empirical research. (2) Coupling micro-social and micro-built environment, and analyzing the inter-embedding basis and coupling path of the two micro-environments from the multidimensional theoretical levels of society, environment, and behavior. Using ""big"" data to depict ""micro"" environment, and exploring the conditional interaction mechanism and scale dependence between the UME and theft. (3) Grasping the theoretical connotation of criminology, taking into account the social context of Chinese cities, and developing new possibilities for the local operationalization of the core concept of criminological theories. (4) Developing remote, virtual, automated and intelligent built environment observation methods based on street view, and paying attention to targeted sampling and systematic integration research. © 2022, Science Press.

Mobility data that measure individuals' movements over time in combination with sociostructural data (eg, crime, census) can potentially identify barriers and facilitators to HIV care engagement and can enhance public health surveillance and inform interventions. Methods and analysis The proposed work is a longitudinal observational cohort study aiming to enrol 400 Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals living with HIV in areas of the USA with high prevalence rates of HIV. Each participant will be asked to share at least 14 consecutive days of mobility data per month through the study app for 1 year and complete surveys at five time points (baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). The study app will collect Global Positioning System (GPS) data. These GPS data will be merged with other data sets containing information related to HIV care facilities, other healthcare, business and service locations, and sociostructural data. Machine learning and deep learning models will be used for data analysis to identify contextual predictors of HIV care engagement. The study includes interviews with stakeholders to evaluate the implementation and ethical concerns of using mobility data to increase engagement in HIV care. We seek to study the relationship between mobility patterns and HIV care engagement. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine (#20205923). Collected data will be deidentified and securely stored.

Though not new, the ideology appears to be manifesting in forms that are challenging to police or manage by security entities. This chapter explores the far-right movements and their intended goal which often makes mobilisation and violence inevitable and a common occurrence in Europe. It further reviews far-right activities in the onset and immediate global response to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak with the aim to identify patterns, target groups, and impacts of COVID-19 on far-right activities in Europe. A conceptual review of data, publications, and reports on far-right movements since 2020 points to overlapping interactions between hate crime and extreme violence following a period of far-right online mobilisation, driven by the mission to deliver varied forms of national outcomes. Findings reveal a correlation between COVID-19 and far-right movements, especially mobilisation for the ideology using different online platforms. Though less than anticipated attacks were carried out during the pandemic, the commitment to mobilise more adherents to the movements using COVID-19-specific conspiracies provides strong links geared towards events that could endanger the security and safety of the public. The implications for public security as a whole, and for European Union security policy and counter-terrorism, strategies are evaluated to highlight the limitations of current policy and strategies in preventing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 which appears to be a game-changing event in the world and for the far-right movements which used the pandemic to innovate. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Erman Akilli, Burak Güneş and Ahmet Gökbel.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174107396"

Data is required for training, testing, classification, and evaluation of the machine learning models. SMS Phishing (Smishing) is a binary classification problem in which messages are categorized as malicious (Smishing) or legitimate (Ham). It is a fraudulent activity in which the attacker sends a malicious text message to the Smartphone user that causes financial or personal loss to the victim. Few research works have been proposed for the identification of smishing messages. According to the literature survey conducted, the smishing dataset is not publicly available yet. Hence, we have composed a smishing dataset that contains smishing messages extracted from different internet sources. We have formulated a dataset of 5971 text messages that contain 638 smishing messages, 489 spam messages, and 4844 ham messages. This SMS Phishing dataset can be used for the extraction of smishing features and classification of text messages using Machine Learning Algorithms. Experimental evaluation of the dataset for smishing message categorization using keyword classification is also presented in this paper. This smishing dataset can be used as a baseline for future research work corresponding to SMS Phishing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cyber Security; Machine Learning; Mobile Phone Scam; Mobile Security; SMS Filtering; SMS Scam; Spam Messages; Text Classification","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mobile telecommunication systems; Text messaging; Text processing; Classification and evaluations; Cyber security; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mobile phone scam; Phishing; SMS filtering; SMS scam; Spam messages; Text classification; Mobile security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152575416"

This paper explores the effect of stay-at-home guidelines on thefts and robberies at the neighborhood level in a Latin American city. We exploit neighborhood heterogeneity in the ability of working adults to comply with stay-at-home recommendations and use difference-in-differences and event-study designs to identify the causal effect of COVID-19 mobility restrictions on the monthly number of thefts and robberies reported to police across neighborhoods in Montevideo (Uruguay) in 2020. Our results show that neighborhoods with a higher share of residents with work-from-home jobs experienced a larger reduction in reported thefts in relation to neighborhoods with a lower share of residents with work-from-home jobs. In contrast, both groups of neighborhoods experienced a similar reduction in the number of reported robberies.

However, few scholars have explored the difference of the impact of different housing types in different degrees of population mobility on burglary. This study takes ZG city, a coastal city in southeast China, as a research area. It is based on theories of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, rational choice theory and social disorganization theory. This paper, taking community as the unit of analysis, adopts data of burglary, the sixth national census and Point of Interest (POI). The spatial lagged negative binomial regression method is used to analyze the impact of the interaction between community population mobility and housing types on the spatial pattern of burglary. Among them, the population mobility factors were extracted based on the proportion of migrant population and the proportion of renting houses. The results show that population mobility has a significant positive impact on burglary rate. There is a significant positive effect of the proportion of owner-built housing on the rate of burglary, and the proportion of former public owned housing and commercial housing has a significant inhibitory effect on the burglary rate. In addition, the impact of affordable housing on burglary is not significant. The results of the interaction variables found that the interaction coefficients of population mobility with different types of housing variables are varied. Among them, the interaction of population mobility with self-built housing, affordable housing and former public housing has a significant promoting effect on burglary rate, indicating that the higher the degree of population mobility, the greater the impact of these three types of housing on burglary. Nevertheless, the interaction effect of population mobility and commercial housing is not significant. This study proves that population mobility can further mediate the effects of different types of housing on burglary, and suggests that we should pay attention to the impact of the degree of population mobility in the community where different types of housing are located when discussing the relationship between different types of housing and burglary. © 2022, Science Press.

However, as cities are under the intense pressure of increasing crime and scarce police resources, police patrols are expected to target more accurately at finer geographic units rather than ballpark “hot spot” areas. This study aims to develop an algorithm using geographic information to detect crime patterns at street level, the so-called “hot street”, to further assist the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in capturing crime change and transitive moments efficiently. The algorithm applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique onto street networks, rather than traditional areal units, in one case study borough in London; it then maps the detected crime “hot streets” by crime type. It was found that the algorithm could successfully generate “hot street” maps for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), enabling more effective allocation of police patrolling; and bear enough resilience itself for the Strategic Crime Analysis (SCA) team’s sustainable utilization, by either updating the inputs with latest data or modifying the model parameters (i.e. the kernel function, and the range of spillover). Moreover, this study explores contextual characteristics of crime “hot streets” by applying various regression models, in recognition of the best fitted Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, encompassing eight significant contextual factors with their varied effects on crimes at different streets. Having discussed the impact of lockdown on crime rates, it was apparent that the land-use driven mobility change during lockdown was a fundamental reason for changes in crime. Overall, these research findings have provided evidence and practical suggestions for crime prevention to local governors and policy practitioners, through more optimal urban planning (e.g. Low Traffic Neighborhoods), proactive policing (e.g. in the listed top 10 “Hot Streets” of crime), publicizing of laws and regulations, and installations of security infrastructures (e.g. CCTV cameras and traffic signals). © 2022 Wuhan University.

However, this approach is outdated in a globalized world with rapid transportation means, where humans easily move long distances across borders. Cross-border cooperation in solving cold-cases is rare due to political, administrative or technical challenges. It is fundamental to develop new tools to provide rapid and cost-effective leads for international cooperation. In this work, we demonstrate that isotopic measurements are effective screening tools to help identify cold-cases with potential international ramifications. We first complete existing databases of hydrogen and sulfur isotopes in human hair from residents across North America by compiling or analyzing hair from Canada, the United States (US) and Mexico. Using these databases, we develop maps predicting isotope variations in human hair across North America. We demonstrate that both δ2H and δ34S values of human hair are highly predictable and display strong spatial patterns. Multi-isotope analysis combined with dual δ2H and δ34S geographic probability maps provide evidence for international travel in two case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that multi-isotope analysis in bulk hair of deceased border crossers found in the US, close to the Mexico-US border, help trace their last place of residence or travel back to specific regions of Mexico. These findings were validated by the subsequent identification of these individuals through the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, Arizona. In the second case study, we demonstrate that sequential multi-isotope analysis along the hair strands of an unidentified individual found in Canada provides detailed insights into the international mobility of this individual during the last year of life. In both cases, isotope data provide strong leads towards international travel. © 2022 Bataille et al.","","Hair; Humans; Hydrogen; Isotopes; Potassium Iodide; Sulfur Isotopes; United States; hydrogen; sulfur; hydrogen; isotope; potassium iodide; sulfur; Article; cadaver identification; Canada; criminalistics; hair analysis; human; international cooperation; Interpol; isotope analysis; law enforcement; Mexico; undocumented immigrant; United States; chemistry; hair","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140814875"

With the data of China judicial documents network, using natural language technology of AI, combined with exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial econometric model, this paper systematically and deeply analyzes the spatial pattern and influencing factors of telecom-network fraud in China, based on the perspective of the source of crime. The research showed that: (1) The regional characteristics of the origin of the telecom network fraud are obvious, and the spatial pattern is“More in the north but less in the south, more in the east while less in the west, and more prominent in the middle”. Meanwhile, the spatial spillover effect is different between the south and the north. Hunan is the center of the south, and the spillover effect is outstanding. (2) The spatial choice of criminals is obviously different, the short-distance crime takes precedence over the medium- and long-distance crime, and the proportion of crimes in the province is much higher than that in other provinces. (3) Although telecom- network fraud is characterized by non- contact, but the criminals do not randomly choose the victims, instead they target at special victims. The spatial clustering of the crime occurrence is remarkable. The hot areas of criminal cases and the hot areas where criminals come from are highly overlapping, and the developed coastal cities have also become the hot areas of telecom network fraud. (4) The influencing factors of the spatial pattern of the origin of the telecom network fraud are different. Wage level, urbanization rate, education level, urban environment, urban administrative level have significant impacts on crime, but their mechanisms are different. Based on the macro- scale, this study provides empirical evidence and scientific reference for crime prevention and control. © 2023 Science Press.

More precisely, they can employ cell site simulators such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers to intercept and monitor mobile communications, enabling eavesdropping, tracking individuals' movements, and potentially coordinating illegal activities while evading detection by law enforcement agencies. To overcome this issue, an innovative approach to detect IMSI catchers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models is proposed. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the developed models process multivariate time series data to distinguish suspicious patterns indicative of IMSI catcher presence. This work compares nine different model architectures based on CNN, LSTM, or a combination of both through a series of case studies. We demonstrate that LSTM-based and Parallel CNNLSTM models outperform other architectures, achieving high precision and recall rates. Then, the best two models are tested with several sequence lengths. The presented models serve as valuable tools, providing a further enhancement to the security of mobile networks.

Yet, graffiti is not only an interest of graffiti writers, but of numerous social agents and institutions too, including art dealers, museums, policy makers, academic scholars, journalists, law enforcement agencies and various corporate actors. As a result, the imageries of graffiti writing are bound up with a range of practices, each with its own scope and logic. This chapter taps into some of them. It engages with graffiti as image and practice before proceeding to discuss the suppression and commodification of graffiti writing, as well as the patterns of mobility and permanence in which graffiti often is encapsulated.

In the last decade, India has seen rapid growth in the field of mobile communication as it is continuously increasing at an exponential rate, the availability of cheap data and availability of economical rate of calling encourages users to make calls easily and this continuous calling within a certain group creates a network considering relationship a parameter. The use of existing models of rapid data mining on mobile phone call logs / call data records (CDR)establishes a new dimension in the field of a user's social behavior. Meanwhile, it makes a possible methodology of suspect detection based on certain attributes i.e., cell phone conversation ratio, calling pattern among users, terrain-basedfacts, etc. In this paper, key areas which have been covered are 'Machine's perception towards prediction of complex social systems and strange behavior of cell phone user' based on data mining techniques applied on call details of cell phone users. © 2023 IEEE.","Call Data Mining; Call Log Analysis; Mobile Call Forensic; Suspect Prediction","Cellular telephones; Crime; Data mining; Digital forensics; Machine Perception; Mobile telecommunication systems; Pattern recognition; Social aspects; Social behavior; Activity patterns; Activity recognition; Call data mining; Call log analyse; Cell phone; Log analysis; Mobile call forensic; Mobile calls; Suspect prediction; User activity; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173869785"

While most extant studies investigate preparedness patterns based on survey data, this study explores the potential of big digital footprint data (i.e. population visits to points of interest (POI)) to investigate preparedness patterns in the real case of Hurricane Ida (2021). We further investigate income and racial inequality in preparedness by combining the digital footprint data with demographic and socioeconomic data. A clear pattern of preparedness was seen in Louisiana with aggregated visits to grocery stores, gasoline stations, and construction supply dealers increasing by nearly 9%, 12%, and 10% respectively, representing three types of preparedness: survival, mobility planning, and hazard mitigation. Preparedness for Hurricane Ida was not seen in New York and New Jersey states. Inequality analyses for Louisiana across census block groups (CBGs) demonstrate that CBGs with higher income have more (nearly 8% greater) preparedness in visiting gasoline stations, while CBGs with a larger percentage of the white population have more preparedness in visiting grocery stores (nearly 12% more) in the lowest income groups. The results indicate that income and racial inequality differ across different preparedness in terms of visiting different POIs. © 2023 The Author(s).

To uncover the determinants of willingness to share (WTS), prior studies typically relied on either individual-level survey-based or aggregate-level data-driven methods. To combine the former's strength in capturing individual choice preferences and the latter's advantage in utilising available multi-source big data, this study proposes a big data approach to modelling individual choices between the solo and shared options for each trip. To reconstruct the choice process, we leverage large-scale real-world trip records and propose a learning framework to not only retrieve the trip time and fare of the chosen option (solo or shared), but also impute the likely time and fare of the alternative option. These reconstructed trip attributes are then integrated with the sociodemographic, built environment and traffic features from other data sources. Finally, all these variables are fed into a random coefficient logit model to reveal passengers’ ridesplitting preferences. Through a case study of Manhattan, New York City, we reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of WTS and its determinants. Results show that WTS varies greatly across space and time. The time-fare trade-off is identified as the most essential factor, with the value of time revealed to be about $28-36/h. WTS decreases with longer trip distance/commuting time/distance to the urban centre, lower road speed, and higher speed fluctuation/bus station/crime density, but increases with a higher proportion of middle-class/female/young residents, residential land use and metro station. The proposed methodology can be used to explain and monitor WTS in a cost-effective way, complementing traditional survey-based methods to better design and promote ridesplitting services. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete choice modelling; Ridesplitting; Shared mobility; Spatiotemporal analysis; Willingness to share","Kansas; Manhattan; United States; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Land use; Subway stations; Data-driven methods; Discrete choice models; Individual choice; Individual levels; Ride-through; Ridesplitting; Shared mobility; Spatiotemporal analysis; Sustainable transportation; Willingness to share; commuting; discrete choice analysis; mobility; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; transportation development; transportation system; Big data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173617217"

Analyzing Gaspar through three spatial optics, this paper considers the novel's global influences, the elements that fall into relief as local in translation, and - by attending to patterns of movement and contact that complicate place-based perspectives - the archipelagic qualities of the text. By imagining this alternative conception of literary space, Armandio's novel recasts the contemporary global novel as the product of contact, mobility, and linguistic and material flows rather than sites of static national or regional identity. © Lara Norgaard, 2023.","crime fiction; Indonesian literature; relational turn; translation studies; world literature","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170697712"

In order to overcome this problem, a novel intelligent pattern lock detector is presented in this research. The proposed lock detector uses transfer learning to extract deep lightweight features, iterative feature chosen function and a shallow classifier. A feature extraction network has been created by using SqueezeNet and MobileNet-V2, which are among the deep learning architectures in this work. Iterative Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (ImRMR) was used for feature selection. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was selected for the classifier. The proposed model has been developed on three image datasets.

We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender - Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This can be accomplished by looking at traffic network activity, but it takes a lot of work. The NIDS heavily utilizes approaches for data extraction and machine learning to find anomalies. In terms of feature selection, NIDS is far more effective. This is accurate since anomaly identification uses a number of time-consuming features. Because of this, the feature selection method influences how long it takes to analyze movement patterns and how clear it is. The goal of the study is to provide NIDS with an attribute selection approach. PSO has been used for that purpose. The Network Intrusion Detection System that is being developed will be able to identify any malicious activity in the network or any unusual behavior in the network, allowing the identification of the illegal activities and safeguarding the enormous amounts of confidential data belonging to the customers from being compromised. In the research, datasets were produced utilising both a network infrastructure and a simulation network. Wireshark is used to gather data packets whereas Cisco Packet Tracer is used to build a network in a simulated environment. Additionally, a physical network consisting of six node MCUs connected to a laptop and a mobile hotspot, has been built and communication packets are being recorded using the Wireshark tool. To train several machine learning models, all the datasets that were gathered—created datasets from our own studies as well as some common datasets like NSDL and UNSW acquired from Kaggle—were employed. Additionally, PSO, which is an optimization method, has been used with these ML algorithms for feature selection. In the research, KNN, decision trees, and ANN have all been combined with PSO for a specific case study.

It argues that collective responses to crises can be a way for diasporas to actively make themselves visible, allowing them to positively shape external perceptions instead of being forced into a negative form of visibility through, in the case of the Vietnamese, associations with crime, human trafficking and illegal migration. Data are drawn from Facebook pages by and for Vietnamese people in the UK, and specifically how they were used as platforms to mobilise philanthropic action. The analysis will show how semiotic practices can simultaneously index multiple layers of social meanings and that differential access to the resources required for participation in those practices leads to complex patterns of inclusion and exclusion. Despite the different levels of participation in those practices, and thus different degrees of belonging, the participants are shown to be united around a shared orientation around the events of the crisis and the philanthropic response. This imagined simultaneous experience of a crisis in turn serves to temporarily transcend multiple internal divisions for a collective response. © 2023 Julia Gspandl, Christina Korb, Angelika Heiling, Elizabeth J.

Due to the accessibility of smartphones, many teenagers are 'online' for significant hours in a day. Many middle and high school students have been victims of a cybercrime through online activities. Additionally, various incidents of Internet fraud have been reported where teenagers are persuaded to buy games, music, and videos without realizing they are falling for a scam or disclosing their credit card information. Studies have shown that implementing a successful security awareness camp is crucial in boosting cybersecurity and attracting talent to this domain. This paper discusses our efforts on creating smartphone apps in the context of cyber-security to encourage safe use of apps and raise awareness among teenagers. The strategy used is to develop apps with the intention of closing security gaps. By doing this, teenagers gain a wealth of information about cybersecurity. This work aims to develop students' problem-solving skills and create a cybersecurity mindset for dealing with real-world cybersecurity-related problems such as malware or phishing assaults and to promote interest in cybersecurity careers among high school students utilizing smartphone-based interactive learning modules.

However, the literature has taken it as a homogenous group and seldom explored the varied impacts of different kinds of ambient populations on thefts. To fill this gap, supported by mobile phone trajectory data, this research investigated the relationship between ambient populations of different social groups and theft in a major city in China. With the control variables of motivated offenders and guardianship, spatial-lag negative binominal models were built to explore the effects of the ambient populations of different social groups on the distribution of theft. The results found that the influences of ambient populations of different social groups on the spatial distribution of theft are different. Accounting for the difference in the “risk–benefit” characteristics among different activity groups to the offenders, individuals from the migrant population are the most likely to be potential victims, followed by suburban and middle-income groups, while college, affluent, and affordable housing populations are the least likely. The local elderly population had no significant impact. This research has further enriched the studies of time geography and deepened routine activity theory. It suggests that the focus of crime prevention and control strategies developed by police departments should shift from the residential space to the activity space. © 2022 by the authors.","activity space; ambient population; mobile trajectory; routine activity theory; social areas; theft from the person","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144878302"

Computer vision problems now find application in all spheres of the digital world ranging from a normal person’s routine mobile face ID login to institutional facial attendance system to national security-based software to identify criminals. The proposed work examines the performance of face reorganization model using CNN with SVM classifier. Two phases are involved in the creation of the facial recognition system. The first stage involves picking up or extracting facial features, while the second step involves pattern classification. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has made significant strides in FR technology in recent years but most of the existing models considered only one or two parameters but the proposed work computed all important performance parameters, i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Further, the time required to train the model and its prediction time are also computed in this study.

A significant type of photometric distortion that notably reduces the quality of a fingerphoto is the blurring of the image. This paper proposes a deep fingerphoto deblurring model to restore the ridge information degraded by the image blurring. As the core of our model, we utilize a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn the distribution of natural ridge patterns. We perform several modifications to enhance the quality of the reconstructed (deblurred) fingerphotos by our proposed model. First, we develop a multi-stage GAN to learn the ridge distribution in a coarse-to-fine framework. This framework enables the model to maintain the consistency of the ridge deblurring process at different resolutions. Second, we propose a guided attention module that helps the generator to focus mainly on blurred regions. Third, we incorporate a deep fingerphoto verifier as an auxiliary adaptive loss function to force the generator to preserve the ID information during the deblurring process. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on multiple public fingerphoto datasets as well as real-world blurred fingerphotos. In particular, our method achieves 5.2 dB, 8.7%, and 7.6% improvement in PSNR, AUC, and EER, respectively, compared to a state-of-the-art deblurring method.  © 2013 IEEE.","Biometrics; contactless fingerprints; fingerphoto deblurring; generative adversarial networks; guided attention; multi-stage generative architecture","Cameras; Computer vision; Image enhancement; Job analysis; Quality control; Contact less; Contactless fingerprint; Deblurring; Fingerphoto deblurring; Fingerprint Recognition; Generator; Guided attention; Kernel; Multi-stage generative architecture; Multi-stages; Task analysis; Generative adversarial networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166773058"

Under the umbrella of the crime opportunity theory, that suggests that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based short-term crime models. Researchers have used call detail records (CDR), data from location-based services such as Foursquare or from social media to characterize human mobility; and have shown that mobility metrics, together with historical crime data, can improve short-term crime prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose to use a publicly available fine-grained human mobility dataset from a location intelligence company to explore the effects of human mobility features on short-term crime prediction. For that purpose, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, different types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we show that adding human mobility flow features to historical crimes can improve the F1 scores for a variety of neural crime prediction models across cities and types of crimes, with improvements ranging from 2% to 7%.

The modus operandi of cyberattack campaigns was revealed by analyzing and considering cyberattacks in the context of major world events. Following what appeared to be substantial gaps between the initial breakout of the virus and the first COVID-19-related cyber-attack, the investigation indicates how attacks became significantly more frequent over time, to the point where three or four different cyber-attacks were reported on certain days. This study contributes in the direction of fifteen types of cyber-attacks which were identified as the most common pattern and its ensuing devastating events during the global COVID-19 crisis. The paper is unique because it covered the main types of cyber-attacks that most organizations are currently facing and how to address them. An intense look into the recent advances that cybercriminals leverage, the dynamism, calculated measures to tackle it, and never-explored perspectives are some of the integral parts which make this review different from other present reviewed papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a robust response to the objective used for the study. Using a multi-criteria decision-making problem-solving technique, many facets of cybersecurity that have been affected during the pandemic were then quantitatively ranked in ascending order of severity. The data was generated between March 2020 and December 2021, from a global survey through online contact and responses, especially from different organizations and business executives. The result show differences in cyber-attack techniques; as hacking attacks was the most frequent with a record of 330 out of 895 attacks, accounting for 37%. Next was Spam emails attack with 13%; emails with 13%; followed by malicious domains with 9%. Mobile apps followed with 8%, Phishing was 7%, Malware 7%, Browsing apps with 6%, DDoS has 6%, Website apps with 6%, and MSMM with 6%. BEC frequency was 4%, Ransomware with 2%, Botnet scored 2% and APT recorded 1%. The study recommends that it will continue to be necessary for governments and organizations to be resilient and innovative in cybersecurity decisions to overcome the current and future effects of the pandemic or similar crisis, which could be long-lasting. Hence, this study's findings will guide the creation, development, and implementation of more secure systems to safeguard people from cyber-attacks. © 2022 The Author(s)","Business security; COVID-19 and organization cybersecurity challenges; Cybersecurity; Cyberspace future; Economic disruption; Internet security; Trending insight of cyber-attack","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136652942"

Herein, we rationally designed and prepared a new NIR-emissive composite material composed of an NIR fluorophore, i.e., (E)-4-(7-(4-bromophenyl)imino) methyl)benzo[C][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (BrBTN), and porous starch through a simple grinding method. The BrBTN powder exhibited strong NIR emission with a high quantum yield of 0.209. Porous starch enabled high adsorption ability for fingerprints. Using the BrBTN@starch composite, clear images of the tertiary structure of a fingerprint with NIR emission on various substrates were obtained under 405 nm light excitation within 10 s using a mobile phone alone after a simple dust removal treatment. Benefiting from its strong NIR emission and high selectivity, the imaging resolution of the fingerprint fluorescent patterns based on the NIR composite was 3-times higher than that of commercial fingerprint powder. This work provides a novel strategy for the design of highly emissive NIR fingerprint powder with the advantages of reduced background fluorescence, easy operation, high photostability, low cost and low toxicity to developers, indicating its great potential in the field of trace inspection and biological imaging. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Costs; Fluorophores; Starch; Forensic identification; High selectivity; Latent fingerprint; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Near-infrared emissions; Organic fluorophores; Porous starches; Simple++; Starch-based; Infrared devices","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141557774"

Such an amount of information is analyzed to discover data-driven models, which can be exploited to tackle the major issues that cities face, including air pollution, virus diffusion, human mobility, crime forecasting, traffic flows, etc. In particular, the detection of city hotspots is de facto a valuable organization technique for framing detailed knowledge of a metropolitan area, providing high-level summaries for spatial datasets, which are a valuable support for planners, scientists, and policymakers. However, while classic density-based clustering algorithms show to be suitable for discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. In fact, a proper threshold setting is very difficult when clusters in different regions have considerably different densities, or clusters with different density levels are nested. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are heavily characterized by variable densities, multi-density clustering seems to be more appropriate for discovering city hotspots. Indeed, such algorithms rely on multiple minimum threshold values and are able to detect multiple pattern distributions of different densities, aiming at distinguishing between several density regions, which may or may not be nested and are generally of a non-convex shape. This paper discusses the research issues and challenges for analyzing urban data, aimed at discovering multi-density hotspots in urban areas. In particular, the study compares the four approaches (DBSCAN, OPTICS-xi, HDBSCAN, and CHD) proposed in the literature for clustering urban data and analyzes their performance on both state-of-the-art and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that multi-density clustering algorithms generally achieve better results on urban data than classic density-based algorithms. © 2023 by the authors.","density-based clustering; multi-density city hotspots detection; smart city; urban data analysis","Clustering algorithms; Viruses; Density clustering; Density-based Clustering; Different densities; Hotspot detections; Hotspots; Large-scales; Multi-density city hotspot detection; Network devices; Sensing networks; Urban data analyse; Smart city","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151097475"

Recent migration dynamics in South America have been marked by intra-regional and extra-regional mobility patterns. While such intra-regional movements have had as their destination mainly countries of the Southern Cone-such as Argentina, Chile and Brazil-recent mobility has also changed migration patterns in countries such as Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. In particular, the exodus of more than seven million Venezuelans has led to significant changes in migration flows and policies in the region. This chapter reflects on the changes in migration governance in South America in the last decade, and how it has been framed and justified through the lens of ""multiple crises"". The chapter argues that South America has been developing a patchwork approach to migration governance, characterised by fragmented and reactive measures, with practices that evidence both continuity and change. The development of this approach is leading to more control, the criminalisation of migration, increased migrant irregularity and less protection for people on the move. © The Author(s) 2024.

Based on the case data of child trafficking crime on the website of Chinese Judicial Documents, this study examines the spatiotemporal pattern and criminal decision-making mechanism of offense of selling offspring. The results are as follows: (1) Sold children are characterized by ""younger age, "" most of them are zero-year-old infants, and males are far more represented than females. Most sellers are young and middle-aged men or young women, mainly unemployed, farmers and workers. They sell their offspring to buyers with strong demand through social networks of acquaintances, special occupational groups, traffickers, network media, or persuasion by buyers/intermediaries. The reasons for selling include economic difficulties, out of wedlock birth, extra births, intermediary solicitation, debt repayment. (2) Temporally, the annual change of crime can be divided into three stages: stable sequence and low incidence, rapid growth and sustained high incidence, and steady decline, which are mainly affected by China's population policy, action on combating trafficking, and the development of the website of Chinese Judicial Documents. The monthly change presents a synchronous trend on the birth and betrayal time of the children, with spring and summer being more represented than autumn and winter. (3) Spatially, the origin region of selling presents the pattern of ""three sources"" with ""Sichuan-Shandong-Fujian"" as the core, and the destination region of selling presents the pattern of ""North-South two sinks"" with ""Shandong-Fujian"" as the core on the macro level. Microscopically, it occurs in closed spaces with a frequent flow of people, and residential buildings and open spaces with a frequent flow of people. The overall trafficking path is ""inter-provincial flowing out from the southwest source area and intra-provincial flow of the South-North sink area. "" Inter-provincial migration is mostly driven by interests and is dominated by trafficking criminal groups, while intra-provincial migration is mostly formed by temporary one-time gang crimes to meet the needs of buying and selling. (4) Based on the theory of rational choice, this study constructs a decision-making framework for the offense of selling offspring, and finds that the crime is mainly affected by the comprehensive influence of background factors, previous experience, and situational induction, and the bounded rational choice made by potential criminals under the decision-making evaluation of ""benefit-cost-risk. "" After deciding to sell their children, potential criminals will choose the appropriate time, place, and way to maximize interests. © Starobulgarska Literatura 2022.","benefit-cost-risk; criminal decision-making mechanism; offense of selling offspring; sold children; trafficking route","China; child care; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; trafficking; trend analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143625208"

This modality is applied in a wide range of applications, such as criminal investigations and identification systems, since it can be performed at a long distance and requires no cooperation of interests. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition systems, and previous studies have utilized depth information captured by RGB-D cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect. In recent years, multi-layer LiDAR sensors, which can obtain range images of a target at a range of over 100 m in real time, have attracted significant attention in the field of autonomous mobile robots and self-driving vehicles. Compared with general cameras, LiDAR sensors have rarely been used for biometrics due to the low point cloud densities captured at long distances. In this study, we focus on improving the robustness of gait recognition using LiDAR sensors under confounding conditions, specifically addressing the challenges posed by viewing angles and measurement distances. First, our recognition model employs a two-scale spatial resolution to enhance immunity to varying point cloud densities. In addition, this method learns the gait features from two invariant viewpoints (i.e., left-side and back views) generated by estimating the walking direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention block that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise weights to fuse the features from the aforementioned resolutions and viewpoints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-view, cross-distance challenges, and practical scenarios.  © 2023 The Authors.","3D point cloud; attention mechanism; convolutional neural networks; Gait recognition; LiDAR","Biometrics; Gait analysis; Image resolution; Neural networks; Optical radar; Three dimensional displays; 3D point cloud; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural network; Gait recognition; LiDAR; Point cloud compression; Point-clouds; Shape; Spatial resolution; Three-dimensional display; Cameras","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177052673"

Empirical analyses of segregation are typically conducted at the macro-level as well, explaining changes and variations in segregation through contextual-level factors such as population size, region, or percent White. However, there is an established body of literature that recognizes segregation as an outcome of micro-level processes of locational attainments and residential mobility that considers the role of household characteristics like income, education, and nativity. This work is fundamentally important for testing the dominant theoretical frameworks employed in segregation research, which largely emphasize that segregation is driven by micro-level characteristics and processes and center the barriers and opportunities in residential mobility. Additionally, the locational attainments approach can be linked with outcomes that are essentially consequences of segregation such as educational disparities, health disparities, and unequal exposure to crime. While both levels of analyses are important, a fundamental link between them has been missing which could explicate how locational attainments directly produce residential segregation patterns. In this final empirical chapter, we draw on Fossett’s (2017) difference-of-means approach to calculating segregation indices to establish a direct quantitative link between predicted outcomes from household-level locational attainment models and overall residential segregation outcomes at the community level. This approach opens up a new toolbox of methods that are popular in inequality studies, including regression standardization and decomposition, which allow us to analyze residential segregation as a stratification outcome. We perform this analysis on 25 metropolitan areas with a focus on White-Black, White-Latino, and White-Asian residential segregation in 2010. We find that White-Black segregation is largely attributable to differences in rates of return on resources relevant for locational attainments, while White-Latino and White-Asian segregation can be explained more by group differences in characteristics and resources such as income and nativity. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170222169"

The paper aims to identify the determinants of the success of the revolutionary movement in the events of 1917. The author focuses on the mechanisms of communication of political prisoners and the role of the emotional component in the formation of a stable system of social interaction in a revolutionary environment. Employing the methodology of the history of emotions and comparative analysis, the author studies both previously known historical sources (letters of F. E. Dzerzhinsky) and archival materials (perlustration of letters from prisoners of the Smolensk convict prison) which have not been studied before. The article demonstrates how the special conditions of imprisonment shaped the emotional regime of hard labour prisons and contributed to the formation of a revolutionary community. With classical communication mechanisms limited, prisoners developed alternative means of communication. Also, the author pays special attention to the peculiarities of the written language of political prisoners and its evolution in conditions of hard labour and interaction with the criminal environment. The main results of the study are related to the term “emotional code” as a characteristic communication mechanism (“friend or foe” system) within a revolutionary community. In the context of the social processes of the beginning of the century, the opposition to the growing social melancholy on the part of the revolutionary community stands out. It was not only able to build communication mechanisms that were reliable and closed to external analysis based on similar emotional patterns but also used emotional constructions for agitation and propaganda in the public environment. Specific images of the future and the positive emotions associated with it have become a constructive alternative to the negative phenomena that prevail in the public consciousness during the last years of the empire’s existence. The main “weapon” of the revolutionary community in 1917, along with propaganda, was empathy, highly developed emotional intelligence, and the ability to accurately capture the emotions of one’s surroundings. The article concludes that labour prisons were “laboratories of emotions” which played a significant role in the crystallisation of the revolutionary community and the formation of its mobilisation potential. © 2023 Ural Federal University.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of these middlebox services that needs to be deployed in the cloud. However, with the growth of network attacks, redirecting enterprise traffic to external middleboxes inevitably raises new concerns related to packet content security and unauthorized access to the ruleset used for detection. To address these concerns, many research efforts targeted the design and development of IDS that operate over encrypted traffic (secure IDS) by looking for ways to make matching possible over encrypted data (aka secure/encrypted pattern matching) without any leakage while maintaining the same level of efficiency. However, most of the existing designs are communication inefficient and too slow to be deployed to support 5G network traffic that requires high throughput. Furthermore, the majority of real network traffic is legitimate and needs to be filtered quickly. Therefore, in order to improve the inspection delay, we propose in this paper a fast and efficient secure IDS that performs detection over encrypted network traffic based on the Searchable Encryption (SE) class of methods using a two-layer architecture in which the first layer is used to quickly filter out the majority of legitimate traffic and the second layer is used to further inspect only unfiltered malicious traffic. We implemented our solution and a recent powerful secure IDS and showed how our approach provides better results and outperforms it. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Homomorphic encryption; Intrusion detection; Searchable encryption; Secure middlebox; Secure pattern matching; Signature-Based detection","5G mobile communication systems; Computer crime; Cryptography; Network function virtualization; Network security; Pattern matching; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Intrusion-Detection; Middleboxes; Network traffic; Pattern-matching; Searchable encryptions; Secure middlebox; Secure pattern matching; Signature based detections; Intrusion detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152546723"

In the (cyber-)social ecosystem characterized by the centrality of a new dimension of human experience that goes beyond the internet and social media, the Left-Wing Extremism and Violent Left-Wing and Anarchist Extremism (VLWAE) constitute an important challenge for security. The author provides guidelines for conducting online research on Left-Wing Extremism entities using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), while ensuring digital hygiene and safety, to study their online activities, propaganda, and radicalization strategies. OSINT enables researchers to collect information from various sources, including private and encrypted messaging channels, to understand the organization and mobilization of extremist campaigns. The use of various tools and techniques is presented to highlight the most relevant elements that should be included in a research report on left-wing extremism target. The author also focuses on the importance of technological innovation to support research in this field. Moreover, a strong integration between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and OSINT is revolutionizing online investigations of left-wing extremism and other forms of extremism and terrorism. AI-based technology allows researchers to analyze large amounts of images, videos, and data with the aim for identifying patterns and trends.

The ubiquitous utility of Android mobile devices is a perfect example. Android mobile devices store many user data in the memory, and these data could be critical to forensics investigations. Among the data that can be acquired from Android mobile devices, user operations are one of the most important pieces of evidence. They can tell what a suspect or a victim was doing with their mobile devices. However, there is a lack of effective techniques that can help forensics investigators extract user operations from Android mobile devices and reconstruct user operation state models with timestamps. In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically identifies user operations from Android mobile devices' event logs and constructs a timestamped state model. First, we extract system logs relevant to the Android activity lifecycle. Then, we identify patterns in Android activity lifecycle in the logs and investigate the relationship between these lifecycle patterns and actual user operations. After that, we reconstruct user operations into timestamped state models. Using an experimental evaluation with ten real-world Android applications, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively reconstruct timestamped state models, by achieving a mean of 100% activity coverage, a mean of 94.3% user operation coverage, and a mean of 95.5% state model coverage. © 2023 IEEE.","Android Forensics; Digital Forensics; Times-tamped State Model","Android (operating system); Behavioral research; Electronic crime countermeasures; Life cycle; Android activities; Android forensics; Forensic investigation; Forensics investigators; Mobile device users; Mobile Technology; State models; Time-tamped state model; User behaviors; User data; Digital forensics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168863757"

This spending pattern has caused an increase in fraud, making it the most significant revenue leakage in telecommunications, where the leading fraud type is subscription fraud. Subscription fraud has a direct negative impact on the company’s revenue, bonuses of employees, and customers’ credit status. Although the current fraud systems can detect subscription fraud, they cannot identify the fraudster. This enables the fraudster to commit fraud using the same or multiple identity documents during the contract application process without being detected. In trying to change the spending pattern and prevent subscription fraud, we sought to determine the impact of subscription fraud in mobile telecommunication companies. We designed, developed, and implemented a Multimodal Biometrics System (MBS) using Python, SQLite3, and JavaScript to enable telecommunication companies to capture and store customer faces and fingerprints to use them for verification before approving the contract. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimension of the face and fingerprint images. PCA outperformed Independent Component Analysis and Linear Discriminate Analysis algorithms. To do image matching, we used the PCA-based representation for local features (PCA-SIFT) algorithm, which outperformed Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (OBR) algorithms. MBS results gave us biometric matching accuracy of 94.84%. MBS is easy to implement and cost-effective. The system can help identify the fraudster, prevent subscription fraud and reduce revenue leakage. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Biometrics; Face Biometrics; Fingerprint; Multimodal Biometrics System; PCA Algorithm; Subscription Fraud; Telecommunication","Biometrics; Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Crime; Face recognition; Sales; Face biometrics; Fingerprint; Fraud prevention; Fraudsters; Multimodal biometric systems; Principal components analysis algorithms; Revenue leakage; Spending patterns; Subscription fraud; Telecommunication companies; Principal component analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169691186"

Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer.

This technique combines two highly efficient and robust procedures: phiC31 integrase–mediated site-specific integration and homing endonuclease–mediated resolution of local duplications. In this technique, a donor fragment containing the desired mutation(s) is first integrated into a selected attP site near the target locus by phiC31 integrase–mediated site-specific integration, which creates local duplications consisting of the mutant-containing donor fragment and the wild-type target locus. Next, homing endonuclease–induced double-stranded DNA breaks trigger recombination between the duplications and resolve the target locus to generate scarless mutant alleles. In every step, the desired flies can be easily identified by patterns of dominant markers, so no large-scale screens are needed. This technique is highly efficient and can be used to generate scarless point mutations, insertions, and deletions. The availability of large libraries of mapped attP site–containing transposon/CRISPR insertions in Drosophila allows the modification of more than half of the euchromatic Drosophila genome at a high efficiency. As more and more attP-containing insertions are generated and mapped, this technique will be able to modify larger portions of the Drosophila genome.

Child kidnapping is a serious offence, and it is increasing with rapid rate. Safety of a child is always a matter of concern of parents as well as school authorities. In this paper, statistical analysis of dataset of child kidnapping with different parameters such as age, gender, race, height and weight are discussed. Supervised machine learning algorithms is used to identify the pattern of abduction done by family member or outside the family. The classifier received the accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, Internet of Things based system is also proposed that will monitor the location of the child whenever child enters or exits in the school vehicle. The proposed system is designed with Arduino microcontroller, RFID reader, GSM module, GPS module, PIR sensor, and Piezo Buzzer. The system gets triggered when child enters or exits in the school vehicle and RFID tags are read that are fixed on the shoe of child. The proposed system is tested with 10 students at different time with different geographical locations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Child; Decision tree; IoT; RFID","Crime; Global system for mobile communications; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Child; Child safety; Geographical locations; IoT; Machine learning algorithms; Rapid rate; RFID readers; RFID-tag; Supervised machine learning; Decision trees","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138779644"

Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period.

Subsequently, migration has become increasingly important within the research field. While this development has led to new findings regarding women's participation in crime in early modern metropolises, in contrast, little is known about prosecuting patterns in smaller urban centers in predominantly rural regions. This situation is particularly true for less urbanized territories, such as the geographical area of the Swiss Confederation. It is often assumed that women in big cities led more mobile and independent lives than their counterparts in smaller towns. This socio-economic difference in female profiles is used as the main explanation for the disparities in gendered patterns in the registration of criminality. By analyzing the records of the criminal court of seventeenth-century Protestant Bern, this article aims to contribute to the understanding of women's crime in early modern urban territories. The findings demonstrate that smaller towns could also show high levels of female defendants. However, the city of Bern was not a place of relative freedom for women. Rather, the opposite is true: the authorities' control, focusing on an ordered society and household, led to strong formal control of mobility and (im)morality, which had a lasting impact on the prosecution of women. This policy, the article argues, is the main explanation for the high percentage of recorded female delinquency. © 2023 Netherlands Institute of International Relations.

Despite these advancements, phone calls and text messages still make up the largest proportion of mobile data usage. It is possible to study human communication behaviors and mobility patterns using the useful information that mobile phone data provide. Specifically, the digital traces left by the large number of mobile devices provide important information that facilitates a deeper understanding of human behavior and mobility configurations for researchers in various fields, such as criminology, urban sensing, transportation planning, and healthcare. Mobile phone data record significant spatiotemporal (i.e., geospatial and time-related data) and communication (i.e., call) information. These can be used to achieve different research objectives and form the basis of various practical applications, including human mobility models based on spatiotemporal interactions, real-time identification of criminal activities, inference of friendship interactions, and density distribution estimation. The present research primarily reviews studies that have employed mobile phone data to investigate, assess, and predict human communication and mobility patterns in the context of crime prevention. These investigations have sought, for example, to detect suspicious activities, identify criminal networks, and predict crime, as well as understand human communication and mobility patterns in urban sensing applications. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted on crime research studies that were published between 2014 and 2022 and listed in eight electronic databases. In this review, we evaluated the most advanced methods and techniques used in recent criminology applications based on mobile phone data and the benefits of using this information to predict crime and detect suspected criminals. The results of this literature review contribute to improving the existing understanding of where and how populations live and socialize and how to classify individuals based on their mobility patterns. The results show extraordinary growth in studies that utilized mobile phone data to study human mobility and movement patterns compared to studies that used the data to infer communication behaviors. This observation can be attributed to privacy concerns related to acquiring call detail records (CDRs). Additionally, most of the studies used census and survey data for data validation. The results show that social network analysis tools and techniques have been widely employed to detect criminal networks and urban communities. In addition, correlation analysis has been used to investigate spatial–temporal patterns of crime, and ambient population measures have a significant impact on crime rates. © 2023 by the authors.","call detail records (CDRs); criminal networks; human communication behavior; mobile phone data; social networks; systematic literature review; urban crime prediction; urban dynamics; urban human mobility patterns; urban sensing","Cell Phone; Communication; Crime; Humans; Text Messaging; Transportation; Behavioral research; Cellular telephones; Crime; Digital devices; Information use; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Urban transportation; Call detail record; Call detail records; Communication behavior; Criminal networks; Human communication behavior; Human communications; Human mobility; Mobile phone datum; Mobility pattern; Social network; Systematic literature review; Urban crime prediction; Urban dynamics; Urban human mobility pattern; Urban sensing; crime; human; interpersonal communication; text messaging; traffic and transport; Forecasting","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159322095"

Understanding that only low-end mobile devices are normally present during real-life situations, the proposed solution is designed to be both lightweight and effective. Such a solution is achieved starting with the choice of backbone which is both highly efficient and provides optimal accuracy. To achieve this goal, the state-of-the-art image classification model MobileNet [1] was chosen due to its excellent generalization capability and high accuracy while remaining lightweight. The model was further optimized for tire pattern classification by applying the concept of Adaptation. This technique simplifies the model architecture while maintaining high accuracy, thus making it more suitable for deployment on mobile devices.After adaptation the complexity of the initial backbone was reduced >10x to only have about ~53K parameters while maintaining the accuracy to stand over 99% in classifying the test dataset containing tire patterns images.  © 2023 IEEE.","light weight DNN; MobileNet; NetAdapt; Network Adaptation","Classification (of information); Statistical tests; Tires; Crime investigation; High-accuracy; Light weight; Light weight DNN; Mobilenet; Netadapt; Network adaptation; Neural network model; Patterns classification; Tire patterns; Deep neural networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173622726"

Using the dynamic human activity variables sensed from mobile phone GPS big data sets, three types of ‘Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator’ (LASSO) regression models (i.e., static, dynamic, and static and dynamic) differentiated into explanatory variable groups were developed for seven types of property crime. Then, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to reveal the spatial associations between distinct explanatory variables and the specific type of crime. The findings demonstrated that human activity dynamics impose a substantially stronger influence on specific types of property crimes than other static variables. In terms of crime type, theft obtained particularly high relationships with dynamic human activity compared to other property crimes. Further analysis revealed important nuances in the spatial associations between property crimes and human activity across different contexts during the pandemic.

Warp-knitted non-crimp fabrics (NCF) are one possible way to produce such FRP composites. They are advantageous because of their low production costs and the ability to tailor the properties of the textile to the reinforcement and drape requirements of the application. Based on their specific production parameters, their draping properties can vary significantly. Draping simulations are used to predict the forming behaviour without relying on costly and time consuming trial and error experiments. However, these simulations require a broad material dataset to make accurate predictions. Previous studies have investigated the relationships between production parameters and drape behaviour only in isolation for a limited number of material parameters at a time. In this study, a comprehensive material characterisation is carried out. The influence of ply orientation, stitch pattern, stitch length and stitch tension on the tensile and bending properties and the friction, shear and drape behaviour of NCFs are investigated on a meso and macro scale. Furthermore, the inter-ply sliding phenomena in bias extension tests are analysed and the results of bias extension and picture frame tests are compared. © The Author(s) 2022.","bias extension test; draping, fibre reinforced plastics; NCF; Non-crimp fabrics, picture frame test; testing; warp knitting","Bias extension tests; Draping, fiber reinforced plastic; Materials characterization; Non-crimp fabric, picture frame test; Non-crimp fabrics; Picture frame test; Ply orientation; Stitch length; Warp knitting; Fiber reinforced plastics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138306357"

However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Crime location choice; People on the street; Physical environment; Street crime; Street view image","China; algorithm; crime; discrete choice analysis; machine learning; numerical model; segmentation; urban area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163536054"

This holds against malicious adversaries in the “standard” model for MPC, where a fixed set of n parties is involved in the full execution of the protocol. However, the picture is less clear in the mobile adversary setting of Ostrovsky and Yung (PODC 1991), where the adversary may periodically “move” by uncorrupting parties and corrupting a new set of t parties. In this setting, it is unclear if full security can be achieved against an adversary that is maximally mobile, i.e., moves after every round. The question is further motivated by the “You Only Speak Once” (YOSO) setting of Gentry et al. (Crypto 2021), where not only the adversary is mobile but also each round is executed by a disjoint set of parties. Previous positive results in this model do not achieve perfect security, and either assume probabilistic corruption and a nonstandard communication model, or only realize the weaker goal of security-with-abort. The question of matching the BGW result in these settings remained open. In this work, we tackle the above two challenges simultaneously. We consider a layered MPC model, a simplified variant of the fluid MPC model of Choudhuri et al. (Crypto 2021). Layered MPC is an instance of standard MPC where the interaction pattern is defined by a layered graph of width n, allowing each party to send secret messages and broadcast messages only to parties in the next layer. We require perfect security against a malicious adversary who may corrupt at most t parties in each layer. Our main result is a perfect, fully secure layered MPC protocol with an optimal corruption threshold of t&lt; n/ 3, thus extending the BGW feasibility result to the layered setting. This implies perfectly secure MPC protocols against a maximally mobile adversary. © 2023, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","","Computation theory; Cryptography; Graph theory; Computation model; Fixed sets; Layered graphs; Malicious adversaries; Mobile adversary; Multi-party computation protocols; Multiparty computation; Perfect securities; Secure multi-party computation; The standard model; Crime","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172330636"

These digital traces provide significant spatiotemporal (geospatial and time-related) data, revealing people’s mobility patterns as well as communication (incoming and outgoing calls) data, revealing people’s social networks and interactions. Thus, service providers collect smartphone data by recording the details of every user activity or interaction (e.g., making a phone call, sending a text message, or accessing the internet) done using a smartphone and storing these details on their databases. This paper surveys different methods and approaches for assessing and predicting human communication behaviors and mobility patterns from mobile phone data and differentiates them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses.

This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crime location choice; Crime pattern theory; Discrete spatial choice; Police data; Routine activity locations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135305103"

In recent years, theory-based and data-driven agent-based models have become useful tools in computational criminology with the abundance of public data, the rise of computing powers, and extensive explorations of related theories and modeling tools. In this paper, we present CARESim, an integrated simulation environment to predict the risks of high-risk individuals committing street violent crimes. The simulation environment combines agent-based modeling with a real geographical information system and incorporates public data (e.g., environmental data, crime data, census data, and transportation data) to reproduce authentic human mobility. This simulation environment is capable of replicating crime patterns and evaluating policies. We demonstrate the use of this environment and illustrate how key factors, such as social networks, the neighborhood, the weather, police patrol strategies, the population, and citizens’ behaviors, impact the risk of street-level violent offending. Furthermore, the environment can support the optimization of patrol strategies and offer evaluations of different social setups that could be unfeasible or expensive to test in real life. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling; Crime analysis; Data-driven models; Risk evaluation; Simulation environment","Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Computation theory; Computational methods; Population statistics; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Simulation platform; Agent based simulation; Agent-based model; Analysis evaluation; Complex nature; Crime analyse; Data-driven model; Human behaviors; Public data; Risk evaluation; Simulation environment; Crime","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141260186"

Here, the feasibility was to explore about relocating spectral data onto 3D-reconstructed dense point cloud through a new neural network HF-Net, one deep-learning-based AI technology and also a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that is able to simultaneously predict local features and global descriptors for spectral localization. Such an HF-Net was adopted to carry out the spectral relocation of heterogeneous localization. Specifically, the MobileNet and NetVLAD layers were taken to extract the global descriptors among the dataset of three-dimensional color point cloud from the spectral image so as to find the approximate position of spectral image in the three-dimensional point cloud. With the conjectural locations obtained through the prior global retrieval within those candidate places, the SuperPoint was utilized to get the local descriptors and key point scores of the spectral image so that the matching spectral points were found in the three-dimensional point cloud, therewith having mapped out the spectral information and three-dimensional reconstruction pattern. By leveraging the learned descriptors, this assay achieved remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance, demonstrating more robust and efficient than SSD algorithm. Due to limits with GPU (graphics processing unit) memory, the extracted spectral features were down-sampled from image to the largest resolution of 6016 × 4512 pixels. With HF-Net being trained through multi-task distillation in TensorFlow 1.12, a spectral image had been able to relocate into 3D reconstruction pattern in 12s under having run on the device of NVidia TESLA V100 with 32G memory and CPU of Intel (R) Xeon (R) Silver 4114 with 12G memory. The approach proposed here can realize the fine positioning of 3D spatial information and spectral features of 3D physical evidence. At present, there seems no such an exploration in forensic science home and abroad, revealing that the exploration tried here is a new application of artificial intelligence to the full-dimensional imaging data fusion technology of physical evidence. Such an HF-Net-based relocation is accurate, scalable, efficient, and a monolithic deep neural network choice for descriptor extraction, capable of achieving higher exactness on large-scale multi-spectral imaging fusion and 3D reconstruction. © 2022, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

Since loan applications, approvals and disbursements are operated online, deceptive borrowers are prone to conceal or falsify information to maliciously obtain loans, while lenders have difficulty in identifying fraud without direct contacts and lack binding force on customers' loan performance, which results in the frequent occurrence of fraud events. Therefore, it is significant for financial institutions to apply valuable data and competitive technologies for fraud detection to reduce financial losses from loan scams. This paper combines the advantages of statistical methods and ensemble learning algorithms to design the grouped trees and weighted ensemble algorithm (GTWE), and establishes fraud prediction models for online loans based on mobile application usage behaviors(App behaviors) by logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM) and the GTWE algorithm, respectively. The experimental results show that the fraud prediction model based on the GTWE algorithm achieves outstanding classification effect and stability with satisfactory interpretability. Meanwhile, the fraud probability of customers detected by the fraud prediction model is as high as 84.19%, which indicates that App behaviors have a considerable impact on predicting fraud in online loan application.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

Using criminal judgement, Points of Interest, Location-based Service data, road network, census data, housing data, and other data in the central urban area of Beijing and taking the 1 km×1 km square grid as our spatial analysis unit, this research demonstrates that thirty-seven types of urban facilities belong to the major crime generators, crime attractors or crime enablers at the global level, and the edge areas of roads, administrative districts and land uses are also proved to be evident theft locations. Among them, the more influential theft locations are more aligned with the crime generating conditions proposed by crime pattern theory, including accessible crime target and lower risk of arrest. Second, as stated by social disorganization theory, if the level of social disorganization composed by mobility factor and housing factor decreases, the number of theft location types as well as their impacts will gradually diminish. But except for the low social disorganization districts, the rankings of relative influence of various facilities and edge areas on theft crime remain relatively stable. Third, geographic detector has the advantages of no linear hypothesis, no collinearity problem, clear physical meaning and so on. But owing to the neglect of the potential interference by confounding factors, geographical detector would probably overestimate the impacts of independent variables. It can be testified by the moderate correlation between the rankings of the overall influence of theft locations obtained from the negative binomial regression and those calculated by the geographical detector. We suggest that combining elimination control method with geographical detector is a feasible path to achieve robust results, so classification discussion after grouping units with similar confounding factors is essential to overcome the potential endogeneity problem if we use geographical detector in crime geography as well as other sub-fields of human geography. © 2022, Science Press.

The purpose is to consider whether these historical factors are antecedent to current forms of deportation occurring in Australia, and to bring to the fore potential recurring patterns. Deportation is currently conceptualised by border criminologists as a punitive tool of discipline and control, within the realm of penal powers. Some of this work on the 'deportation regime' asserts that certain migrants, or groups of migrants, are undesirable: their identity, (not)belonging and punishment have become inherently intertwined, and their mobility has become politicised and criminalised. This article theorises that deportation has been used in Australia, now and in the past, to expel individuals who are viewed as detrimental to the 'health' of the host society. The 'deportation categories' demonstrate that migrants' desirability has historically been a temporary condition, shifting over time in line with the state's requirements. They also demonstrate the historical regime of criminalisation of undesirable others enacted through Australia's border control regime.  © The Author/s 2023.","border control; border historisation; crimmigration; Deportation; undesirable","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150873724"

Settlement communities have difficulty accessing facilities in the formal urban space. This study aims to formulate the elements that form the integration of slum areas. The method used is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The four stages in this SLR method are (1) identification; (2) screening; (3) eligibility; and (4) inclusion. A total of 62 articles were reviewed in this study. The results of this study are nineteen elements that form the integration of slum areas seen from physical and socio-economic aspects. If physical aspects include road network, accessibility, distance, public transportation, visual, public open space, periphery, settlement pattern, infrastructure, topography, and orientation, the socio-economic ones refer to local wisdom, background, social networks, types of activities, community empowerment, the sense of belonging, economic networks, and local economic empowerment.

In cases of robberies, it commonly happens that the banned entrance in locker room area which can be detected by our security system. If the robbery take place the banks are not capable to recognize the robber due to absence of the proof by using the current human security operated system. The system will be designed in effective way by recognizing and controlling the illegal person to access the locker for the safety of bank lockerroom. In this, we proposed a three-phase conformation of procedure for smart locker using some registered pattern knocks,camera and SMS which check out the user. As we compare to any other previous approaches our system uses the web App which send an OTP to user’s mobile which has to be opened using android app which highlights the smart security. The designed system is highly proficient and consistent because of three security stages and not capable to break the combination of this, three stages. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.","","Crime; Internet of things; Locks (fasteners); Security systems; 'current; Android apps; Controlling system; Human securities; Operated systems; Phase conformations; System use; Three phase; Three phasis; Web App; Face recognition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174390994"

The issue matters because it highlights the gendered nature of extractive violence and the urgent need to address the systemic patterns of violence that affect women defenders, who are often overlooked and underreported. Here we analyse violence against women defenders in environmental conflicts around the world. We use data from the Environmental Justice Atlas and employ log-linear and binomial regressions to find statistically significant patterns in displacement, repression, criminalization, violent targeting and assassinations committed against women defenders in extractive conflicts. Statistical results indicate that violence against women defenders is concentrated among mining, agribusiness and industrial conflicts in the geographical South. Repression, criminalization and violent targeting are closely linked, while displacement and assassination appear as extreme outcomes when conflict violence worsens. Women defenders experience high rates of violence regardless of countries’ governance accountability and gender equality. This work contributes to the broader sustainability agenda by highlighting the need to address the impacts of extractive activities on women. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Environmental conflict; Environmental justice; Gender equality; Global analysis; High rate; Indigenous community; Rural community; Significant patterns; Sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160822186"

In this article, Wangiri fraud in which users are deceived by being charged for services without their knowledge during a call is tackled. In fact, Wangiri fraud has significant negative financial and reputation consequences for the mobile service providers and also has a bad psychological impact on the victims. In order to identify this fraudulent behavior, three Wangiri fraud patterns are defined by analyzing call records of over a year. Then, the security and performance of unsupervised and supervised machine learning (ML) methods in detecting one Wangiri pattern are evaluated using a large real-world Call Detail Records (CDRs) data set. In the context of Wangiri fraud detection, classification algorithms outperformed the others based on the chosen security and performance metrics. Finally, the performance evaluation of these algorithms is extended in detecting the other two real-world Wangiri fraud patterns. This article provides a detailed definition of the Wangiri fraud patterns and outlines the implementation and evaluation of ML algorithms in the context of detecting Wangiri fraud. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that depending on fraud patterns the best ML algorithm to detect Wangiri fraud may also vary.  © 2014 IEEE.","Machine learning (ML); pattern analysis; telecommunication fraud; Wangiri fraud","Crime; Internet of things; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Classification algorithm; Communicationtechnology; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Oral communication; Pattern analysis; Security; Security and performance; Telecommunication fraud; Wangiri fraud.; Costs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132524995"

The invention and application of mobile internet technology have broadened the communication channels of virtual society, and more and more netizens are expressing their views on social issues through the internet. There is an urgent need to analyze the mechanism of online language violence, explore governance strategies for online language violence, strengthen ideological and political education in universities, and adapt to the romantic situation of college students in the era of the internet. This study starts with the characteristics of online bullying in universities. It analyzes the derivation and dissemination mechanisms of campus online bullying through statistical analysis of the development patterns of campus online violence in typical network events. Research has found that online violence is mainly spread through platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, mainly through group or private chat attacks. At the same time, online violence can increase the crime rate among teenagers through theft and robbery. Campus online violence will have a profound impact on the growth of teenagers from both practical and psychological perspectives. Intervention in ideological and political education on campus and blocking online platforms within a week of online violence are essential means of organizing campus online violence. Meanwhile, continuous ideological and political education can significantly reduce the crime rate among minors caused by online violence. © (2023), (Elite Scientific Publications).

The detection based on malware categories will provide more insights about the malicious patterns of the malware. Therefore, this paper presents a detection solution for different Android malware categories, including adware, banking, SMS malware, and riskware. In this paper, a novel Huffman encoding-based feature vector generation technique is proposed. The experiments have proved that this novel approach significantly improves the efficiency of the detection model. This method makes use of system call frequencies as features to extract malware’s dynamic behavior patterns. The proposed model was evaluated using machine learning and deep learning methods.

This is the case for the Northern Territory in Australia, a vast and sparsely populated jurisdiction. Its government has long sought to encourage stronger population growth but its population is young and highly transient, leading to high staff turn-overs and challenges for industries and government to attract families and skilled workers. Place-based factors such as job opportunities, access to essential services or environmental amenities influence satisfaction and migration decisions. The aim of this study was to understand why people might stay or move away through analysing responses to two open-text questions on the best and worst aspect of living in the Northern Territory. Over 3500 valid responses were analysed using machine learning-based unsupervised topic modelling which uncovered latent clusters. Forty-four percent of positive aspects were clustered into lifestyle factors, while negative aspects clustered around high living costs and crime. Some aspects, such as the weather and distance to other places were discussed as both positive and negative aspects. Topics discussed by respondents could be directly related to their intention to leave the Northern Territory, and also to specific individual's demographic characteristics providing insights for policies focused on attracting and retaining population. The use of unsupervised text mining in population research is rare and this study verifies its use to deliver objective and nuanced results generated from a large qualitative data set. © 2023 The Authors.

Understanding street activities and how these activities vary across different streets is critical for designing both efficient and livable streets. However, current street classification frameworks primarily focus on either streets’ functions in transportation networks or their adjacent land uses rather than actual activity patterns, resulting in coarse classifications. This research proposes an activity-based street classification framework to categorize street segments based on their temporal street activity patterns, which is derived from high-resolution de-identified and privacy-enhanced mobility data. We then apply the proposed framework to 18,023 street segments in the City of Boston and reveal 10 distinct activity-based street types (ASTs). These ASTs highlight dynamic street activities on streets, which complements existing street classification frameworks, which focus on the static or transportation characteristics of the street segments. Our results show that a street classification framework based on temporal street activity patterns can identify street categories at a finer granularity than current methods, which can offer useful implications for state-of-the-art urban management and planning. In particular, we find that our classification distinguishes better those streets where crime is more prevalent than current functional or contextual classifications of streets. © 2022, The Author(s).","Clustering; FCM; Mobile phone GPS data; Street activity; Street classification; Temporal patterns; Urban management","Urban growth; Classification framework; Clusterings; FCM; GPS data; Mobile phone GPS; Mobile phone GPS data; Street activity; Street classification; Temporal pattern; Urban management; Land use","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135142327"

This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods: Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results: Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions: Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crime location choice; Discrete choice modelling; Police data; Routine activity nodes; Sampling from alternatives","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111506409"

Nevertheless, related work has shown that crime incident data can suffer from under-reporting bias whereby certain social groups report more crimes than others and whereby certain crimes are recorded more often by the police. In addition, under the umbrella of crime opportunity theories that suggest that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based crime models implemented with deep learning. However, prior work has shown that human mobility data collected from cell phones can suffer from sampling bias because certain population groups are not equally represented due to lack of cell phone ownership. Despite these well reported data bias concerns, no related work has yet looked into the fairness of place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep learning; nor into the effect that adding human mobility data from cell phones as a predictor might have on their fairness. In this paper, we use publicly available fine-grained crime incident and human mobility data from the US to conduct a comprehensive fairness audit across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, different types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we explore potential root causes of the models' fairness metrics by looking into crime data bias, mobility data bias and algorithmic bias. Our results show that unfair predictions are pervasive across place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep-learning due to the inherent data bias in the crime incident data; that adding mobility features extracted from cell phone data decreases fairness under certain circumstances; and that part of the fairness loss can be explained by bias in the crime data, and in the predictive algorithms that might be exacerbating the data bias, with the mobility data bias having an insignificant effect on fairness loss. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic fairness; Crime prediction; Data bias; Human mobility","United States; Cellular telephones; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Population statistics; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Cell phone; Crime prediction; Data bias; Human mobility; Mobility datum; Place-based; Prediction modelling; Related works; algorithm; crime; machine learning; modeling; prediction; Crime","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151716359"

As emerging mobility options, the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services has rarely been simultaneously examined. This study contributes to filling this gap by jointly analyzing the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services and examining how it varies across neighborhood-level built environment, transit accessibility and crime, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors. To achieve these objectives, unique geo-coded data containing millions of ride-sourcing and DRS trips in Chicago are spatially joined with up-to-date data on the built environment, transit accessibility, crime, active travel, and demographic factors. A novel Markov Random Field-based joint heterogeneous geo-additive copula framework is presented to simultaneously capture random, systematic, and spatial heterogeneity. Characterized by a Frank copula structure, the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services exhibited a non-linear stochastic dependence pattern. With spatial heterogeneity and spillover effects, the stochastic dependence of ride-sourcing and DRS demand varied across time of day and was the strongest in compact and dense neighborhoods. Key aspects of the built environment related to urban design (pedestrian-oriented infrastructure), density, and land-use diversity were positively associated with ride-sourcing and DRS demand—suggesting that sustainable mobility goals can be achieved by continuing to invest in more walkable neighborhoods. Active travel and telecommuting were positively linked with ride-sourcing and DRS demand. Complementary and substitutive effects for transit accessibility were found. Results show that increasing transit accessibility in areas with low levels of accessibility (compared to those with high transit levels) could be more helpful in increasing the adoption of ride-sourcing and DRS services. Relative to ride-sourcing, the demand for DRS services appeared more responsive to improvements in pedestrian-infrastructure and transit accessibility. Quantification of non-linear associations with ceiling and overdose effects for the built environment, vehicle ownership, and transit accessibility provided deeper insights. The findings can help guide the development of policy interventions and investment decisions to further accelerate the adoption of mobility-on-demand systems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Built environment; Ceiling and overdose effects; Copula; Dynamic ridesharing; Markov random fields; Nonlinearity; Ride-sourcing; Spatial heterogeneity; Transit accessibility and active travel","Chicago; Illinois; United States; Crime; Investments; Land use; Markov processes; Risk assessment; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Built environment; Ceiling and overdose effect; Copula; Dynamic ridesharing; Markov Random Fields; Nonlinearity; Ride-sharing; Ride-sourcing; Spatial heterogeneity; Transit accessibility and active travel; accessibility; nonlinearity; public transport; telecommuting; urban design; urban transport; Additives","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130455611"

Methods: The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results: The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closerto their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offendinglocations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors andgenerators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions: By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime locationchoice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory.

Big data from multiple sources during 2016 to 2020, including court records, location-based service data, street view images, points of interest, and road networks were used together. The results indicate that characteristics of permeable built environment such as land use density, mixing degree of urban functions, road network density, and transparency of street buildings all have positive and significant associations with the density of theft crimes in general. Furthermore, the direction and intensity of incluence of built environment features on criminal activities vary depending on the social ecological factors of communities. In other words, the degrees of social disorganization moderate the links between permeable environment and theft distribution. With social disorganization exacerbating, including the increase in residential instability, visitor mobility, employee mobility, population heterogeneity, and socioeconomic disadvantages, the positive effects of permeable built environment on crime will be steadily magnified, which more conforms to the defensible space theory. On the contrary, street eyes theory has better explanatory power in communities with stable social structure and abundant social capital where street eyes can be activated so as to provide effective informal surveillance to ensure safety. Unfortunately, according to the critical value of moderators estimated by the regression models, the later situation is less common in Beijing, suggesting that defensible space theory is more applicable in the majority of communities and the safety risks would increase when applying the approach of New Urbanism. © 2022, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Recently, there is an increasing interest in using the received signal strength (RSS) to detect IBAs in wireless networks. However, current schemes tend to generate excessive false alarms in the mobile scenario. In this paper, we propose a stronger Reciprocal Channel Variation-based Identification and classification (RCVIC) scheme for the mobile wireless networks, which exploits the reciprocity of the wireless fading channel and RSS variations naturally incurred by mobility to improve the detection performance. Different from current schemes only detect IBAs, RCVIC scheme conducts a multi-stage detection processes. If the IBAs are detected, RCVIC scheme partitions the received frames into two classes. The frames in the same class should be sent from the same senders, which could benefit the further analysis, such as network forensics, attacker localizing and trajectory analysis, etc. The feasibility of RCVIC are numerically evaluated through theoretical analysis and simulations. It is further validated through experiments using off-the-shelf 802.11 devices under different attacking patterns in real indoor and outdoor mobile scenarios. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","channel reciprocity; Identity-based attacks detection; IEEE 802.11; mobile network; partition; RSS","Computer crime; Digital forensics; Fading channels; IEEE Standards; Attack detection; Channel reciprocity; Channel variations; Identity-based; Identity-based attack detection; IEEE 802.11; Mobile network; Partition; Received signal strength; Reciprocal channels; Wireless networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128521054"

Motiveless does not mean that the police do not know the motive for the homicide, but rather that no other motive could accurately and objectively explain the reason for why the homicide occurred. However, this is especially problematic for the police because failing to establish a homicide motive is considered an investigative shortcoming. Due to the limited research conducted to date on motiveless homicides and the significant challenges they pose to investigators, the current study examines the geographic mobility patterns involved in these homicides. Using a sample of 194 solved cases of motiveless homicide from France, the criminal mobility triangle approach was used to explore their geographic patterns. Moreover, correlates of the entire criminal event were included for an in-depth understanding of these cases. The findings revealed various mobility patterns involved in motiveless homicides, combined with some specific correlates of the criminal event.

Increasing social networks and facilitating teenager access to the Internet have increased the probability of cybercrimes. On the other hand, entertainment such as mobile and computer games is top-rated among teenagers. Teenagers' tendency to cybercrime may be influenced by individual, parent, social, economic and political factors. Studying the impact of social networks, mobile games and parents' religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is the primary goal of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a considerable change in the world and the lifestyle of all people. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was also affected by the special conditions of this virus. Changes in ICT and rapid access to it have empowered individuals and organizations, and people have increased civic participation and interaction through ICT. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created new challenges for the government and citizens and may cause new crimes. Cybercrime is a type of crime that occurs in a cyber environment. These crimes range from invasions of privacy to crimes in which the offender vaguely paralyzes the macroeconomic. In this research, 265 students of high schools and universities are used for collecting data by utilizing a survey. Measuring actions have been done in all surveys employing a Likert scale. The causal pattern is assessed through a constructional equation modeling procedure to study the scheme's validity and reliability. Findings: The outcomes have indicated that social networks have no significant relationship with teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Mobile games have a mild effect on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era, and parents' religious attitudes significantly impact teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications: Current research also has some restrictions that must be noticed in assessing the outcomes. First, sample research was selected from high schools and universities in one city. So, the size of the model is small, and the generalization of results is limited. Second, this research may have ignored other variables that affect the tendency of teenagers' to cybercrime. Future researchers intend to investigate the parents' upbringing system's impact on teenager's trend to cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Future research can also examine practical factors such as parental upbringing, attitudes toward technology development and virtual addiction in the COVID-19 era. Originality/value: In this study, teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is investigated, and a procedure is applied depending on a practical occasion. This article's offered sample provides a perfect framework for influencing parents' social networks, mobile games and religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID 19; Cybercrimes; Mobile game; Psychology; Religious attitudes; Social network; Sociocybernetics","Computer crime; Crime; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Surveys; Community IS; COVID 19; Cyber-crimes; Higher School; Information and Communication Technologies; Mobile games; Psychology; Religious attitude; Social network; Sociocybernetic; Computer games","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122817959"

The article reveals the features of the criminal prosecution of riots using information technology. The main areas of using automated data banks and information retrieval systems in the investigation of mass riots are determined. Domestic and foreign possibilities of using information technologies in the organization of investigative work, in accounting and control over the materials of criminal cases on mass riots, in fixing the circumstances of crimes and in proving them are shown. The structure of the program for making and supporting the decision to create a specialized investigative group designed to work in emergency conditions is determined. As part of such a group, it is proposed to immediately organize its own information center with its own databank of episodes and persons, taking into account the primary materials on the facts of riots using the programs intended for this. For the formation of information about the general situation of mass riots, special mathematical models for the study of space-time patterns are intended. Recommendations are formulated to survey a large area and recreate a unified picture of disturbances using quadcopters. To determine the involvement of a person in riots, it is recommended to compare data from various electronic sources, such as email correspondence, electronic documents and mobile communication log files, the history of search queries in web browsers, cards and payment systems, etc. The modern judicial practice of proving participation in mass riots using, along with photo and video materials, the corresponding fragments of records also placed in electronic means is assessed. © 2021 Saint Petersburg State University.

Method: The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors. Results: Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that some of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the findings suggested that the changes in mobility explain part of the declines observed, with important variations per crime type. Conclusion: The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explicitly test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities. © 2021, The Author(s).","ARIMA; COVID-19; Crime incidence; Mexico City","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109048969"

It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both ‘crime type’ appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the ‘dynamic denominator’ challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation. This special issue explores a range of potential solutions to this including mobile/cell phone data, transportation data, land use data, and other possible measures to address this. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Ambient population; Crime; Crime denominators; Exposed population; Hot spots; Spatio-temporal crime hot spots; Urban mobility","","Editorial","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119159606"

Blockchain technology integrates different recognition techniques of distributed pattern for monitoring database of a dedicated network and has proven a very promising technology. An automated pattern recognition decentralizes and distributes customized specific data. Machine learning, originated from artificial intelligence is primarily related to recognition of behavior patterns. Methods like knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining focus on unsupervised approaches and are widely used in business and climatic weather applications. Blockchain addresses data-security concerns and builds trust by creating distributed ledger. Theft, willful fraud, software and hardware are considered by blockchain in data protection. Blockchain has greater significant feature as it makes the secure data access without enabling the central management entity. Two design features of blockchain technology help in this task. Recommended customer data pattern recognition technique using blockchain may eliminate all these problems. Two kinds of cryptographic algorithms employed in blockchain are asymmetric-key algorithms and hash functions. The current study analyzes the asymmetric cryptography approach along with key pair which supports in system security. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier techniques consider both old customers and new customers as stable. The predictive model aids in identifying customers at churn risk in the telecommunication system. Existing proactive methods are unable to explain difficulties in customer interaction understanding and meeting their genuine needs. The proposed model organizes the customer situation and designs a customer proactive re-engagement over mobile-based telecommunication systems. Performance measures like churn prediction, classifier, confusion matrix, machine learning in the telecommunication system are used to evaluate and validate the results. © 2022","Blockchain technology; Churn prediction; Classifier; Climatic Weather; Support vector machine; Telecommunication system","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Crime; Data mining; Distributed ledger; Forecasting; Hash functions; Hidden Markov models; Recurrent neural networks; Sales; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Churn predictions; Climatic weather; Customer retention; Customer-service; Distributed patterns; Prediction-based; Proactive measures; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125816960"

In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of Fintech, base of the pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the SSA context. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources. The authors interviewed respondents from the Sierra Leone Fintech Association and four BOP entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. Findings: The authors find that Fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. FinTech also offers growth possibilities for BOP entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. At the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing BOP entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development. Research limitations/implications: This study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between BOP entrepreneurship, social value creation and Fintech. For example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like Fintech. However, in a country like Sierra Leone, which has experienced both a civil war and Ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by BOP inhabitants. Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on Fintech's application in BOP contexts. Practical implications: A key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits. Fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. Fintech offers BOP entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating Fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more BOP entrepreneurs using these services. Social implications: The authors find that at the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of BOP consumers who interact with case firms. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on BOP entrepreneurship and social value creation by Fintech services in an SSA context. It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's Fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or Fintech firms. Finally, there is a specific focus on BOP entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Base of pyramid (BOP); Entrepreneurship; Fintech; Sierra Leone; Social value","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116860527"

However, political science analyses of violence against public-facing women have so far largely overlooked the peculiarities of technology-facilitated attacks. On the other hand, studies of digital gender-based abuse from the fields of psychology, criminology, gender and media studies mostly adopt an individual-level focus on either perpetrators or survivors. In the present chapter, I propose to connect these different streams of literature to provide a multi-level conceptualisation of digital violence against politically active women. Furthermore, I integrate a set of concepts and propositions from feminist and institutional theories, which I use to link micro-aspects of violent digital interactions to global patterns of white male radicalisation, as well as to the mobilisation strategies of political operators seeking to capitalise on the support of anti-feminist groups. In so doing, I shed light on emerging empirical trends, systematise existing knowledge, and advance theory-building efforts on the micro-foundations of patriarchal power and their ties to contemporary socio-political developments. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

In general, cameras are used for gait recognition, and several methods in previous studies have used depth information captured by RGB-D cameras. However, RGB-D cameras are limited in terms of their measurement distance and are difficult to access outdoors. In recent years, real-time multi-layer 3D LiDAR, which can obtain 3D range images of a target at ranges of over 100 m, has attracted significant attention for use in autonomous mobile robots, serving as eyes for obstacles detection and navigation. Compared with cameras, such 3D LiDAR has rarely been used for biometrics owing to its low spatial resolution. However, considering the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, such as the robustness of the illumination conditions, long measurement distances, and wide-angle scanning, the approach has the potential to be applied outdoors as a biometric identifier. The present paper describes a gait recognition system, called 2V-Gait, which is robust to variations in the walking direction of a subject and the distance measured from the 3D LiDAR. To improve the performance of gait recognition, we leverage the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, which are not included in regular cameras. Extensive experiments on our dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2022 IEEE.","","Biometrics; Cameras; Mobile robots; Optical radar; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Biometric identifiers; Criminal investigation; Depth information; Gait recognition; Multi-layers; Range images; Real- time; Walking direction; Walking pattern; Gait analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126195286"

Using a sociological framework and building on empirical data on 996 professional agents, the analysis outlines how the market in and around the international criminal courts is structured by three different social groups that dominate the formal roles of judges, prosecutors and defence counsel. The article investigates the relative positionality of these groups highlighting the low degree of mobility between them. It also demonstrates the reproduction of male, global north professionals at the top of these groups, pointing towards intersectional dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in this market. To deepen the analysis of divisions of labour and reproduction of status, the article turns to a closer analysis of the patterns of expertise upon which elite status is built and how it links the three groups to the wider market of international criminal justice. The relations between the identified social groups, the elite of which have very particular characteristics dominated by global north professionals, educations and networks, structure a core part of the market of international criminal justice and formats the social fault lines behind its normative debates.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Owing to the limited data protection of various popular online services in some countries, such as taxi hailing and ordering takeouts, many users presently encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. The situation may be aggravated when criminals pretend to be such service delivery staff, threatening the user individuals as well as the society. In addition, numerous people experience excessive digital marketing and fraudulent phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, which does not work for the identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones might exhibit their application preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession-related information. This offers researchers and engineers a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies and regulations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation). We observe that appropriate statistical methods can offer an effective means to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, thus enabling the identification of the types of mobile phone callers without privacy concerns. In this paper, we develop CPFinder —- a system that exploits privacy-preserving mobile data to automatically identify callers who are divided into four categories of users: taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters, and normal users (other professions). Our evaluation of an anonymized dataset of 1,282 users over a period of 3 months in Shanghai City shows that the CPFinder can achieve accuracies of more than 75.0% and 92.4% for multiclass and binary classifications, respectively. © 2021 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Classification; Machine learning; Mobile big data; Privacy protection; Profession prediction","Cellular telephones; Classification (of information); Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Taxicabs; Web services; Binary classification; Limited data; Machine-learning; Mobile big data; Mobile phone datum; Personal property; Personal safety; Phone calls; Privacy protection; Profession prediction; Machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122689888"

However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery.

As technology advances, so does the number of users, which leads to an increase in criminal activity and demand for a cyber-crime investigation. Mobile phones have been the epicenter of illegal activity in recent years. Sensitive information is transferred due to numerous technical applications available at one’s fingertips, which play an essential part in cyber-crime attacks in the mobile environment. Mobile forensic is a technique of recovering or retrieving digital evidence from mobile devices so that it may be submitted in court for legal procedures. As a result, mobile phone data is essential for obtaining evidence in elements of mobile forensic data ana-lysis. So, in this paper, we offer a method for detecting suspect drug-dealing patterns in mobile devices utilizing forensic and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Machine Learning algorithms are used to uncover the pattern in an original dataset, and performance measurements are used to assess the suggested system. In our approach, Logistic Regression (LR) manifests 95% of the highest accuracy in terms of count vector whereas, the BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) also achieved 95% of accuracy in terms of TFIDF. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

In this sense, the feeling of being “safe” or “at-risk” in public transportation not only depends on observable factors like illumination, travel companionship or transport crowding, but also on unobservable individual-specific latent attributes, among which fear of crime constitutes a major issue to consider in transport security policy-making. This study aimed to describe the relationships among sociodemographic features, travel situations, system-design features, and the Fear of Crime at three different locations (buses, bus stops, and stations) of the BRT system of Barranquilla (Colombia). Using an image-based survey applied in Barranquilla, data was collected from a full-sample of 500 adult users (64% females and 36% males) of the system. It was estimated a hybrid choice model to include location-based fear of crime in public transportation perception of risk, along with attributes related to (e.g.) surveillance, crowding, time of the day, and companionship. The relation between fear of crime and perception of security in public transportation is negative and highly significant. FoC inside the bus has the highest negative effect on the utility, followed by bus stops and BRT Stations, for which it remains non-significant. Gender (being a female user) was the strongest FoC predictor. Moreover, it was found that the higher is the user's income, the lower is the fear of crime reported for each one of these three types of location. Overall, the inclusion of the fear of crime perception in the estimation of the hybrid choice model enhances the model fit. Also, the user-related findings of this study at different locations provide a better understanding of the decision-making process and the predictors of fear of crime in BRT systems. © 2021 The Authors","Fear of Crime; Hybrid Choice Models; Latent variables; Public Transportation; Risk perception","Atlantico; Barranquilla; Colombia; Behavioral research; Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Buses; Crime; Location; Bus stop; Choice model; Colombia; Fear of crime; Hybrid choice model; Latent variable; Latent variable modeling; Public fears; Public transportation; Urban scenarios; bus transport; crime; decision making; public transport; risk perception; travel behavior; Risk perception","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119402802"

This paper focuses on cyberbullying detection in mobile phone text by retrieving with the help of an oxygen forensics toolkit. We describe the data collection using forensics technique and a corpus of suspicious activities like cyberbullying annotation from mobile phones and carry out a sequence of binary classification experiments to determine cyberbullying detection. We use forensics techniques, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to exploit suspicious patterns to help the forensics investigation where every evidence contributes to the case. Experiments on a real-time dataset reveal better results for the detection of cyberbullying content. The Random Forest in ML approach produces 87% of accuracy without SMOTE technique, whereas the value of F1Score produces a good result with SMOTE technique.

These devices provide users with a comprehensive platform to undertake activities such as socializing, communicating, sending and receiving e-mails, and storing and accessing personal data at any time and from any location. Nowadays, smartphones are used to store a multitude of private and sensitive data including bank account information, personal identifiers, account passwords and credit card information. Many users remain permanently signed in and, as a result, their mobile devices are vulnerable to security and privacy risks through assaults by criminals. Passcodes, PINs, pattern locks, facial verification, and fingerprint scans are all susceptible to various assaults including smudge attacks, side-channel attacks, and shoulder-surfing attacks. To solve these issues, this research introduces a new continuous authentication framework called DeepAuthen, which identifies smartphone users based on their physical activity patterns as measured by the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors on their smartphone. We conducted a series of tests on user authentication using several deep learning classifiers, including our proposed deep learning network termed DeepConvLSTM on the three benchmark datasets UCI-HAR, WISDM-HARB and HMOG. Results demonstrated that combining various motion sensor data obtained the highest accuracy and energy efficiency ratio (EER) values for binary classification. We also conducted a thorough examination of the continuous authentication outcomes, and the results supported the efficacy of our framework. © 2021 by the authors.

Online transactions, purchases, and transactions are growing exponentially on e-commerce sites. Similarly, the number of online scammers increased, and the recent increase in credit card payments makes credit card fraud a very serious threat. Institutions lose huge sums of money every year due to fraud. As these agencies tighten their security measures, scammers are constantly looking for new ways to use their nefarious methods. Well-known online payment methods include credit and debit cards, internet banking, and mobile banking. Because of its easy usage, people tend to prefer credit card payments, and as a result, fraudulent transactions related to these types of transactions are increasing. In this article, we propose a method to detect credit card fraud transactions using a neural network autoencoder. The credit card fraud detection problem is generally considered a classification problem. This requires rebalancing any data imbalances present in the dataset. In this article, we propose to treat this problem as an outlier detection problem that does not require a solution. This article also describes various parameters to consider when training a model. We also published the experimental results and conclusions. The goal of our project is to develop a robust fraud detection system that is inherently dynamic and rapidly adapts to changing fraud patterns and requires little or no manual processing during model inference and training. The proposed system architecture provides estimates of the ROC AUC(area under the receiver operating curve) at 0.9212, 0.8976, 0.9378, 0.9489, and 0.9512 at all multiples, with a cumulative ROC AUC of 0.9314 without manual coding.  © 2022 IEEE.","Auto Encoder; Credit card frauds; E-Commerce; Imbalanced data; Neural Network; ROC AUC","Crime; Learning systems; Network coding; Auto encoders; Credit card fraud detections; Credit card frauds; Credit card payment; Detection problems; E-commerce sites; Imbalanced data; Neural-networks; Online transaction; ROC AUC; Electronic commerce","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128870782"

According to (Liu in Oxford Bibliographies in Geogr 2021), crime geography and crime analysis normally cover spatio-temporal crime pattern detection, crime explanation, crime prediction, crime prevention and crime intervention assessment. The acronym of DEPPA captures these five elements. Pattern detection uncovers spatio-temporal patterns of crime distribution, such as crime hotspots. Crime explanation aims to discern major contributing factors based on multivariate regression modeling and machine learning. Crime prediction forecasts future crime patterns using machine learning and other predictivemethods. Crime prevention devises targeted intervention strategies such as hot spot policing, based on historical and future crime patterns. Assessment examines the effectiveness of crime prevention, to find out if crime is reduced in the targeted area and whether the nearby areas are affected by the intervention.

Due to combining the potential capability of individual models into one hybrid framework, it has outperformed various other individual machine learning and deep learning models.

In total, 4041 criminal trips committed by 892 individual offenders who lived and committed residential burglary in Tokyo were analyzed. Each criminal trip was allocated to an origin–destination pair created from the combination of potential departure and arrival zones. The following explanatory variables were created from an external dataset and used: residential population, density of residential burglaries, and mobility patterns of the general population. The origin-specific factors served as indices of not only the production of criminal trips, but also the opportunity to commit crimes in the origin zones. Moreover, the criminal trips were related to the mobility patterns of the general population representing daily leisure (noncriminal) trips, and relatively large origin-and destination-based spatial spillover effects were estimated. It was shown that considering not only destination-specific but also origin-specific factors, spatial structures are important for investigating the criminal trips of residential burglars.

Large-scale shifts in human activities bestowed both positive and negative impacts on wildlife. Unforeseen reduction in the activities of people allowed wildlife to venture outside of forested areas to exploit newfound habitats and increase their diurnal activities. While on a negative note, a reduction in forest-related law enforcement led to substantial increase in illegal activities such as poaching. We conducted mammal surveys in forested and nearby farmland of a fragmented landscape under two distinct scenarios: pre-lockdown and lockdown. An increase in poaching activities observed during the lockdown period in our study area provided us an opportunity to investigate the impact of the lockdown on wildlife. Camera trapping data of four highly poached mammalian species, namely black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis, wild pig Sus scrofa, four-horned antelope Tetracerus quadricornis and leopard Panthera pardus were considered to investigate activity patterns and habitat use, to understand the effect of lockdown. The pre-lockdown period was used as a baseline to compare any changes in trends of activity patterns, habitat use and detection probabilities of targeted species. Species-specific changes in activity patterns of study species were observed, with an increment in daytime activity during lockdown. The results showed species-specific increase in the habitat use of study species during lockdown. Reduction in the detection probability of all study species was witnessed. This is the first study to highlight the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the responses of wildlife by considering the changes in their temporal and spatial use before and during lockdown.

This threatens visa-free travel, freedom of settlement and borderland economies in parts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It has interrupted historical mobility patterns, depleted the diversity of mobility practices and criminalized regional economies. At the same time, one can observe intensified and asymmetrical violent conflict in some of these borderlands. By taking the Kantchari-Makalondi borderland as a case study we analysed the relations between migration policies, insecurity, forced immobility and economic decline. Our observations and interviews with migrants, traders, security forces and borderlanders lead us to question conventional narratives on border control and African mobilities as a binary relation between Africa and Europe. Instead, they foreground the multiple practices of (im)mobility in these spaces: the circulation and blockage of travelers, merchandise, surveillance technologies, and military interventions and their impact on security and livelihoods. © 2021 The Author(s).

Prominent attention has been given to agglomeration advantages, mobility patterns, urban decay, inequity problems, residents’ quality of life, safety and crime, labour and housing markets, public amenities, and urban planning issues. Less attention however, has been paid to the basic question: what makes the city a ‘real’ and attractive city? This question prompts essentially a research challenge on the ‘raison d'etre’ of cities, in particular on the residential satisfaction and quality-of-life motives of urban inhabitants. The present paper aims to pinpoint attractiveness characteristics of cities based on perceptions of urban quality by residents and their affinity with city life. This paper offers a micro-based (individual) assessment of motives and appreciations of citizens, in terms of their love for the city. A typological distinction will be made between the ‘soul’ of the city (its spirit, history, cultural identity, ambiance, social capital, etc.) and the ‘body’ of the city (its built environment, infrastructure, public amenities, supply of housing, green areas, etc.). The empirical analysis – applied to the four largest cities in Sweden (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmoe and Umea) – will be undertaken in two steps: (i) an exploratory statistical analysis of the findings from an extensive micro-based survey questionnaire among inhabitants in these four urban agglomerations; (ii) an explanatory evaluation of the individual appreciation scores using a regression approach. Our results show that the ‘City Love Index’ is a useful construct that can be decomposed into ‘soul’ and ‘body’ aspects of the city. Our multivariate regression analysis demonstrates clearly that both factors matter. More detailed results suggest that it is the perceptions regarding the city's ‘walkability’ and ‘vibrancy’, both part of the ‘soul’ of the city, that have a significant influence on the City Love Index - for all cities studied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Appreciation; Attractiveness; City love; Quality of life; ‘body’ and ‘soul’; ‘New Urban World’","Goteborg; Stockholm [Stockholm (CNT)]; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; Umea; Vasterbotten; Vastra Gotaland; quality of life; residential satisfaction; urban housing; urban region","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085650922"

Based on our research, it can be concluded that 5G still faces security challenges. In the frame of our analysis, we have determined several security concerns. It must also be mentioned that lately, the scientists have found different security problems in the existing 5G networks that give hacker the opportunity to install the undesirable code into the 5G system and perform undesirable actions. The corresponding attacks are MNmap, MiTM and the Battery drain attack. Therefore, it is mandatory to design new architectures for 5G and the future networks, which can be defined as 6G ones, for this, it is obligatory to provide the new machine learning algorithms, which will give the scientists the opportunity to provide high-level security. The article analyzes the existing security problems of 5G architecture. Based on the research, a new cyber security model is offered, which is based AI/ML algorithms. It envisions the fundamental components, the firewall, intrusion detection and intrusion protection systems. We apply the offered security model into already existing architecture of 5G. The paper essentially describes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is a part of proposed model. The IDS implements a comprehensive methodology for the identification of the attacks to which the 5G systems can be vulnerable. These attack patterns include MNmap, MiTM and the Battery drain attacks. The methodology is described in the paper. The article analyzes the efficiency of the described model, through the design and implementation of a comprehensive testing laboratory. In the laboratory there are a server and 50 raspberry pi, with fifty 4G modems, which are needed in order to make the simulation of the attacks on the corresponding server. The paper also suggests the improvement approach, which could be integrated into the system in future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","5G security; Attacks; Attacks on 5G; Detection methods","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Electric batteries; Intrusion detection; Laboratories; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mobile security; Network architecture; Network security; Personal computing; Queueing networks; 5g security; Attack; Attack on 5g; Detection methods; Hybrid detection; Industry experience; Intrusion Detection Systems; Security modeling; Security problems; Telecommunications industry; 5G mobile communication systems","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126675492"

In every region, the volume of vehicles traveling through border crossings has increased significantly. Smartcards and radio frequency identification (RFID) have been proposed as a new method of identifying and authenticating passengers, products, and vehicles. However, the usage of smartcards and RFID tag cards for vehicular border crossings continues to suffer security and flexibility challenges. Providing a vehicle’s driver a smartcard or RFID tag card may result in theft, loss, counterfeit, imitation, or vehicle transmutation. RFID sticker tags would replace RFID tags as vehicle border passes to solve the mentioned problem. The RFID sticker tag adheres to the windscreen, side screen, dash, hood, or door of the vehicle, or any other acceptable location. Any damage or stripping from the installed location may cause data corruption and cannot be reused. Overall, these sticker tags will make the border crossings more secure and efficient. This article focuses on designing a rectangular-shaped RFID sticker tag antenna made of graphene sheets as a possible solution for smart border crossings. The proposed antenna is mathematically designed and analyzed with CST software to determine the optimum parameters. The design parameters are then used to create an antenna on a prepared graphene sheet. The performance results are carried out with CST software and a network analyzer. The designed RFID antenna stick on a car windscreen offers approximately 900 MHz bandwidth over the frequency range from 1.8 GHz to 2.7 GHz with an average gain of 1.23 dBi at the frequency to be used of 2.4 GHz microwave RFID band. The radiation is an omnidirectional pattern. The proposed graphene-sheet rectangular-shape monopole antenna is compact, low-cost, and bendable to fit into the windscreen of a car while retaining excellent wave propagation capabilities. These findings illustrate the suggested antenna’s potential as an RFID tag antenna in a vehicular smart border pass system. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

It is widely used in military, medical, transportation, and agriculture. With the rapid development of UAV technology, as well as the high mobility of UAVs and the wide range of high-altitude vision, the target detection technology based on UAV vision is applied to traffic management such as vehicle tracking and detection of vehicle violations. The moving target detection technology in this study is based on the YOLOv3 algorithm. It implements moving vehicle tracking by means of Mean-Shift and Kalman filtering. In this paper, the Gaussian background difference technology is used to analyze the illegal behavior of the vehicle, and the color feature extraction technology is used to identify and locate the license plate, and the information of the illegal vehicle is entered into the database. The experiment compares the moving target detection of UAV vision and the traditional target detection in four aspects: recognition accuracy, recognition speed, manual time, and divergent results. The results show that the average accuracy rates of UAV vision-based moving target detection and traditional pattern recognition are 98.4% and 87.8%, respectively. The recognition speeds are 24.9 (vehicles/sec) and 10.6 (vehicles/sec), respectively. However, the artificial time and divergence results of moving target detection based on UAV vision are only 1/3 of the traditional mode. The moving target detection based on UAV vision has a better moving target detection ability.  © 2022 Sining Cheng et al.","","Aircraft detection; Crime; Feature extraction; License plates (automobile); Object detection; Optical character recognition; Detection of moving object; Detection technology; High mobility; Machine-vision; Moving target detection; Moving vehicle tracking; Recognition speed; Targets detection; Technology-based; Traffic management; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135271277"

For managing them, logically centralized management such as Software-defined Network (SDN) is more beneficial than conventional distributed and ad hoc management approaches in terms of performance, scalability, and flexibility. However, the security issues for centralized management of heterogeneous IoT systems have not been explored well. The existing centralized security countermeasures are not enhancing IoT's security issues, mainly due to the control path vulnerability. Specifically, a wormhole attack is one of the most challenging yet detrimental security issues in IoT. Attackers can easily manipulate the centralized SDN controllers by spoofing the wireless control messages. In particular, if a wormhole attacker can exploit spoofing attacks against SDN controllers, SDN is hard to detect the wormhole attackers.This paper proposes a novel wormhole countermeasure algorithm named an ML-AWARE (Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Wormhole Attack Resonance) against attackers with various intelligent spoofing capabilities. ML-AWARE proposes a double-step k-means clustering for identifying wormhole attackers, denoising scattered errors and classifying the core area of the wormhole attackers. By clustering with the neighbor counts, ML-AWARE exploits the distance between clusters, concentration patterns, and the size of a cluster. We conducted detailed research using both analysis and simulations. Our simulation results show that ML-AWARE can identify wormhole attackers and counter numerous intelligent wormhole attacks without requiring special devices. © 2022 IEEE.","IoT; ML; SDN; Security; wormhole attack","Computer crime; Controllers; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Car platoon; Centralised; Centralized management; Machine learning approaches; ML; Security; Security issues; Software-defined networks; Wireless devices; Wormhole attack; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153405757"

Human mobility data contains rich but abundant information, which yields to the comprehensive region embeddings for cross domain tasks. In this paper, we propose multi-graph fusion networks (MGFN) to enable the cross domain prediction tasks. First, we integrate the graphs with spatio-temporal similarity as mobility patterns through a mobility graph fusion module. Then, in the mobility pattern joint learning module, we design the multi-level cross-attention mechanism to learn the comprehensive embeddings from multiple mobility patterns based on intra-pattern and inter-pattern messages. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets.

This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contacts' conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.  © 2014 IEEE.","Device security; Internet of Vehicles (IoV); position forging attack; smart city; traffic prediction; vehicular communications","Crime; Digital storage; Markov processes; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Central locations; Distributed schemes; Semi markov process; Spatial dependencies; Storage limitation; Theoretical modeling; Traffic management systems; Validation results; Vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107347158"

We developed four Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) models to understand the influence of latent perceptions on bicycling for commuting and non-commuting (i.e., grocery shopping, going for tea, and recreational) trips. The analysis indicates that women are more likely to choose a bike for commuting trips but are less likely to use bikes for recreational trips. The results also show that the choice of commuting by bicycle is positively associated with commuting distance and negatively associated with residential land use. Walkability perception has a significant positive association with the choice of bikes for commuting and non-commuting trips.

The results do not support the idea that a more meritocratic ethos at the country level would create the connection between inequality and punishment. On the contrary, they suggest the persistence of a systemic link independently of attitudinal variables. However, by showing that, the greater the inequality, the more the population calls for redistributive intervention by the state, and the more it also calls for punitive intervention, the findings could suggest another pattern.

For example, fraud gangs are usually organized to purchase commodities at low prices in e-commerce promotions. They benefit from the price spread by reselling commodities at high prices. In the past few years, the transaction fraud caused serious financial losses to merchants in e-commerce platform. To detect the fraudulent user and behavior effectively, a multiview graph clustering-based abnormal detection model is developed in this paper. In the proposed model, two fraudulent behavior patterns are proposed by abstracting the e-commerce network as a heterogeneous information graph. On this basis, two user-similarity graphs are reorganized from the heterogeneous graph with the help of different metapaths. Subsequently, in order to capture the corresponding fraudulent behavior patterns, the above two graphs are encoded into user embeddings and assigned to specific clusters in respective views. Finally, the consensus detection result is produced by fusing the complementary information of different views in a joint multiview learning framework. As we know, our work is the first one that uses multiview graph clustering in e-commerce fraud detection, which will provide a new research perspective for fraud detection in e-commerce platform. Extensive experiments are conducted on real and semisynthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.  © 2022 HangYuan Du et al.","","Behavioral research; Costs; Losses; Mobile commerce; Behaviour patterns; Commerce platforms; Continuous development; E- commerces; E-commerce transactions; Fraud detection; Graph clustering; Mobile e-commerce; Multi-views; User detection; Crime","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136665528"

Five distinct components of criminal nomadism (i.e., trips, nodes, paths, range, and mesolevel activity space), inspired by crime pattern theory, are suggested and analyzed. Results: Results show that criminal nomadism is the reality of young and educated Whites who have a prolific criminal career interspersed with long incarceration sentences. Nomadic offenders did not wander freely and randomly, but rather seemed to be looking for opportunities and privacy. Sex-offending variables did not make a significant contribution to predictions, suggesting that criminal nomadism is more a general offending phenomenon than something specific to sex offending. Conclusions: This study provides supporting evidence that an extensive criminal career is generally associated with a geographically scattered and nomadic lifestyle.

With applications ranging from personalized recommendations to criminal activity detection, TUL has received increasing attention over the past five years. While research has focused mainly on learning deep representations that capture complex spatio-temporal mobility patterns unique to individual users, we demonstrate that visit patterns are highly unique among users and thus simple heuristics applied directly to the raw data are sufficient to solve TUL. More specifically, we demonstrate that a single check-in per trajectory is enough to correctly predict the identity of the user up to 85% of the time. Moreover, by using a non-parametric classifier, we scale up TUL to over 100k users which is an increase over state-of-theart by three orders of magnitude. Extensive empirical analysis on four real-world datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare, Gowalla and Weeplaces) compares our findings to state-of-the-art results, and more importantly validates our claim that TUL is easier than commonly believed. © 2022 IEEE.","LBSNs; mobility classification","Deep learning; Activity detection; Check-in; Classification tasks; Criminal activities; LBSN; Mobility classification; Mobility pattern; Personalized recommendation; Simple heuristics; Spatio-temporal; Trajectories","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147966461"

However, defining a neighborhood and its aggregation scales are difficult challenges for the studies using neighborhood characteristics. Previous studies generally adopted fixed administrative units as the neighborhood and chose the same scale for all the variables due to data availability. Aggregation scales have a significant influence on examining the relationships between area-based input variables and outcome variables, but how to optimize the scale for each variable has been less investigated. This study proposes a multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework for simultaneously determining the optimal scale for each neighborhood environment variable and building an optimized multiscale model. First, we developed multiscale extraction methods for the socioeconomic and built environment characteristics within overlapping neighborhoods based on different types of data, including fine-grained mobile phone user data and point of interest data. Next, we proposed a random forest-based scale optimization method to quantify the impact of scales and determined an optimal spatial scale for each variable. Third, we used urban burglary risk modeling as an example, to demonstrate the usefulness of the scale optimization method. In the comparison, the model using an optimized multiscale feature set (R2 = 0.843, F1 score = 0.797 for high-risk samples) achieved better accuracy than all the models using fixed-scale combination feature sets. Moreover, the results revealed that there might be differences in the optimal scale of different neighborhood environment characteristics and demonstrated the effectiveness of our scale optimization method. Our multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework is well suited for assessing the neighborhood effect in social sciences. © 2021 The Authors","Mobile phone user data; Multiscale feature; Neighborhood effect; Spatial scale sensitivity","algorithm; mobile phone; neighborhood; optimization; pattern recognition; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic status","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121630859"

However, extant literature on serial homicide and geographic mobility is scarce, specifically lacking a comprehensive appraisal of relative research. To gain a better understanding of the geographic mobility patterns of serial homicide offenders, we must determine the current status of literature in this area, to figure out where to go in terms of future research. Therefore, the following study is a scoping review of existing literature on geographic mobility and serial homicide and four associated typologies (Holmes & DeBurger’s Geographic typology, Hickey’s Mobility typology, Canter’s Circle typology, and Rossmo’s Hunting Style typology) to achieve the following: (1) Comprehensively evaluate literature regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and four associated typologies to establish the current status of research; (2) uncover potential literature gaps; and (3) provide future research recommendations. Literature sources (N = 43) on serial homicide and geographic mobility (1985–2018) were examined. While findings recognize the relevance of mobility functions in serial homicide investigations, gaps in literature were evident regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and the four associated typologies. Findings also reveal that systematic research in this field is limited.

When such violations occur on fishing boats, they fall under the rubric of “fisheries crime.” Political scientists and economists have tended to assume that these criminal fishers simply abandon their legal occupation and take up illegal practices, labelled “transnational organized fisheries crime” by the United Nations. On the other hand, some scholars have also argued that subsidized and militarized fishers in the South China Sea are simply acting as instruments of their states’ geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations, non-enforcement of regulations, and incentives. Such present-centric approaches both obscure the modalities of fishers’ embodied skills and knowledge and their motivations, and downplay the inter-ethnic networks that connected different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting the spike in maritime trespass in (and out of) the South China Sea, this article combines ethnography and historiography to show how fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader, smuggler, and militia. I propose the concept of occupational slippage as a way of going beyond the fiction of fishing as mono-occupational and theorizing the realities of fishers as mobile maritime actors who enact and conceal multiple—simultaneous and consecutive—livelihood strategies while navigating not just seas, but also markets and territorial sovereignties. Thus, I argue that the fishers’ practices reflect wider interconnections between modern, state-supported, and technology-driven fisheries with older pre-nation-state patterns of mobility and knowledge accumulated through generations, producing new forms of versatility that operate under the states’ radars. © 2022, Institute for Ethnographic Research.

It is advantageous to track goods in real-time by web-based registration and authentication of products after any substantial change or relocation. Despite recent advantages in technology-based tracking systems, most supply chains still rely on plainly printed tags such as barcodes and Quick Response (QR) codes for tracking purposes. Although affordable and efficient, these tags convey no security against counterfeit and cloning attacks, raising privacy concerns. It is a critical matter since a few security breaches in merchandise databases in recent years has caused crucial social and economic impacts such as identity loss, social panic, and loss of trust in the community. This paper considers an end-to-end system using dendrites as nano-resolution visual identifiers to secure supply chains. Dendrites are formed by generating fractal metallic patterns on transparent substrates through an electrochemical process, which can be used as secure identifiers due to their natural randomness, high entropy, and unclonable features. The proposed framework compromises the back-end program for identification and authentication, a web-based application for mobile devices, and a cloud database. We review architectural design, dendrite operational phases (personalization, registration, inspection), a lightweight identification method based on 2D graph-matching, and a deep 3D image authentication method based on Digital Holography (DH). A two-step search is proposed to make the system scalable by limiting the search space to samples with high similarity scores in a lower-dimensional space. We conclude by presenting our solution to make dendrites secure against adversarial attacks. © 2022 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; cybersecurity; nano-scaled patterns; supply chain","Application programs; Authentication; Cloning; Computer crime; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Data privacy; Electronic commerce; Embedded systems; Online systems; Websites; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems; Intelligent transportation; Nano resolution; Nano-scaled pattern; Online shopping; Real- time; Secure monitoring; Web based; Supply chains","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171997068"

Using Bayesian structural time-series models, the authors study the changes in two metrics of criminal activity–crime registration and distress calls. In addition to absolute changes, the authors analyse the relative changes in one metric with respect to the other during two stay-at-home orders across six categories of crimes: property offences; offences against the human body; cases of missing persons and unidentified dead bodies; vehicle- and traffic-related offences; crimes against women, children and elders; and emerging crimes. While there was an overall decrease in most types of crime, results show that each category was impacted by restrictions in human mobility in different ways; emerging crimes, in particular, increased significantly during both periods. The crime and call trends exhibited a synchronous pattern with respect to a majority of offences except in the category of crimes against women and missing persons, where a contrary trend of decreasing crime registrations and increasing distress calls was noticed during the partial lockdown period. This finding highlights inherent inadequacies such as under-reporting of crimes by victims and non-registration of crime by the police. Understanding these inadequacies could potentially enhance preparedness leading to improved public service delivery by reordering priorities. Breaking down these trends at a crime-specific level assists law enforcement practitioners in gaining insights on crime motivators and enablers, thus contributing towards more effective crime prevention under ordinary circumstances. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian inference; causal impact; coronavirus; Crime registration; distress calls; stay-at-home orders","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122707382"

Therefore, MMMAs become more and more popular. However, the prevalence of MMMAs also makes them a hotbed for cybercrime. Among them, “Click Farming” fraud requires special attention, as it causes substantial pecuniary losses and is challenging to detect. In this paper, we describe Multi-view Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (MHT-GNN), a framework for detecting “Click Farming” fraudsters in a popular MMMA called WeChat. We first adopt a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph (HTG) to model spatial, heterogeneous and temporal information contained in MM-MA data. We then extract two different types of user history sequences as two “views” of user behavior patterns from HTG. MHT-GNN contains a pretraining phase and a detection phase. The main components in MHT-GNN include Inductive Heterogeneous GNN Encoder, Temporal Snapshot Sequence Encoder, and User Relation Sequence Encoder. The first encoder aims to capture spatial information and the heterogeneity in each snapshot of HTG. The later two encoders are designed to incorporate temporal information to better reveal user’s behavior patterns and MHT-GNN leverages them to capture the two different views of user history behavior data. We conduct experiments on a real-world, million-scale dynamic graph extracted from WeChat. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MHT-GNN: it significantly exceeds existing detection methods, and it is able to block “Click Farming” fraud activities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Click farming detection; Graph based anomaly detection; Graph neural network; Multi-purpose messaging mobile app","Behavioral research; Crime; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Message passing; Signal encoding; Anomaly detection; Click farming detection; Graph based anomaly detection; Graph neural networks; Graph-based; Mobile app; Multi-purpose; Multi-purpose messaging mobile app; Multi-views; Temporal graphs; Anomaly detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144262899"

Developing a fast-paced identifier of these patterns tends to help in detecting fraud beforehand with higher accuracy. The project is an analysis of how different algorithms and their combinations behave while detecting fraud. We used an Automobile insurance claim data-set operated under various algorithms like XG-Boost, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Bernoulli NB, Bagging Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Ada-Boost Classifier, Random Forest Algorithm, K Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression Algorithm. The model responds better with XG-Boost followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis. This could be paired up with the idea that gradient-based algorithms work faster and are more accurate and can be integrated with an improvised model sequencing the algorithms that predict fraud with minimum fallback.  © 2022 IEEE.","Accuracy; Classifier; Fraud; Gradient; Pattern","Crime; Discriminant analysis; Insurance; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; Accuracy; Algorithmics; Analysis of various; Divergents; Financial fraud; Fraud; Gradient; Linear discriminant analyze; Nonsingular; Pattern; Decision trees","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146309465"

This paper uses an original dataset on the prosecution of mayors in large Russian cities to examine the factors that make elites more likely to be arrested. We argue that in electoral authoritarian regimes like Russia, regime leaders are reluctant to arrest popular officials. Such officials command political capital that is useful to the regime, and arrests of prominent officials can produce popular backlash. We examine this argument using an original dataset on all arrests of municipal leaders in Russia’s 221 largest cities between 2002 and 2018. We find that mayors who won their elections by large margins are less likely to be arrested. In addition, we document several other substantively important patterns: (1) a mayor’s professional background is not related to the likelihood of arrest, (2) opposition mayors are four times more likely to be arrested, and (3) mobilization of votes for the regime is not protective against arrest.

Therefore, this study adopts the theories of crime opportunities, such as routine activity theory, rational choice and crime pattern to expound on the incidence of armed banditry in Nigeria. It was found out that opportunities play a role in banditry; the phenomenon is concentrated in time and space; the opportunities for the menace is highly specific and that the incidence produces opportunities for other crimes.

Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers’ crime location choices, but not native robbers’. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers.

The influx of capital attracts increasing fraudsters to defraud money from advertisers. Fraudsters can leverage many techniques, where bots install fraud is the most difficult to detect due to its ability to emulate normal users by implementing sophisticated behavioral patterns to evade from detection rules defined by human experts. Therefore, we proposed BotSpot1 for bots install fraud detection previously. However, there are some drawbacks in BotSpot, such as the sparsity of the devices' neighbors, weak interactive information of leaf nodes, and noisy labels. In this work, we propose BotSpot++ to improve these drawbacks: (1) for the sparsity of the devices' neighbors, we propose to construct a super device node to enrich the graph structure and information flow utilizing domain knowledge and a clustering algorithm; (2) for the weak interactive information, we propose to incorporate a self-Attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of various leaf nodes; and (3) for the noisy labels, we apply a label smoothing mechanism to alleviate it. Comprehensive experimental results show that BotSpot++ yields the best performance compared with six state-of-The-Art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy our model to the advertising platform of Mobvista,2 a leading global mobile advertising company. The online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Today, in Ukraine there is no centralized scalable system for collecting and processing video data, which would allow controlling the roadway and roadside environment. Problem Statement. Video surveillance systems, as a rule, use stationary cameras. Since there are many cameras employed in this kind of systems, there are problems related to transferring information (creating and maintaining a data network) and processing (creating datacenters for processing and storing received data). Purpose. The purpose of this research is to create a video collection system for control of a roadway and roadside environment, as well as an environment into the municipal transport to help detect crimes committed in the surveillance zones. Material and Methods. In this research, there has been used a smartphone and a camera for testing the functions and algorithms of our proposed system. To reduce the size of data to be processed, we have used the methods for the selective perception of video information, the detection of moving objects, the parallel and conveyor processing of video information to accelerate its processing, as well as the methods and means of rapid release of informative patterns for searching and recognizing objects. Results. The concept and structure of the hardware and software of the mobile video surveillance system have been developed, the system has been protected by the patent of Ukraine for a utility model; a new type camera for shooting and analyzing video data has been designed and created (in cooperation with a partner); the software components of the system for the automatic detection of license plates and their recognition and the automatic detection of people without a masks inside a public transport for the further data analysis have been developed. Conclusions. Using mobile systems of this type allows expanding video surveillance zone in cities and outsides and reducing costs of road video surveillance systems. © 2022 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

This has in turn hindered the potential to study fraudulent patterns in mobile money transactions so as to propose realistic mitigation measures based on Machine Learning Approaches to the prevailing financial fraud challenges in the region. This research presents mobile money scenarios that should be considered in order to implement a simulator that can harness synthetic datasets for mobile money transactions from Sub-Saharan Africa so as to carry out fraud detection research. These scenarios include the definition of a mobile money ecosystem with processes used by actors such as mobile money agents, clients, merchants and banks to interact with each other in mobile money operations. There is also a need for a real mobile money dataset to extract statistical information and diverse fraudulent behaviours of actors and fraud examples in mobile money markets. This research uses the design considerations to examine process-driven techniques such as numerical simulation, agent-based modeling, and data-driven techniques such as neural networks that can be leveraged to generate synthetic datasets for mobile money transactions. Common data generation toolkits like PaySim, AMLSim, RetSim and ABIDES that are based on these techniques have been examined. The design considerations are used to design a realistic model known as MoMTSim based on real mobile money processes and agent-based modeling techniques that can be implemented to generate synthetic transaction datasets for mobile money with fraud instances. This will facilitate fraud detection research. The synthetic datasets eliminate data privacy risks, are easy and faster to obtain, and are cheap to experiment with. With the proposed model, different research groups can move to the implementation stage to realise a model for synthetic data generation for mobile money transactions from the Sub-Saharan region.  © 2022 ACM.","agent-based modeling; datasets; fraud detection; Mobile money; synthetic data","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Crime; Data privacy; Electronic money; Mobile agents; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Dataset; Design considerations; Fraud detection; Mobile money; Money transactions; Scenario-based; Sub-saharan africa; Synthetic data; Synthetic datasets; Design","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134889950"

Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods: We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results: The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion: Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted. © 2021, The Author(s).","Crime pattern theory; Discrete spatial choice; Routine activities; Time of day; Time-specific Activity Space (TAS) survey","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100111701"

However, the current research reveals little about the spatial differences among different age groups of criminals when they choose crime locations. Using kernel density estimation and discrete spatial choice models in ZG City, China, this study aims to explore the spatial variation in crime location choices of street robbers at different ages. We also examine the different influences of activity nodes, supervision role, and social disorganization on crime location choice. The results demonstrate that there are significant spatial differences in crime location choices by street robbers at different ages. Juvenile robbers tend to commit crimes in labor-intensive industrial clusters and primary and secondary school areas, young adult robbers tend to commit crimes only in labor-intensive industrial clusters, and adult robbers prefer urban areas with transportation hubs. Additionally, this study demonstrates that age-related activity nodes, the supervision role of the ambient population, and the proportion of youngsters are the main factors for such spatial differences. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Cybercafés have impact on crime location choices of juvenile and young adult robbers, while transportation hubs affect those of young adult and adult robbers, and bars and schools influence all the three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. (2) The supervision role exerted by the ambient population is greater for young adult and adult robbers compared with juvenile robbers. (3) Young adult robbers are more likely to target communities with more youngsters but juvenile and adult robbers are not. (4) Journey to crime has a significant negative effect on target choices, especially on juvenile robbers. In addition, these findings have great informative value for crime prevention and social governance. For example, (i) in labor-intensive industrial clusters where juvenile robbers frequently commit crimes, we can regulate the number of age-related activity nodes such as cybercafés and bars; (ii) in transportation hubs and their surrounding communities where adult robbers commit crimes intensively, we can encourage the persistence of the ambient population to persist and play a better supervision role; (iii) in communities predominated by youth population, we can survey delinquent juveniles to enhance the precise guidance and support. © 2022, Science Press.

Thus, the existing centralized algorithms are not suitable for the big data environment, where data cannot be handled by a single machine. In this paper, our main aim is to find out the Spatio-temporal sequential patterns from the event data set using a distributed framework suitable for mining big data. We proposed two distributed algorithms, namely, MR-STBFM (MapReduce based spatio-temporal breadth first miner), and MR-SPTreeSTBFM (MapReduce based sequential pattern tree spatio-temporal breadth first miner). These are the distributed algorithms for mining spatio-temporal sequential patterns using Hadoop MapReduce framework. A spatio-temporal tree structure is used in MR-SPTreeSTBFM for reducing the candidate generation cost. This is an extension to the proposed MR-STBFM algorithm. The tree structure significantly improves the performance of the proposed approach. Also, the top-most significant pattern approach has been proposed to mine the top-most significant sequential patterns. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on the Boston crime dataset. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Data mining; MapReduce framework; Sequential pattern mining; Spatio temporal sequences","Data mining; Miners; Trees (mathematics); Breadth-first; Map-reduce; Mapreduce frameworks; Pattern trees; Sequential patterns; Sequential-pattern mining; Single- machines; Spatio temporal sequence; Spatio-temporal; Temporal sequences; MapReduce","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130253351"

We propose a fingerprint deblurring model FDeblur-GAN, based on the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and multi-stage framework of the stack GAN. Additionally, we integrate two auxiliary sub-networks into the model for the deblurring task. The first sub-network is a ridge extractor model. It is added to generate ridge maps to ensure that fingerprint information and minutiae are preserved in the deblurring process and prevent the model from generating erroneous minutiae. The second sub-network is a verifier that helps the generator to preserve the ID information during the generation process. Using a database of blurred fingerprints and corresponding ridge maps, the deep network learns to deblur from the input blurry samples. We evaluate the proposed method in combination with two different fingerprint matching algorithms. We achieved an accuracy of 95.18% on our fingerprint database for the task of matching deblurred and ground truth fingerprints. &copy; 2021 IEEE. © 2021 IEEE.","","Biometrics; Pattern matching; Adversarial networks; Automated identification systems; Fingerprint database; Fingerprint images; Fingerprint matching algorithm; Generation process; Low qualities; Mobile camera; Facsimile","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113329755"

Based on the rational choice theory and situational crime prevention, the variables were constructed based on two dimensions: “target factors in terrorism” and “terrorist attack factors in terrorism.” To achieve the purpose of this study, a negative binomial regression analysis was performed based on data from the Global Terrorism Database. Consequently, variables such as “exposure,” “protection capability,” “attack patterns (vehicle),” and “suicide terrorism” were verified for their statistically significant influence on “mass casualty terrorism (MCT).” This study suggests that it is necessary to design a preventive environment and arrange for personnel at each site that is vulnerable to terrorism to prevent MCT events from occurring inside facilities. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Exposure; Mass casualty terrorism (MCT); National security; Soft target terrorism; Suicide terrorism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096448386"

Being able to capture citizen mobility and delineate a crime-specific population denominator is a vital prerequisite of the endeavour to both explain and address crime. This paper introduces the concept of an exposed population-at-risk, defined as the mix of residents and non-residents who may play an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in a specific crime type, present in a spatial unit at a given time. This definition is deployed to determine the exposed population-at-risk for violent crime, associated with the night-time economy, in public spaces. Through integrating census data with mobile phone data and utilising fine-grained temporal and spatial violent crime data, the paper demonstrates the value of deploying an exposed (over an ambient) population-at-risk denominator to determine violent crime in public space hotspots on Saturday nights in Greater Manchester (UK). In doing so, the paper illuminates that as violent crime in public space rises, over the course of a Saturday evening, the exposed population-at-risk falls, implying a shifting propensity of the exposed population-at-risk to perform active roles as offenders, victims and/or guardians. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and policy relevance of these findings. © 2020, The Author(s).","Exposed population-at-risk; Mobile phone data; Night-time economy; Public space; Routine activity theory; Violent crime","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086877674"

In this study, we take an initial step towards the detection and large-scale measurement of the click farm based invalid traffic. Our study begins with a measurement on the device's features using a real-world labeled dataset, which reveals a series of features distinguishing the fraudulent devices from the benign ones. Based on these features, we develop EvilHunter, a system for detecting fraudulent devices through ad bid request logs with a focus on clustering fraudulent devices. EvilHunter functions by 1) building a classifier to distinguish fraudulent and benign devices; 2) clustering devices based on app usage patterns; and 3) relabeling devices in clusters through majority voting. EvilHunter demonstrates 97% precision and 95% recall on a real-world labeled dataset. By investigating a super click farm, we reveal several cheating strategies that are commonly adopted by fraudulent clusters. We further reduce the overhead of EvilHunter and discuss how to deploy the optimized EvilHunter in a real-world system. We are in partnership with a leading ad verification company to integrate EvilHunter into their industrial platform. © 2021 ACM.","ad fraud; click farm; invalid traffic","Ad fraud; Advertizing; Click farm; Clusterings; Invalid traffic; Labeled dataset; Programmatics; Real- time; Real-world; Through the lens; Crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119331247"

In an IoT network, there can be an overwhelming number of massively connected devices, all of which must be able to communicate to each other with low latency to provide a positive user experience. Various protocols exist to allow for this connectivity, and are vulnerable to attack due to their simple nature. These attacks seek to disrupt or deny communications in the network by taking advantage of these vulnerabilities. These attacks include Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding and Scheduling attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to prevent these routing attacks exist, and have begun to incorporate Deep Learning (DL) to bring near perfect accuracy of detection of attackers. The DL approach opens up the IDS to the possibility of being the victim of an Adversarial Machine Learning attack. We explore the case of a novel evasion attack applied to a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) dataset for subversion of the IDS. Additionally, we explore possible mitigations for the proposed evasion attack, through adversarial example training, outlier detection, and a combination of the two. By using the combination, we are able to reduce the possible attack space by nearly two orders of magnitude. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adversarial machine learning; Intrusion detection systems; IoT; On-demand routing","Computer crime; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Network security; Wireless sensor networks; Adversarial machine learning; Black holes; Grayhole; Intrusion Detection Systems; Low latency; On-demand routing; Routing topology; Simple++; Traffic pattern; Users' experiences; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127817785"

Exponential growth and unconditional access to Internet and mobile computing have added to this. It is in this context that police forces around the world are migrating to predictive policing. This move will aid them in informed decision-making leading to better enforcement of law and order. Using machine learning algorithms, law enforcement agencies can now extract specific patterns of crime and criminal behaviour from spatio-temporal data to determine whether a freshly committed crime relates to an existing pattern or not. With this knowledge, the administrators would be better equipped to map crime to criminals. Further, they can use the data for forecasting, which, in turn, will enable them to deploy resources judiciously. This can even aid in prevention of crimes or help efficient tackling of crimes.

While the method has been around for several decades, few studies have provided any research findings using it. There are two likely reasons for Winthropping being under-used: first, it has not been clearly, theoretically explained; second, given its relative novelty, it may not be immediately clear how to use it in research and real-world scenarios. The current paper outlines several key psychological (e.g., satisficing and affordances) and criminological (e.g., rational choice theory and crime geometry) theories that may explain why Winthropping works. Case studies are provided, and a methodological approach (matrix forecasting) is then provided to show how it could work in research practice and real-world applications.

In an RTA, often the thoracic injuries go unnoticed and are overlooked because of the resilient nature of the thoracic wall, which leads to the late detection of injuries and their fatal outcomes. Aim of the study: To evaluate the pattern of thoracic injuries in RTA and to find out the epidemiological parameters involved in RTA. Materials and Methods: In this autopsy based cross-sectional study, 85 victims of fatal RTA were studied between 1st July 2019 to 31st December 2020 in the mortuary of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. All the fatal RTA cases coming for autopsy were included in the study except decomposed and mutilated cases. Result: In this study, male two-wheeler drivers, belonging to the age group 21-40 years were most vulnerable to RTAs. Maximum number of RTAs were reported during Winter season. Inter-city roads witnessed majority of the RTAs and two-wheelers were the most common offending agent. Most of the RTAs occurred during late evening i.e., 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Forty-three victims had chest injury after a RTA. Abrasion was the most common external chest injury followed by contusion. Fracture of thoracic skeleton was the major internal chest injury followed by chest wall contusion and injury to vital intrathoracic organ. 58 % of the victims, who had chest injury, had a fractured rib. 37 % of the RTA victims had collection in the pleural cavity either in the form of Hemothorax or Pneumothorax. Lung was the most common vital intrathoracic organ to be injured in RTA. Head injury was the most common cause of death followed by hemorrhage and shock. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of increasing road safety awareness, strictly enforcing traffic rules, establishing an advanced trauma response system, and providing well-equipped mobile ambulatory service to reduce the morbidity and mortality resulting from road traffic accidents. © 2022, Institute of Medico-legal Publication.

A distributed wormhole attack over the federated IoT system is one of the most challenging security issues, where a group of secret attackers can easily exploit the centralized controllers with various wireless control messages. This paper presents an ML-Defense (Machine Learning for building a Dependable Federated Network System) against various intelligent wormhole attacks. Using an unsupervised learning algorithm, ML-Defense identifies different wormhole attacker patterns and locations. Our simulation results indicate that ML-Defense can cluster the attackers' location without requiring special devices and pinpoints the core of the attackers by examining the suspicious area.  © 2022 IEEE.","Federation; IoT; ML; SDN; Security; wormhole attack","5G mobile communication systems; Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network security; End to end; Federation; Machine-learning; ML; Network platforms; Network systems; SDN; Security; Security issues; Wormhole attack; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143254964"

However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice mostly considers the impact of the built environment and social environment, without considering the impact of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery and its temporal difference. To fill this gap, this study integrated ambient population and surveillance cameras in assessing street robbers' decision making and its time effects in ZG City of China, by using the discrete spatial choice modeling. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant negative impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a protective role in preventing street robbers' criminal activities. Interestingly, we found that the protective effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. The protective role of ambient population and surveillance cameras is stable daily through the week, but diurnally, the influence of ambient population shows temporal fluctuation, while the impact of surveillance cameras is temporally stable. These findings can be of some reference for police control and crime geography research by: 1) Carrying out the experimental evaluation of surveillance camera system's prevention and control effect, and dynamic optimization and adjustment of surveillance cameralocations. 2) Arranging a suitable amount of mixed functional land in urban planning or urban renewal to strengthen the moderation of ambient population through planning or management. 3) Focusing on diurnal variability in future studies of the time effects. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

The New York City subway system is the busiest in the USA, with an annual ridership estimated at 1.8 billion people. Key findings of this research include noteworthy relationships between robbery hot spots and subway stations, as well as substantial reductions in robbery frequency during temporary subway station closures, with larger reductions occurring in closer proximities to the subway stations. There was also a significant robbery pattern “normalization process” that occurred after the closed subway stations were reopened where robbery frequency returned to historically “normal” pre-closure levels. These notable decreases of crime in and around subway stations during the station closure time periods, as well as the prominent increases in robbery when subway stations reopened, should be taken into consideration when planning transit maintenance, conducting crime prevention initiatives, and scheduling crime control strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Crime normalization hypothesis; Crime reduction; Hot spots; New York City; Robbery; Subway crime; Subway station; Transit crime","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100479830"

In 2014, new “end-demand” legislation criminalized new aspects of sex work in Canada (e.g., third-party advertising, purchasing) while leaving the sale of sex legal. Utilizing data from a longitudinal community-based cohort of women sex workers in Metro Vancouver (An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access [AESHA], 2010-2016), we used kernel density mapping to understand and identify geographic patterns of workplace neighborhood mobility (i.e., changing the primary neighborhood in which one worked in the last 6 months); multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was also used to model contextual (policing, violence, and safety) and individual correlates of workplace mobility among sex workers over the 6-year period, including potential changes in mobility patterns pre- and post-end-demand criminalization. A total of 543 sex workers were included in analyses, contributing 2,199 observations. A total of 402 (74.0%) experienced workplace neighborhood mobility during the study period. Neighborhood mobility was negatively correlated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98/year older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.97, 0.99]) and positively correlated with homelessness (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = [1.12, 1.82]), identifying as a gender/sexual minority (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.70]), and servicing clients primarily outdoors (vs. informal indoor or in-call venues; AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = [1.21, 1.81]); police harassment (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI = [0.96, 1.48], p =.11) and changing one’s neighborhood of work due to safety concerns (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = [0.94, 2.00], p =.09) were both marginally correlated.

The proposed postmortem iris segmentation approach outperforms the state of the art and - in addition to iris annulus, as in case of classical iris segmentation methods - detects abnormal regions caused by eye decomposition processes, such as furrows or irregular specular highlights present on the drying and wrinkling cornea. The method was trained and validated with data acquired from 171 cadavers, kept in mortuary conditions, and tested on subject-disjoint data acquired from 259 deceased subjects. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of data used in postmortem iris recognition research to date. The source code of the proposed method are offered with the paper.

A major threat to this ecosystem's long-term health is click fraud, which involves clicking on ads while infected with malware or using an automated bot to do it for you. The methods used to identify click fraud now focus on looking at server requests. Although these methods have the potential to produce huge numbers of false negatives, they may easily be avoided if clicks are hidden behind proxies or distributed globally. AdSherlock is a customer-side (inside the app) efficient and deployable click fraud detection system for mobile applications that we provide in this work. AdSherlock separates the computationally expensive click request identification procedures into an offline and online approach. AdSherlock uses URL (Uniform Resource Locator) tokenization in the Offline phase to create accurate and probabilistic patterns. These models are used to identify click requests online, and an ad request tree model is used to detect click fraud after that. In order to develop and evaluate the AdSherlock prototype, we utilise actual applications. It injects the online detector directly into an executable software package using binary instrumentation technology (BIT). The findings show that AdSherlock outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for detecting click fraud with little false positives.

Dentition are informative in an investigation where acid is used as a means of body disposal, as teeth are more likely to survive intact. Importantly, researchers studying acid immersion have not observed immature dentition, nor have they analyzed immature acid-treated teeth using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This study analyzes the effects of HCl on immature human molars, with two goals: understanding the timing and nature of physical changes to immature molars caused by HCl immersion, and aiding in the identification and age determination of dental tissues partially or nearly completely destroyed using HCl. Our results indicated that immature human molars immersed in HCl follow a pattern of physical changes and decrease in weight as they dissolve similar to mature molars, although the timing of dissolution is affected by their smaller size and incompletely developed roots in a predictable way. With less root material present and an open root tip, we observed that HCl can more quickly penetrate the pulp cavity of immature molars. The mobile SEM images indicated immature and mature molars immersed in HCl exhibit similar changes at the microscopic level. Immature molars treated with HCl for over 18 h exhibited cracking features similar to those visible on mature molars that were difficult to differentiate from similar features on untreated teeth (both mature and immature) when images were taken at 3,000x or less. The appearance of features such as peeling layers and lamination at high magnification (6000x) were visible on both acid-treated mature and immature molars, but were not visible on untreated molars at the same level of magnification. By observing changes in the enamel and pulp cavity, it was possible to determine whether third molars were immature until approximately 18 h immersed in acid. At 42 h, it was no longer possible to determine whether the molars were immature. However, they were still easily identifiable as human teeth. In situations where teeth may no longer be identifiable macroscopically, we found that the laminating and peeling features observed on high magnification SEM imagery can be useful in characterizing acid treatment even on very small fragments of dental remains, potentially allowing investigators to determine if acid was used as a disposal method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine","Body disposal; Forensic anthropology; Forensic pathology; Forensic science; Hydrochloric acid; Immature dentition","Humans; Hydrochloric Acid; Immersion; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Molar; Molar, Third; Tooth Root; hydrochloric acid; hydrochloric acid; age determination; Article; body remains; body weight loss; criminalistics; dental procedure; dentition; forensic science; human; informed consent; molar tooth; permanent tooth; scanning electron microscopy; third molar; tooth extraction; tooth tissue; diagnostic imaging; immersion; molar tooth; scanning electron microscopy; tooth root","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131450820"

We aim to maximize the time-Averaged utility of users with a time-Averaged transmit power constraint on top of the EdgeSON architecture, which takes advantage of both centralized and distributed characteristics. We decompose the original long-Term problem into two-Time scales in which solving the problem of choosing beam pattern is run at a slower time scale than solving user scheduling and power allocation. Then, to solve user scheduling and power allocation, we leverage the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework which transforms an original long-Term average problem into per-slot modified sub-problems. Since provided per-slot problem to find a set of user scheduling and power allocation is known as NP-hard, we propose a low-complex and practical interference management algorithm, namely CRIM, by introducing two critical users with the highest interference channel gain in intra-BS and inter-BS respectively. Finally, via extensive simulations, we verify and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm and comparing algorithms in a real mmWave network environment. © 2022 IEEE.","beam ON/OFF scheduling; inter-beam interference; Lyapunov optimization; power allocation; user scheduling","5G mobile communication systems; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; Network layers; Optimization; Scheduling algorithms; Beam ON/OFF scheduling; Inter-beam interference; Interference management; Lyapunov optimization; Mm waves; Optimisations; Power allocations; Scheduling/allocation; Time-averaged; User scheduling; Scheduling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125655756"

Intervention arm B, where HIV incidence was reduced by 30%, followed national guidelines that mid trial (2016) changed from starting HIV treatment according to a CD4 threshold of 500 to universal treatment. Using social science data on the 21 communities, we consider how place (community context) might have influenced the primary outcome result. Methods: A social science component documented longitudinally the context of trial communities. Data were collected through rapid qualitative assessment, interviews, group discussions and observations. There were a total of 1547 participants and 1127 observations. Using these data, literature and a series of qualitative analysis steps, we identified key community characteristics of relevance to HIV and triangulated these with HIV community level incidence. Results: Two interdependent social factors were relevant to communities’ capability to manage HIV: stability/instability and responsiveness/resistance. Key components of stability were social cohesion; limited social change; a vibrant local economy; better health, education and recreational services; strong institutional presence; established middle-class residents; predictable mobility; and less poverty and crime. Key components of responsiveness were community leadership being open to change, stronger history of HIV initiatives, willingness to take up HIV services, less HIV-related stigma and a supported and enterprising youth population. There was a clear pattern of social factors across arms. Intervention arm A communities were notably more resistant and unstable. Intervention arm B communities were overall more responsive and stable. Conclusions: In the specific case of the dissonant primary outcome results from the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, the chance allocation of less stable, less responsive communities to arm A compared to arm B may explain some of the apparently smaller impact of the intervention in arm A. Stability and responsiveness appear to be two key social factors that may be relevant to secular trends in HIV incidence. We advocate for a systematic approach, using these factors as a framework, to community context in CRTs and monitoring HIV prevention efforts. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01900977.

Extensive studies identify click fraud according to click/traffic patterns based on dynamic analysis. However, in this study, we identify a novel click fraud, named humanoid attack, which can circumvent existing detection schemes by generating fraudulent clicks with similar patterns to normal clicks. We implement the first tool ClickScanner to detect humanoid attacks on Android apps based on static analysis and variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) with limited knowledge of fraudulent examples. We define novel features to characterize the patterns of humanoid attacks in the apps' bytecode level. ClickScanner builds a data dependency graph (DDG) based on static analysis to extract these key features and form a feature vector. We then propose a classification model only trained on benign datasets to overcome the limited knowledge of humanoid attacks. We leverage ClickScanner to conduct the first large-scale measurement on app markets (i.e., 120,000 apps from Google Play and Huawei AppGallery) and reveal several unprecedented phenomena. First, even for the top-rated 20,000 apps, ClickScanner still identifies 157 apps as fraudulent, which shows the prevalence of humanoid attacks. Second, it is observed that the ad SDK-based attack (i.e., the fraudulent codes are in the third-party ad SDKs) is now a dominant attack approach. Third, the manner of attack is notably different across apps of various categories and popularities. Finally, we notice there are several existing variants of the humanoid attack. Additionally, our measurements demonstrate the proposed ClickScanner is accurate and time-efficient (i.e., the detection overhead is only 15.35% of those of existing schemes). © 2021 ACM.","click fraud; humanoid attack; static analysis; variational autoencoders","Classification (of information); Crime; Learning systems; Losses; Auto encoders; Click fraud; Dynamics analysis; Financial loss; Humanoid attack; Mobile advertisement; ON dynamics; Pay per clicks; Traffic pattern; Variational autoencoder; Static analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119375804"

The spatial and temporal patterning of crime is, in part, reflective of this mobility, of the scale of the population present in any given setting at a particular time. It is also a function of capacity of this population to perform an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in any specific crime type, itself shaped by the time-variant activities undertaken in, and the qualities of, particular settings. To this end, this paper explores the intra-daily influence of activities and settings upon the weekday spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public spaces. This task is achieved through integrating a transient population dataset with travel survey, point-of-interest and recorded crime data in a study of Great Manchester (UK). The research deploys a negative binomial regression model controlling for spatial lag effects. It finds strong and independent, but time-variant, associations between leisure activities, leisure settings and the spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public space.

Therefore, digital evidence on mobile devices plays a more and more important role in crime investigations. Existing studies have designed tools to identify and/or extract digital evidence in the main memory or the file system of a mobile device. However, identifying and extracting digital evidence from the logging system of a mobile device is largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap.Specifically, we design, prototype, and evaluate LogExtractor, the first tool to automatically identify and extract digital evidence from log messages on an Android device. Given a log message, LogExtractor first determines whether the log message contains a given type of evidentiary data (e.g., GPS coordinates) and then further extracts the value of the evidentiary data if the log message contains it. Specifically, LogExtractor takes an offline-online approach. In the offline phase, LogExtractor builds an App Log Evidence Database (ALED) for a large number of apps via combining string and taint analysis to analyze the apps' code. Specifically, each record in the ALED contains 1) the string pattern of a log message that an app may write to the logging system, 2) the types of evidentiary data that the log message includes, and 3) the segment(s) of the string pattern that contains the value of a certain type of evidentiary data, where we represent a string pattern using a deterministic finite-state automaton. In the online phase, given a log message from a suspect's Android device, we match the log message against the string patterns in the ALED and extract evidentiary data from it if the matching succeeds. We evaluate LogExtractor on 65 benchmark apps from DroidBench and 12.1 K real-world apps. Our results show that a large number of apps write a diverse set of data to the logging system and LogExtractor can accurately extract them. © 2021 The Authors","Android log messages; Mobile app forensics; String analysis","Crime; Data mining; Digital devices; Digital forensics; Crime investigation; Deterministic finite state automata; Digital evidence; File systems; GPS Coordinates; Logging system; Main memory; Real-world; Android (operating system)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112513280"

Lacking other options, many turn to transit vehicles, stops, and stations for shelter. Many also ride public transit to reach various destinations. With affordable housing scarce and the numbers of unhoused individuals often surpassing the capacities of existing safety nets and support systems, transit operators face homelessness as a pressing issue on their systems and must implement policy measures from other realms beyond transportation to address it. Because of the health and safety implications for transit of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated further rise in homelessness from the resulting economic downturn, studying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable travelers is critical. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify articles discussing homelessness in transit systems. While only a handful of articles exist from the 1990s, there is an emerging literature in the last 20 years that examines different aspects of homelessness in transit systems. We identify and review 63 articles on homelessness in transit systems and other public settings to better understand the extent of homelessness in the U.S., and how transit agencies perceive its impacts. We also summarise literature findings on the travel patterns of unsheltered individuals, which show that public transit represents an important and common mode of travel for them. Lastly, we focus on responses to homelessness from the part of transit operators. We find two types of responses: 1) punitive, in which criminalisation, policing and enforcement of laws and codes of conduct prevail, and 2) outreach-related, which aim towards providing help and support to unsheltered individuals. We conclude by summarising our findings as well as the existing gaps in the literature. © 2021 The Author(s).

In the digital era, cloud computing has grown increasingly vital for scalable resource sharing, smooth computing, and information interchange. Researchers have a challenging task in securing cloud data, resources, applications, and infrastructure. Cloud security methods are used to protect the cloud in the cloud computing environment. Detective controls, for example, are critical in cloud security because they discover possible breaches and defend the cloud environment from attacks. This detective control mechanism is built using an intrusion detection system (IDS). The network traffic data utilised to build the IDS using a machine-learning algorithm has a major influence on the detection accuracy of the IDS. When the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to that of existing algorithms, it is observed that the new approach outperforms the others. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have become an important security tool for monitoring and researching network security in mobile cloud computing (MCC). However, several modern techniques still have flaws, such as high false positive rates, poor classification accuracies, and low true positive rates. This paper provides an intrusion detection strategy for MCC based on support vector machines (SVM) and information gain (IG). The suggested approach employs the SVM classifier to categories network data into normal and attack behaviours, and IG to choose the significant features and reduce the unnecessary features, because to the irrelevant and duplicated characteristics seen in KDD datasets. Because it can be accessible from anywhere on the internet, cloud storage has become the most popular data and information storage option. While it has its own set of advantages and benefits, its storage system protection has certain drawbacks. Cloud encryption ensures that cloud storage is secure, but it does not guarantee that the system will not be hacked. Cloud storage, like any other untrustworthy setting, demands the ability to safeguard shared data. This suggested solution gives access control to data handled in the cloud without contacting the vendor.  © 2022 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.","Attribute-based encryption; Cloud Protection Alliance; Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix; Local Binary Pattern; Support Vector Machine","Access control; Classification (of information); Cloud storage; Computer crime; Cryptography; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Local binary pattern; Mobile cloud computing; Network security; Attribute-based encryptions; Cloud protection alliance; Cloud storages; Cloud-computing; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Local binary patterns; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130071828"

In this study, we assess the relative importance of social, environmental, and amenity factors in urban peoples' destination choices within three countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) through an online survey. Concerns about safety and high living costs at potential destinations were among the most important factors in mobility decisions, whereas amenities were the least important.

The role of religious social capital in combating the drugs market in global drug policy has been less studied. This study provides a quite different view from most scholars who work for combating drug dealers by engaging participation of religious communities in rural society. The agency of teungku dayah succeeded in mobilizing the villagers due to the social capital that bonded the community based on religious ties. The article used live-in method, observation, in-depth and interviews to build a sociological imagination about the patterns of social practice of the people who become the subject of the research. The researchers lived in one of the villager's houses, participated in their discussions, listened to the gossip, worshipped with them and were involved in certain jobs carried out by the community members who targeted informants. Using religious social capital, this article argues that teungku dayah effectively used the social and religious capital of the Ujong Pacu community to conduct drug eradication. Religious social capital has strong ties in unifying elements of the people in the same religion, moreover it becomes an energy that keeps motivating the community to run anti-drugs movement and driving out the drug addicts in Ujong Pacu, Lhokseumawe-Aceh. © RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY 2020.","Aceh; Drug eradication; Islamic traditionalist scholars; Religious social capital","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088392628"

Several data revealed the ability of cancer cells to establish a favorable microenvironment, before their arrival in distant organs, by manipulating the cell composition and function of the new host tissue where cancer cells can survive and outgrow. This predetermined environment is termed “pre-metastatic niche” (pMN). pMN development requires that tumor-derived soluble factors, like cytokines, growth-factors and extracellular vesicles, genetically and epigenetically re-program not only resident cells (i.e., fibroblasts) but also non-resident cells such as bone marrow-derived cells. Indeed, by promoting an “emergency” myelopoiesis, cancer cells switch the steady state production of blood cells toward the generation of pro-tumor circulating myeloid cells defined as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) able to sustain tumor growth and dissemination. MDSCs are a heterogeneous subset of myeloid cells with immunosuppressive properties that sustain metastatic process. In this review, we discuss current understandings of how MDSCs shape and promote metastatic dissemination acting in each fundamental steps of cancer progression from primary tumor to metastatic disease. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Canè, Petrova, Sartoris, Ugel and De Sanctis.","immunosuppression; MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells); metastases; metastatic process; pre-metastatic niche","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytokine; danvatirsen; entinostat; epacadostat; gelatinase B; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; growth factor; high mobility group B1 protein; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; leronlimab; linrodostat; maraviroc; matrilysin; naringenin; pathogen associated molecular pattern; programmed death 1 ligand 1; protein kinase Fer; ruxolitinib; STAT3 protein; sunitinib; tadalafil; transcription factor FOXP3; transcription factor GATA 3; tumor necrosis factor; unindexed drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; vicriviroc; angiogenesis; antigen presenting cell; autoimmunity; bone marrow cell; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer growth; cancer mortality; cell composition; cell survival; epigenetics; exosome; fibroblast; human; human cell; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; metastasis; mouse; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; myelopoiesis; nasopharynx carcinoma; nonhuman; primary tumor; regulatory T lymphocyte; renal cell carcinoma; Review; steady state; T lymphocyte; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080886405"

The current criminalization of labor migration from the global South in Europe is disrupting long established patterns of upward mobility through international migration, that entailed remitting money home, getting married and reuniting with one’s family in the host country and moving up the socio-professional ladder from low-paid jobs to self employment. Instead, the life of an increasing number of Sikh migrants in France and elsewhere is marked by irregular status and socio-economic vulnerability. In this context, undocumented Sikh migrants try to assert their gender identity in multiple ways, characterized by homosociality, the importance of manual labor, specific forms of male sociability marked by the cultivation of their body, while remaining firmly grounded in a Sikh/Panjabi religious universe through seva (voluntary service) and gurdwara attendance. © 2020 by the author.

In these metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Seminal studies analyse crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large in a single city. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how violent and property crimes are related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods. To that end, we analyse crime at small areas and integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces to compare how the different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogotá, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another. Thus there is clearly no “one fits all” model. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Bayes Theorem; Boston; Built Environment; Chicago; Colombia; Crime; Culture; Humans; Los Angeles; Residence Characteristics; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; Bayes theorem; California; Colombia; crime; cultural anthropology; demography; epidemiology; human; Illinois; Massachusetts; social environment; socioeconomics; urban population","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089509805"

However, deeply located forms of compression would require proper identification to allow for adequate decompression. OBJECTIVE: To describe the usefulness of endoscopic visualization in one of the most challenging compression patterns in HFS, where the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) loop is severely indenting the brain stem at the proximal root exit zone of facial nerve along the pontomedullary sulcus. METHODS: Radiological and operative data were checked for all patients in whom severe indentation of the brainstem by PICA at pontomedullary sulcus was recorded and endoscope-assisted MVD was performed. Clinical correlation and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients with HFS were identified with radiological and surgical evidence proving brainstem indentation at the VII transitional zone. In 31 patients, PICA was the offending vessel to the facial nerve. In 3 patients, the PICA loop was mobilized under visualization of a 45◦ endoscope. A total of 31 patients had a mean follow-up duration of 52.1 mo. The mean duration between start of complaints and surgery was 7.2 yr. In the last follow-up, all patients had remarkable spasm improvement. A total of 5 patients had more than 90% disappearance of spasms and 26 patients experienced spasm-free outcome. CONCLUSION: Although severe indentation of brain stem implies morphological damage, outcome after MVD is excellent. A 45◦ endoscope is extremely helpful to identify compression down at the pontomedullary sulcus. Deeply located compression site can easily be missed with microscopic inspection alone. © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021","Endoscope assisted; Facial nerve; Hemifacial spasm; Pontomedullary sulcus; Root exit zone","Brain Stem; Endoscopes; Hemifacial Spasm; Humans; Microvascular Decompression Surgery; Retrospective Studies; Vertebral Artery; polytetrafluoroethylene; adult; anterior inferior cerebellar artery; Article; brain stem; compression; dissection; facial nerve; facial nerve paralysis; female; follow up; hearing impairment; hemifacial spasm; hoarseness; human; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; medulla oblongata; microsurgery; microvascular decompression; neuroendoscopy; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; pons; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; postoperative complication; prospective study; retrospective study; surgical technique; symptom; treatment outcome; videorecording; brain stem; diagnostic imaging; endoscope; vertebral artery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106543183"

The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders’ knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location’s crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Awareness space; Crime location choice; Crime pattern theory; Rational choice theory; Routine activity nodes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094980085"

The Wormhole attack is considered to be the most unsafe attack due to its unusual pattern of tunnel creation between two malevolent nodes. In it, one malevolent node attracts all the traffic towards the tunnel and forwards it to another malevolent node at the other end of the tunnel and replays them again in the network. Once the Wormhole tunnel is created it can launch different kind of other attacks such as routing attack, packet dropping, spoofing etc. In past few years a lot of research is done for securing routing protocols. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is considered foremost MANET routing protocols. In this paper we are forming the wormhole tunnel in which malevolent nodes use different interfaces for communication in DSR protocol. NS3 simulator is being used for the analysis of the DSR routing protocol under the wormhole attack. This paper provides better understanding of the wormhole attack in DSR protocol which can benefit further research. © 2020 IEEE.","DSR; MANET; NS3 Simulation; Wormhole Attack","Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Routing protocols; DSR protocol; Dynamic Source Routing Protocol; Exposed to; MANET routing protocols; Packet dropping; Routing attacks; Security attacks; Wormhole attack; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101059160"

With the enormous rise in cyber-attacks in today's world, it becomes imperative to monitor the network packet flow in order to identify attacks by intruders, which otherwise can lead to disruptions and losses in computing resources. These large dimensional and voluminous network packets have to be carefully examined and investigated for network anomalies, and will be a tedious and complicated task. Hence, to make this process simpler, a network anomaly detection model that considers the temporal variations in packet transmissions to identify the threats and to protect these networks against malicious activities is proposed. In this model, we propose a machine learning based anomaly detection system (ADS) that is capable of classifying malicious and benign traffic. At the same time, identifies the time varying patterns by using unsupervised learning that provides the patterns and hidden features in the captured packets. Kohonen's self-organizing map neural network (KSOM-NN) is used as an unsupervised learning method to classify the pre-processed packet features into clusters and thereafter the classification methods are used and verified with the labelled dataset. Similarly, a statistical analysis and a threshold value of packet loss, jitter, and other parameters for normal and anomalous packets are observed for further investigations. Above models were trained and tested with the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Totally the patterns are thoroughly analyzed for anomalies with the help of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Improved performance with respect to anomaly detection rate and accuracy is observed. © 2021 IEEE.","Computer Networks; Intrusion Detections; Machine Learning; Network Anomaly; Supervised Learning","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Conformal mapping; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Network security; Packet networks; Self organizing maps; Ubiquitous computing; Unsupervised learning; Anomaly detection; Computer networking; Intrusion-Detection; Machine-learning; Mobile-computing; Network anomalies; Network packets; Network usage; Supervised learning; Ubiquitous networks; Anomaly detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123375560"

The kernel intensity estimator describes the spatial distribution of gunfire and identifies chronic hotspots. The nonparametric test for comparison of first-order intensities found differences between gunfires with and without fatalities or police presence. The recently developed log-ratio based first-order separability test found that the spatial distribution of gunfire, fatalities and police presence varied over time. Finally, spatiotemporal inhomogeneous K-tests detected clustering between gunfire events, fatalities and police presence.

We used geocoded data of IPVAW cases with associated protection orders (n = 5867) in the city of Valencia, Spain (2011–2018). The city's 552 census block groups were used as the neighborhood units. Neighborhood-level covariates were: income, education, immigrant concentration, residential instability, alcohol outlet density, and criminality. We used a Bayesian autoregressive approach to spatio-temporal disease mapping. Neighborhoods with low levels of income and education and high levels of residential mobility and criminality had higher relative risk of IPVAW. Spatial patterns of high risk of IPVAW persisted over time during the eight-year period analyzed. Areas of stable low risk and with increasing or decreasing risk were also identified. Our findings link neighborhood disadvantage to the existence and persistence over time of spatial inequalities in IPVAW risk, showing that high risk of IPVAW can become chronic in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our analytic approach provides specific risk estimates at the small-area level that are informative for intervention purposes, and can be useful to assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts in reducing IPVAW. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling; Disease mapping, intimate partner violence, neighborhood influences, small-area study; Neighborhood disadvantage; Spatio-temporal epidemiology; Violence against women","Bayes Theorem; Cities; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Longitudinal Studies; Residence Characteristics; Spain; Vulnerable Populations; Article; controlled study; criminal behavior; education; feasibility study; female; geography; high risk population; human; immigrant; income; longitudinal study; low risk population; neighborhood; partner violence; retail outlet; risk factor; Southern European; Spain; Bayes theorem; city; demography; epidemiology; vulnerable population","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104445566"

In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%.

A major threat to the sustainability of this ecosystem is click fraud, i.e., ad clicks performed by malicious code or automatic bot problems. Existing click fraud detection approaches focus on analyzing the ad requests at the server side. However, such approaches may suffer from high false negatives since the detection can be easily circumvented, e.g., when the clicks are behind proxies or globally distributed. In this paper, we present AdSherlock, an efficient and deployable click fraud detection approach at the client side (inside the application) for mobile apps. AdSherlock splits the computation-intensive operations of click request identification into an offline procedure and an online procedure. In the offline procedure, AdSherlock generates both exact patterns and probabilistic patterns based on URL (Uniform Resource Locator) tokenization. These patterns are used in the online procedure for click request identification and further used for click fraud detection together with an ad request tree model. We implement a prototype of AdSherlock and evaluate its performance using real apps. The online detector is injected into the app executable archive through binary instrumentation. Results show that AdSherlock achieves higher click fraud detection accuracy compared with state of the art, with negligible runtime overhead.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","ad requests identification; Click fraud detection; mobile advertising","Ecosystems; Binary instrumentations; Computation intensives; Mobile advertising; Mobile applications; On-line procedures; Probabilistic patterns; Runtime overheads; State of the art; Crime","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102358175"

Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Discrete choice; Physical and social barriers; Residential burglary","China; Access control; Crime; Decision making; Housing; Location; Chinese cities; Conditional logit; Discrete choice; Local residents; Nonlocal; Physical barriers; Target location; crime; decision making; discrete choice analysis; location decision; spatial analysis; urban area; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097862626"

We argue that a neighborhood’s well-being depends not only on its own socioeconomic conditions but also on the conditions of neighborhoods its residents visit and are visited by, connections that form through networks of everyday urban mobility. We construct measures of mobility-based disadvantage using geocoded patterns of movement estimated from hundreds of millions of tweets sent by nearly 400,000 Twitter users over 18 months. Analyzing nearly 32,000 neighborhoods and 9,700 homicides in 37 of the largest U.S. cities, we show that neighborhood triple disadvantage independently predicts homicides, adjusting for traditional neighborhood correlates of violence, spatial proximity to disadvantage, prior homicides, and city fixed effects. Not only is triple disadvantage a stronger predictor than traditional measures, it accounts for a sizable portion of the association between residential neighborhood disadvantage and homicides. In turn, potential mechanisms such as neighborhood drug activity, interpersonal friction, and gun crime prevalence account for much of the association between triple disadvantage and homicides. These findings implicate structural mobility patterns as an important source of triple (dis)advantage for neighborhoods and have implications for a broad range of phenomena beyond crime, including community capacity, gentrification, transmission in a pandemic, and racial inequality. © American Sociological Association 2020.","crime; inequality; neighborhood effects; neighborhood networks; urban mobility; violence","United States; mobility; neighborhood; network analysis; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban transport; violence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097005224"

The results showed that the women faced multiple threats to their safety, including gender-based violence, harassment and crime, and traffic and non-traffic injuries, and that the use of paid transport was associated with high levels of anxiety and fear. Despite these circumstances, the women were captive travellers, forced to make transport choices based on price, availability and ease of travel rather than safety. Unable to choose safe transport, the women attempted to mitigate risks by changing their travel patterns and behaviour and by restricting their travel frequency.

Routine activity approach posits that crimes take place when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian intersect in space and time. Once presented with a crime opportunity, rational choice perspective suggests that an offender weighs the costs associated with engaging in crime against the potential benefits. Such ""rational"" decision-making is bounded by one's life circumstances and the available information.

The central protagonist of the game, Mario is tasked with making his way through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from her captor, Bowser, King of the Koopa. Along the way, Mario collects coins and various power-ups, and must avoid pitfalls and eliminate enemies. Mario is motivated to collect such targets by his need to survive and complete his mission. Many targets are difficult to reach due to environmental hazards and game enemies serving as guardians over the desired rewards.

This paper argues that to grasp fully the potentials of these innovations they must be understood both in the context of established patterns of police–minority relations and as part of significant changes in the use of ‘race’ as an object of knowledge in science, policy, and politics. Socio-technical developments offer new means of identification through geneticisation, datafication, and visualisation and heighten the visibility and valorisation of racial difference. Elements of this are already evident in existing national police forensic DNA databases whose operation, outcomes, and accompanying ethical frames are racialised in varied ways. By openly mobilising race and ethnicity, however, predictive techniques raise new questions about the validity, interpretation, dissemination, and application of results. Examination of existing use by the police and public of suspect descriptions shows the enduring power of common sense visual and linguistic understandings of race and appearance. That very power makes it hard to transition effectively from moments of collective stigmatisation to the identification of individual suspects. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","Ethnicity; Forensic genetics; Phenotype prediction; Race; Racism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058858484"

At its current rate, Boko Haram takes part in more than two events each day, taking the lives of nearly 11 people daily. Yet, little is known concerning Boko Haram’s internal structure, organisation, and its mobility. Here, we propose a novel technique to uncover the internal structure of Boko Haram based on the sequence of events in which the terrorist group takes part. Data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) gives the location and time of nearly 3,800 events in which Boko Haram has been involved since the organisation became violent 10 years ago. Using this dataset, we build an algorithm to detect the fragmentation of Boko Haram into multiple cells, assuming that travel costs and reduced familiarity with unknown locations limit the mobility of individual cells. Our results suggest that the terrorist group has a very high level of fragmentation and consists of at least 50–60 separate cells. Our methodology enables us to detect periods of time during which Boko Haram exhibits exceptionally high levels of fragmentation, and identify a number of key routes frequently travelled by separate cells of Boko Haram where military interventions could be concentrated. © 2020, The Author(s).","Boko Haram; Crime; Mobility; Terrorism","Cells; Cytology; Terrorism; Boko haram; Cameroon; Current rate; Internal structure; Mobility; Mobility pattern; Niger; Nigeria; Novel techniques; Terrorist groups; Location","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086510462"

Technologies have also been developed to store and manipulate these data to enhance decision making. Crime remains a severe threat to humanity. Criminals currently, exploit highly sophisticated technologies to perform criminal activities. To effectively combat crime, LEAs must be adequately equipped with technological tools such as data mining technology to enable useful discoveries from databases. To achieve this, a Real-time Integrated Crime Information System (RICIS) was developed and mobile phones were used by informants (general public) to capture information about crimes being committed within Southern-East, Nigeria. Each crime information captured is being sent to the LEA responsible for the crime type and the information is stored in the agency database for data analysis. Thus, this study uses data mining algorithms to analyze crime trends and patterns in Southern-Eastern part of Nigeria between 2012 and 2013. The algorithms adopted were Classification and Rule Induction. The data set of 973 were collected from Eleme Police station, PortHarcourt (2012) and Nsukka Police station (2013).

Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with crime prevention strategies, and exploring crime prediction techniques, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents a simulation model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. The simulation generates patterns of individual mobility aiming to cumulatively match crime patterns. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure, location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as a proxy for human activity, and taxi trip data as a proxy for human movement between regions of the city. We analyze and systematically compare 35 different mobility strategies and demonstrate the benefits of using large-scale human activity data to simulate offender mobility. The strategies combining taxi trip data or historic crime data with popular activity nodes perform best compared to other strategies, especially for robbery. Our approach provides a basis for building agent-based crime simulations that infer offender mobility in urban areas from real-world data. © 2020 AI Access Foundation.

It may also establish different patterns of the neighborhood infrastructure usage for different social groups, such as using specifically more secure streets and public spaces. The main goal of this paper is to define the routes and spaces where people walk and use in their neighborhoods in which they feel safe, and to understand how different social groups walk‐through and use the same urban environment. This is analyzed by the security rating index (SRI) model, a GIS‐based mapping model, which is used to identify and rate secure urban areas for better walkability.

Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories. © The Author(s) 2020.","crime pattern theory; criminological theory; edge; rational choice theory; small area; social disorganization","anomie; article; controlled study; crime; dependent variable; experimental design; firearm; human; logic; social status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089064043"

Even though several legal and technological steps are adopted worldwide, women's safety continues to be an international concern. Criminal records are maintained by law enforcement agencies and are most often not available to the public in an easily comprehensible form. While some wearable devices and mobile applications are available which are touted to aid in ensuring women's safety, they utilize limited societal intervention and are not very efficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. Most often the crime response, crime analysis, and crime prevention schemes are not integrated, leading to gaps in ensuring women's safety. Our major contribution is in developing a holistic system encompassing the three crucial aspects, i.e crime analysis and mapping, crime prevention, and emergency response by leveraging societal participation for women safety management. This work applies the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the identification of hotspots and patterns of crime. The proposed system uses data generated from the mobile application and/or wearable gadget prototyped as a part of this work along with the criminal history records for crime response, analysis, and prevention. The system for the hotspot identification is demonstrated for the Pilani town in the Jhunjhunu district in the state of Rajasthan, India, and can be easily scaled up geographically and utilized as a safety strategy for smart cities.

However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Addition; Bus stop; Cincinnati; Relocation; Removal; Street robbery","Cincinnati; Ohio; United States; Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Buses; Location; Relocation; Removal; Addition; Bus stop; Cincinnati; Difference-in-differences; Point of interest; Quasi-experiments; Socioeconomic characteristics; Spatial heterogeneity; assessment method; bus transport; crime; experimental study; location decision; relocation; spatial analysis; transportation infrastructure; transportation safety; Crime","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077320270"

Natural disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity as climate changes. For some people, the increase in risk from these disasters is a reason to move away from certain places or avoid others. Contemporary migration literature has largely ignored environmental factors for mobility, concentrating instead on economic and amenity or lifestyle factors. In this study we fill this gap by exploring the extent to which people in Australia consider natural hazards in their location choices and mobility decisions. Results from a survey using best-worst scaling showed that non-environmental factors prevail, with safety from crime the factor people consider most important when moving somewhere for a new job, followed by living costs and provision of adequate health care. Environmental factors were secondary in people's migration decisions but more important than attractive scenery and educational opportunities. The reasons people in Australia are not particularly dissuaded from moving to places where the prospects of good employment opportunities are high even though they risk the effects of natural disasters, might be a belief in their ability to cope with the disasters should they occur (self-efficacy).

This phenomenon, combined with the fact that people use mobile phones for a longer period of time, results in mobile phones becoming the main source of creation of visual information. However, its reliability as a true representation of reality cannot be taken for granted due to the constant increase in editing software. This makes it easier to alter original content without leaving a noticeable trace in the modification. Therefore, it is essential to introduce forensic analysis mechanisms to guarantee the authenticity or integrity of a certain digital video, particularly if it may be considered as evidence in legal proceedings. This paper explains the branch of multimedia forensic analysis that allows to determine the identification of the source of acquisition of a certain video by exploiting the unique traces left by the camera sensor of the mobile device in visual content. To do this, a technique that performs the identification of the source of acquisition of digital videos from mobile devices is presented. It involves 3 stages: (1) Extraction of the sensor fingerprint by applying the block-based technique. (2) Filtering the strong component of the PRNU signal to improve the quality of the sensor fingerprint. (3) Classification of digital videos in an open scenario, that is, where the forensic analyst does not need to have access to the device that recorded the video to find out the origin of the video. The main contribution of the proposed technique eliminates the details of the scene to improve the PRNU fingerprint. It should be noted that these techniques are applied to digital images and not to digital videos. In this work, we show that it is necessary to take this improvement into account to improve the identification of digital videos. Experimental results are also presented that support the validity of the techniques used and show promising results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Acquisition source identification; Forensics analysis; H.264; Key frame extraction; PRNU; Sensor pattern noise; Smartphone; Video enhancement; Video forensics analysis; Video source acquisition","4G mobile communication systems; 5G mobile communication systems; Cameras; Cellular telephones; Computer crime; Computer graphics; Digital devices; Electronic document exchange; Global system for mobile communications; Multimedia systems; Software reliability; Compression effects; Forensic analysis; Forensic analyst; Legal proceedings; Multimedia forensics; Source camera identifications; Visual content; Visual information; Digital forensics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099449282"

Inexplicable cases of violence are all too common in schools, families and public places. The article analyzes a small part of the theories of juvenile delinquency that exist in the global aspect, which are based on the understanding that criminal acts are determined by mental and behavioral processes at the individual level. According to the theory of rational choice, minors are motivated offenders who subordinate their behavior to a certain goal. Another group of views is defined as theories of biological and psychological traits. Antisocial manifestations are not so much due to the course of certain motivational processes in an individual's mental state, but primarily to the formation of individual patterns of behavior. The article aims to assist Bulgarian criminal law and criminology in clarifying the current circumstances in which juvenile delinquency develops, and the conclusion is that they do not differ significantly from those in the global context. The different perspectives on juvenile delinquency and the interdisciplinary nature of the problems are presented as objectively as possible. Such an approach can lead to a rethinking of the mechanisms and measures that should be applied to achieve the educational purpose of punishment. The analysis presented in the article also supports the introduction of alternative measures to punishment, as well as the achievement of better results in terms of resocialization of juvenile offenders. © St. Petersburg State University, 2021","Biological traits; Causes of crime; Juvenile offenders; Punishment; Rational choice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125698020"

Using eye tracking as a CTA methodology, this article explores visual search patterns in complex work environments and situations. It presents a simulated crime scene case study that applies eye tracking-based experiments in foraging and sense-making loops to elicit and represent knowledge on expert versus novice search patterns for complex work. The case probes the visual search task of preliminarily evaluating and documenting potential crime scene evidence. The experimental protocol relies on the ASL Mobile Eye and the analyses of experimental data include preliminary inspections of live-viewing data on eye-movements, precedence matrices detailing scan paths, and gaze charts that illustrate participants’ attention based on fixation counts and durations. In line with the CTA methodology, the article uses concept maps to represent knowledge derived from different phases of the study. The article also discusses the research implications and methodologically reflects on the case study. Practitioner summary: This study offers valuable insights for work design. The use of eye tracking as a CTA methodology offers potentials for translating visual search tasks into defined visual search concepts for complex work environments and situations. The ability to model visual attention is valuable for work designs that improve complex work performance, reduce work stress, and promote work satisfaction. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive task analysis; complex work; crime scenes; eye tracking; Visual search","Attention; Cognition; Crime; Eye Movements; Eye-Tracking Technology; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Professional Competence; Task Performance and Analysis; Visual Perception; Behavioral research; Crime; Employment; Ergonomics; Eye movements; Job analysis; Cognitive task analysis; Crime scene evidence; Experimental protocols; Search patterns; Visual Attention; Work environments; Work performance; Work satisfactions; adult; article; crime; eye tracking; female; gaze; human; human experiment; job performance; job satisfaction; job stress; language; male; physician; visual attention; work environment; attention; cognition; crime; eye movement; forensic science; physiology; procedures; professional competence; task performance; vision; Eye tracking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091885979"

Engaging an exploratory design (which combines case profiling, in-depth interviews [IDIs], and focus group discussions [FGDs]) and ‘actor-network’ theoretical approach, which affirms the significance of both human and nonhuman agencies in processes of irregular transnational mobility, this study assesses the interpositions of gender and migrants’ smuggling along the Nigerian–Libyan migratory corridor. Although organized crime is explored as a general notion, the emphasis in the study has been on specific gender roles of individual actors (between the point of migrants’ departure [Benin City, Nigeria] and the point of migrants’ processing [Agadez, Niger Republic]). Of what significance are gender categories (male and female) in the recruitment of ‘organizers’ and ‘subjects’ of migrants’ smuggling within these study locations? Though it has been assumed that the female gender has often been at the receiving end of most organized irregular mobilities along the Nigerian–Libyan corridor, findings from this study have shown that female network actors have been as active as their male network counterparts in processes of migrants’ smuggling. The outcomes of this study have been particularly useful in situating the interpositions of gender and smuggling of migrants along the Nigerian–Libyan corridor within an appropriate epistemological context. © 2020 Oriental Institute of Cultural and Social Research and SAGE Publications.","Gender; gender roles; Libya; Nigeria; smuggling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128756304"

Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Community-policing model; Crime; Decision trees; Destination management; Predictive policing model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098753715"

MANET is an infrastructure-less ad-hoc network. It is a collection of mobile nodes that are connected in an arbitrary and dynamic manner. ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is a type of Machine Learning scientific and statistical model that is used by computer systems in order to perform a task without involvement of explicit intrusion, rather than relying on interference and patterns instead. As there is node mobility that can impose different security issues, MANETs are found more susceptible in security provision. In order to resolve this security issue, some authentication and encryption techniques can be proposed for the first-line defensein order to mitigate the security risks. However, complete eradication of these types of risks is next to impossible. For theSecond line defense, the necessity of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential in this case. IDS can be referred as a method tool or resource that can help to detect access and warn for any activity of unapproved or unauthorized network activity. The current research has been done to prevent the network from the intruders. The number of attackers has been increased in the network because of more usage of technology and wireless network. Data is not allowed by the attackers to transmit successfully from source node to destination node. These intruders want to steal data and let to the unsuccessful transmission. In this research we are deploying 48 to 66 nodes in a defined communication area of 1000*1000 height and width. While starting the transmission source node and destination node is defined. After that while using IDS and AODV protocol route is created between destination and source node. If network decreases its performance will need to apply cuckoo search as an optimization algorithm. Cuckoo search algorithm extracts the properties and observe the energy been consumed by each node. Optimized properties provided as an input to the decision tree classifier with the help of this, system is being prepared according to their properties. If there will be a chance for existence of intruder in the network then it will be classified using decision tree algorithm. At the end QOS parameters energy consumption is performed using cuckoo search optimization algorithm. The detected intruder is prevented using decision tree and removed from the MANET network.  © 2021 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); CS (Cuckoo search); data mining attack; intrusion detection system IDS; MANET","Authentication; Computer crime; Cryptography; Decision trees; Energy utilization; Intrusion detection; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Network security; Neural networks; Optimization; Quality of service; Search engines; Artificial neural network; Cuckoo search; Cuckoo searches; Data mining attack; Destination nodes; Intrusion detection system intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; MANET's; Source nodes; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126958655"

However, due to the hallucinogenic effect of tryptamine derivatives, they have been abused illegally by more and more users. The wide distribution of designer tryptamines has become a serious social problem, because they can cause serious damage to health and their psychotropic effects can lead to criminal activity. Some of tryptamines are controlled as narcotics under the Administration of Non-Pharmaceutical Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in China, such as 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DMT and so on. However, if they become controlled, new compounds with similar structures will then spread throughout the drug market. For known new psychoactive substances, mass spectra are compared with reference standards to identify the detected compounds. Nevertheless, in the case of such dynamic growth in the number of new substances on the drug market, the novel compound is often not already added to the spectra library. Without a reference standard, the compound must be identified from a detailed study of its mass spectra. Due to the limited applicability of spectral libraries, knowledge on fragmentation patterns of particular groups of new psychoactive substances is necessary to predict the structures of novel compounds. In 2015-2019, a series of eleven tryptamines were identified as new psychoactive substances in China. In this work, a fast and simple approach for the screening and identification of tryptamines was proposed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS). Compounds were analyzed on Aglient DB-5 MS column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm) with an initial temperature of 140 ℃ for gradient increased temperature by GC-MS and Acquity UPLC CSHTM C18 column (10 cm×2.1 mm×1.7 μm) with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A)-acetonitrile (B) as mobile phase for gradient elution by UPLC-QTOF MS. The fragmentation behaviors especially the MS fragmentation rules were compared and summarized. According to the structure and the typical fragmentations, these compounds can be easily identified. This method is fast and accurate, and can be used for analysising different types of tryptamines. So this work will be helpful to assist forensic laboratories in identifying these kinds of compounds or other substances with similar structure in their case work. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Chinese Mass Spectrometry Society.

This crowdsourced information is often meaningful and recommended to users, e.g., reviews on Yelp or high marks on Dianping, which poses the threat of Sybil attacks. To address the problem of Sybil attacks, previous solutions mostly use indirect/direct graph model or clickstream model to detect fake accounts. However, they are either dependent on strong connections or solely preserved by servers of social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel predictable approach by exploiting users’ custom patterns to distinguish Sybil attackers from normal users for the application of recommendation in mobile social networks. First, we introduce the entropy of spatial-temporal features to profile the mobility traces of normal users, which is quite different from Sybil attackers. Second, we develop discriminative entropy-based features, i.e., users’ preference features, to measure the uncertainty of users’ behaviors. Third, we design a smart Sybil detection model based on a binary classification approach by combining our entropy-based features with traditional behavior-based features. Finally, we examine our model and carry out extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Dianping. Our results have demonstrated that the model can significantly improve the detection accuracy of Sybil attacks. ©2021 IEEE.","Entropy-based features; Mobile social networks; Sybil attacks","Computer crime; Entropy; Fake detection; Social networking (online); User profile; Clickstreams; Entropy-based; Entropy-based feature; Graph model; Mobile social networks; Mobility traces; Spatial-temporal features; Sybil attack; Uncertainty; User's preferences; Feature extraction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119359497"

The inequities found in the US public school system probably result in such a highly stratified society. Conditions found in many schools and classrooms are often a microcosm of the same conditions and factors present in the broader American society. Scholars and education reform activists often use the term school-to-prison pipeline to describe what they view as a widespread pattern in the United States of pushing students, especially those who are already at a disadvantage, out of school, and into the criminal justice system. This research explored whether mentorship in the lives of these very students can affect the trajectory that these students take in life by moving toward a pedagogy of liberation that challenges the inequities and contradictions in the institution of education. Building from a model similar to CDF Freedom Schools, but targeting academic enrichment, Farrah and her colleague Hope developed the Sankofa Project at Yin Elementary School (YES). Embracing both the social-emotional and pedagogical aspects of CDF Freedom Schools, the Sankofa Project moved from a mission that sought to instill a love for reading to actually teaching children to read. This aspect was pivotally important to Farrah and Hope as they sought to dismantle the “cradle to prison pipeline,” the concept of funneling masses of people into marginalized lives, imprisonment, and often premature death. Farrah believed that all her predecessors had done “was spot on, but academic enrichment was a key to steering children away from the pipeline.” With the rebirth of a caste-like system in America, black and brown bodies are disproportionately locked behind bars, relegated permanent second-class status if declared a felon and an increasingly common trend toward annihilation at the hands of those of who are designated to serve and protect them. © The Author(s) 2019.","community; ethnography; mentoring; Sankofa; sociology","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074613654"

The results indicate there was an overall drop in crime rates starting in April, especially in property crimes, which plummet to extremely unusual levels when compared with previous patterns. This pattern is most likely associated with an unprecedented decline in public mobility in some areas of the state. We show that the most significant reductions in street robberies occurred in neighborhoods where there was a greater decline in presence on the streets. Measures of police activity, in particular drug seizures and different types of arrests, dis-played a reduction comparable with the drop in criminal indicators. In contrast, the number of police killings followed a unique pattern: in April, immediately after the adoption of social distance measures, this indicator increased abo-ve the average from the previous four years; as of May, however, it assumed a downward trend, which turned into extraordinarily low levels in June. The extreme variation in the use of force by the police during the pandemic reinforces the documented dissonance between police lethality and criminal dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, shed-ding light on the mechanisms that regulate police violence in the state. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

Research into the use of telephone data to study criminal groups currently relies mainly on transcripts of phone conversations obtained through police wiretapping. Our exploratory research also benefited from privileged access to telephone data from wiretaps and records of call details collected both in real time and retrospectively during investigations. Our research focuses on the relation between the roles of individuals involved in drug trafficking and the spatial patterns detected in telephone communications. We asked whether the role of a protagonist - his/her function and place within a trafficking group - can be inferred from telephone activities and addressed this question through a spatiotemporal analysis of call detail records and wiretaps from 20 individuals implicated in drug trafficking. The selected individuals could be classified into three different roles : Dealer, mid-level or high-level wholesaler, and cross-border or national courier. To determine their mobility, median locations, convex-hull areas, and the average distance travelled per day were calculated for each individual and by role type. The results support the hypothesis that individual roles influence the patterns found in telephone data. Couriers can be differentiated from dealers and wholesalers based on identifiable geographic patterns. Dealers can also be distinguished from wholesalers. These results confirm the proposed approach and reveal the potential of the analysis of telephone data to infer roles in drug trafficking. © 2020 Presses de l'Universite de Montreal.

These videos can be shared across different platforms exposing them to any kind of intentional manipulation by criminals who are aware of the weaknesses of forensic techniques to accuse an innocent person or exonerate a guilty person in a judicial process. Commonly, manufacturers do not comply 100% with the specifications of the standards for the creation of videos. Also, videos shared on social networks, and instant messaging applications go through filtering and compression processes to reduce their size, facilitate their transfer, and optimize storage on their platforms. The omission of specifications and results of transformations carried out by the platforms embed a features pattern in the multimedia container of the videos. These patterns make it possible to distinguish the brand of the device that generated the video, social network, and instant messaging application that was used for the transfer. Research in recent years has focused on the analysis of AVI containers and tiny video datasets. This work presents a novel technique to detect possible attacks against MP4, MOV, and 3GP format videos that affect their integrity and authenticity. The method is based on the analysis of the structure of video containers generated by mobile devices and their behavior when shared through social networks, instant messaging applications, or manipulated by editing programs.

The object of this study is the automotive industry. However, the changing processes presented in this article affect many other industries. Digitalization will require not only new strategies from manufacturers trying to gain competitive advantages, but also a state that is responding to new reality to protect personal data and personal space of citizens.

After the marking is complete, the reference element runs all the options under the ""Cross Linking""menu. The authors base their research on consistent patterns characterizing the dependence of industrial development on the general economic situation. To analyze the processes occurring in industries under the influence of new technologies, a comparative analysis of the research materials of international research companies, world economic communities and advanced technological auto giants is carried out. The approaches used in the research include a prognostic analysis of the behavior of market entities under the influence of new digital technologies. Digital transformation is changing the traditional business model and value chain. The emerging trends are personalization of services and individual customer interaction solutions: Omnichannel pre-sales engagement, customized driving experience, targeted mobility, IoT integration, car dealerships, personalized insurance, personalized data insurance, car sharing customer profiles, etc. As the industry moves from the simple production of an automobile to the creation of an intelligent, connected digital transport hub, companies need to adapt to the value chain and life cycle of the client, not the car. Connected cars will be a continuation and expression of the individuality and style of the client, like the revolution of mobile phones. Digital transformation in the automotive industry will bring positive transformations for both consumers and society as a whole, affecting the environment at the same time and creating new jobs, which, of course, should attract attention and be supported by the state as a regulatory body. © 2021 ACM.","business strategies; Digital technology; economic models; innovative development","Automotive industry; Competition; Economic and social effects; Industrial research; Life cycle; Planning; Sales; Business models; Business strategy; Cross linking; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Economic models; Economic relations; Innovative development; Modern technologies; Value chains; Automotive industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125387649"

Nevertheless, the increasing availability of mobility data from cell phones to location-based services, has introduced a new family of mobility-based crime prediction models that exploit the relation between mobility patterns and reported crime incidents. One of the major concerns of using reported crime data is underreporting, which will bias the crime predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Hierarchical model that utilizes domain knowledge about biases in reported crime data to characterize and enhance fairness and accuracy in mobility-based crime predictions.

However, it is a well known problem of our cloud based mobile internet society and it must be solved by technocrats in the welfare of societal mental harassments. The main problem in executing credit/debit card fraud detection technique is the availability of limited amount of fraud related data like transaction amount, transaction date, transaction time, address, and vendor category code related to the frauds. It is the truth of mobile internet world that there are billions of potential places and e-commerce websites where a credit/debit card can be used by fraudulent people for online transactions and payments which make it exceedingly thorny to trace the pattern of frauds. Moreover, the problem of fraud detection in cloud— Internet of Things (IoT) based smart societies has numerous constraints like continuous change in the behavior of normal and fraudulent persons, the fraudulent people try to develop and use new method for executing frauds, and very little availability of frauds related bench mark data sets. In this research article, the authors have presented logistic regression based k-fold machine learning technique (MLT) for fraud detection and prevention in cloud-IoT based smart societal environment. The k-fold method creates multiple folds of bank transactions related data before implementing logistic regression and MLT. The logistic regression performs logic based regression analysis and the intelligent machine learning approach performs registration, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning, training, and reinforcement learning steps on the received bank transactions data. The implementation of proposed methodology and its further analysis using intelligent machine learning tools like ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, confusion matrix, mean-recall score value, and precision recall curves for European banks day-to-day transactions related bench mark data set reveal that the proposed methodology is efficient, accurate, and reliable for detecting frauds in cloud-IoT based smart societal environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Cloud-IoT based distributed environment; Confusion matrix; Fraud detection; Fraudulent; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Mean-recall-score; ROC curve","Crime; Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Internet of things; Logistic regression; Mobile commerce; Predictive analytics; Reinforcement learning; Bank transactions; Confusion matrices; E-commerce websites; Intelligent machine; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning techniques; Online transaction; Receiver operating characteristics; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101816961"

Now a days it’s very common to have patterns, pins and gestures-based security options. Since it is very common to have one these systems on devices, attackers are always developing new ways to bypass these security systems using attacks like smudge detection, shoulder surfing, gesture recognition and using a dictionary attack (brute force method) any pattern or PIN can be exposed with given time. In our proposed model through randomizing PIN number position on the phone screen and use of vibration as pin input we have sufficiently secured the user’s password from smudge attacks, shoulder surfing and gesture recognition also we have delayed the chance of being successful in a brute force attack as we have used vibration as a variable (and by limiting the attempt).

Unfavorable mobility ratio leading to viscous fingering, horizontal wells exhibiting 'the heel-toe effect' and fields with fracture-fault activities are more prone to these kinds of unwanted water breakthroughs, suffering from oil production losses and higher operational cost for management of the excessive produced water. A brown field in the south of the Sultanate of Oman was experiencing massive water short circuiting within two of its patterns. [MJO1]While conformance was well established and dynamically confirmed through production performance and artificial lift parameters in most patterns within the field, the complicated inverted nine spot injector-producer pattern scenario[MJO2] was making it difficult to ascertain the offending injectors or unexpected flow paths leading to the condition within the study area. The lower API oil and slightly fractured and faulted geology was exhibiting conditions for injection imbalance and the challenge was to bring the high water-cut wells back to full potential and increase oil output whilst reducing water flow. To investigate the breakthrough occurrences and mitigate the challenge, chemical water tracers were introduced in the reservoir as a part of Integrated Reservoir Management framework to identify flow directions and offending injectors. The Phase-1 of the two-phase study, discussed in this paper, was carried out to determine reservoir conformance that was contributing to short circuiting and once the cause was identified and treated, Phase-2 was carried out post well intervention to validate the success of the treatment. Phase-1 of the tracer study was initiated in October 2019 where two injectors and nineteen producers across two adjacent patterns were traced with two unique chemical water tracers. Massive tracer responses were obtained within the first few days in few wells, directly pointing out towards the offending injector(s). Sampling and analysis for Phase-1 was continued for about six months, after which, a zonal isolation was carried out in one the identified injectors in August 2020. Cement was pumped across all the perforation intervals and a new perforation was performed across the top and bottom of the reservoir avoiding the middle intervals that were taking about 70% of injection as per production logging. Phase-2 of the study was initiated in March 2021 and continued sampling and analyses are still being carried out. With about 15% reduction in water cut and a three-fold increase in oil rate at the target producer, the study validated that an integrated knowledge of reservoir geology and production behavior coupled with tracer studies was a very successful strategy for managing short circuiting in waterflood reservoirs. The study showed that this sequence and combination of methods can be useful in effective treatment for wells experiencing high water cut across the world. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Flow of water; Fracture; Horizontal wells; Injection (oil wells); Oil well logging; Reservoir management; Case-studies; Chemical water; Condition; Phase 1; Phase 2; Short circuiting; Tracer study; Water breakthrough; Water flood; Water tracers; Timing circuits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127651387"

The methodology combines use of a Geographical Information System (GIS), statistical analysis through negative binomial regression modelling and hypothesis testing. Results indicate that mobility and the level of victimisation are gender dependent. Women are at higher risk of victimisation than men in São Paulo’s central metro station, while men run higher risk of violence at end stations – both notably during late night periods. The presence of employees reduces the risk of violence, except during the mornings.

With the help of this device, all the data about a person can be tracked down (i.e. from the diet, diseases to contacts and transactions). In case of criminal investigations, inspectors need to collect information about a victim or accused. For this, the individual’s mobile phone plays a vital role. However, it is very difficult to access a device without its owner’s permission. Suppose, if the victim is dead or not willing to expose the information, the cyber police should perform many complex tasks to retrieve the data. Thus, there is a great need to analyze this task and make it feasible to find out pass-codes in order to access the mobile device. This paper explains how passwords can be cracked with ease with the help of survey and training of large dataset.

However, there is little guidance regarding their operations and initial observations demonstrate public disdain. This article deals with the evaluation of the public opinion in regard to e-scooters based on those who do not use them. To solicit input, an in-person and an electronic questionnaire were used in Thessaloniki, Greece. Statistical analysis of the collected data was undertaken to establish possible pattern of public opinion and identify situations of e-scooters that cause problems in pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic. Furthermore, the lack of infrastructure, which is a deterrent to e-scooter use, and the absence of a legislative framework that sets out the rules for traffic seem to be main concerns. Finally, the surveys noted that e-scooters will be promoted and integrated into traffic by designing and building adequate infrastructure, training users in Highway Code and imposing fines on offenders. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","E-Scooters; Micromobility; Urban mobility","Social aspects; Surveys; Electric scooters; Electronic questionnaire; Legislative frameworks; Micro-mobility; Public opinions; Public transport; Thessaloniki , Greece; Transport modes; Vehicles","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096410436"

Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets. Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crime pattern theory; Routine activities; Simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090488837"

The main challenge that emerges here is to secure the ecosystem created by the collaboration of 5G and IoT, which consists of a network, users, endpoints, devices, and data. Other than underlying and hereditary security issues, they bring many Zero-day vulnerabilities, which always pose a risk. This paper proposes a security solution using network slicing, where each slice serves customers with different problems. 5G and IoT are a combination of technology that will enhance the user experience and add many security issues to existing ones like DDoS, DoS. This paper aims to solve some of these problems by using network slicing and implementing an Intrusion Detection System to identify and isolate the compromised resources. This paper proposes a 5G-IoT architecture using network slicing. Research here is an advancement to our previous implementation, a Python-based software divided into five different modules. This paper's amplification includes induction of security using pattern matching intrusion detection methods and conducting tests in five different scenarios, with 1000 up to 5000 devices in different security modes. This enhancement in security helps differentiate and isolate attacks on IoT endpoints, base stations, and slices. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.","","Computer crime; Computer software; Ecosystems; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Network security; Pattern matching; Queueing networks; User experience; Conducting tests; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion Detection Systems; Iot architectures; Security issues; Security solutions; Simulation studies; Zero day vulnerabilities; 5G mobile communication systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101355572"

Criminological theories seeking to explain offender motivations are plentiful—some argue for a pure utilitarian agenda driven by opportunity (rational choice), others for the influence of socially constructed standards of behavior (strain, learning), and still others argue for accounting for multiple layers of influence (crime pattern theory). Though these theories have been used to explain the presence of antiquities looting, few have sought to examine offender motivations specifically due to a lack of data. But what kind of data should those interested in offender motivations be looking for? How does this align with possible underlying theoretical motivations? This study speaks to these questions by first considering how criminological theoretical paradigms account for antiquities looter motivations. Then, it traces how to approach examining looting motivation by identifying the types of evidence and data needed to test theoretical predictions and which methodologies would be appropriate for such an analysis. Finally, this study demonstrates this approach using case study featuring a newly collected spatiotemporal dataset on antiquities looting in Egypt. Looking from 2015 to 2017, this study will determine what can be learned about possible offender motivations in Egypt at this time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Antiquities looting; Criminological theory; Egypt; Methodology; Offender motivation","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167608518"

However, the emergence of click fraud greatly reduces the real benefits of the advertisement. Most existing researches focus on detecting click fraud by analyzing properties and patterns of click data streams, but attackers can construct data that looks legitimate by replaying former data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel system called ClickGuard to detect click fraud attacks. ClickGuard takes advantage of motion sensor signals from mobile devices, since the pattern of motion signals is completely different under real click events and fraud events. To prevent attackers from bypassing the system by faking the time-domain statistical characteristics of original signals, we introduce the MFCC algorithm in feature extraction phase. MFCC algorithm can extract frequency-domain features of original signals in specific frequency bands which are hardly constructed out of thin air. Classifiers are finally constructed using these features and several machine learning algorithms. Experiments show that ClickGuard can achieve the accuracy of 96.71% in general environment and 84.16% when attackers modify the time-domain statistical characteristics of raw data. © 2020 IEEE.","Click Fraud; MFCC; Motion Sensor Signals; Side-channel","Crime; Data streams; Frequency domain analysis; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Motion sensors; Time domain analysis; Frequency domains; Mobile applications; Mobile sensors; Original signal; Sensor signals; Side-channel analysis; Specific frequencies; Statistical characteristics; Side channel attack","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089411999"

However, some scholars believe the declining rate of American internal migration seems to have ‘slowed down’ obviously from 2007. This debate prompts us to quantitatively analyze the possible changes in migration patterns and the mechanisms of domestic population mobility. First, using empirical data of state-to-state migration, the paper quantifies American internal mobility and the evolution of migration patterns for the period from 2005–2015. Regional income disparities cannot explain the change in population migration patterns in the United States well. Then, the mobility barriers are estimated by an extended multilateral migration model that reveals a marked decrease in regional migration costs and an increase in individual rational choices, which are the critical factors in the structural changes in the migration pattern. Subsequently, we deconstruct the mobility barriers and indicate that in recent years, the human and natural environments had a great impact on population movement in the United States, such as the human development index, education grade, climate, cost of living index, house price index, and crime rate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Individual behavior; Internal migration; Mobility barrier; Multilateral migration model; Rationality","Physics; Cost-of-living index; Human development index; Individual behavior; Internal migration; Migration model; Migration patterns; Natural environments; Rationality; Population dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073186906"

WhatsApp is one of the most popular chat applications nowadays. WhatsApp offers different ways of communicating, which include sending text messages and making phone calls. The implementation of encryption makes WhatsApp more challenging for law enforcement agencies to identify when a suspect is sending or receiving messages via this chat application. Most research in literature focused on the analysis of WhatsApp data by obtaining information from a physical device, such as a seized mobile device. However, it is not always possible to extract the data needed from a mobile device for the analysis of the WhatsApp data because of the encryption, or no devices have been seized yet. In addition, the current techniques for real time analysis of WhatsApp messages show that there is a high risk of detection by the suspect. Alternative methods are needed to understand the communication patterns of a suspect and criminal organizations. In this paper, we focused on identifying when a suspect is receiving or sending WhatsApp messages using only wiretap data. Therefore, no seized devices are needed. The pattern analysis has been used to identify patterns of data sent to and received from the WhatsApp servers. The identified patterns were tested against a large dataset created with different mobile devices to determine if the patterns are consistent. By using the technique described in this paper, investigators will obtain more information if and with whom a suspect is communicating. © 2020 IEEE.","Packet pattern; WhatsApp communication analysis; WhatsApp forensics; Wiretap","Large dataset; Risk assessment; Telephone sets; Communication method; Communication pattern; Law-enforcement agencies; New approaches; Pattern analysis; Phone calls; Physical devices; Real time analysis; Cryptography","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101268252"

For each case, the main material barriers are identified, whether natural (rivers, hills) or artificial (roads, under/ over crossings) and some of intangible barriers (associated with road or crime safety). The maximum theoretical area (Euclidean) and that of the “actual” walkable neighbourhood are compared through network analysis (based on 20 minute journeys), considering the crossing conditions of main roads, quantifying the effects over time and distance, and accessibility to goods and services. In addition, the configuration of the road and pedestrian network is analysed, contrasting their local and global integration, based on axial maps. Finally, the movement patterns of the inhabitants is analysed based on the EOD data. The results showed a clear decrease of the actual walkable neighbourhood area (to one third of the Euclidian area) product of the urban grid and the various existing barriers, which reflects on the accessibility to goods and services by walking. These results allow us also to propose that although a greater average distance is not related to a greater walkable area, closeness to well served centralities associate to in with the prevalence of walking as a transport mode. © 2020 Universidad Diego Portales.

Few studies have examined issues of gender and the family in the history of Dalit, low-caste, and socially marginalized communities, especially those that were labelled 'criminal tribes' from the mid-nineteenth century on. This article explores the ways in which gender patterned criminalized communities' experiences of everyday colonial governance under Part I of the 1871 Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) in the first two decades that it was enforced in northern India. In this early period, the colonial government did not closely regulate marriage practices, domestic arrangements, or the gendered organization of labour within communities categorized as 'criminal tribes'. Nevertheless, notions of sexuality and gender underlay colonial knowledge of the 'criminal tribes', which emerged in dialogue with middle-class Indian gender and caste politics. Moreover, the family unit was the central target of the CTA surveillance and policing regime, which aimed to produce 'industrious' families. Officially endorsed forms of labour had complex implications for criminalized communities in the context of North Indian gender norms and strategies of social mobility. Gender power dynamics also shaped criminalized peoples' interpersonal, embodied interactions with British and Indian colonial officials on an everyday basis. Meanwhile, different forms of leverage and evasion were open to men and women to cope with their criminalization and so the colonial state was experienced in highly gendered ways. © Cambridge University Press 2020","","India; crime; elite politics; family structure; gender relations; gender role; nineteenth century; social history","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079170449"

So, VANET clustering techniques are needed with the consideration of the mobility parameters amongst nearby nodes to construct stable clustering techniques. At the same time, security is also a major design issue in VANET which can be resolved by the Intrusion Detection Systems. In contrast to the conventional IDS, VANET based IDS are required to be designed in such a way that the functioning of the system does not affect the real-time efficiency of the performance of VANET applications. With this motivation, this paper presents an efficient Fuzzy Logic based Clustering with optimal Fuzzy Support Vector Machine, called FLC-OFSVM based Intrusion Detection System for VANET. The proposed FLC-OFSVM model involves two stages of operations namely clustering and intrusion detection. Primarily, FLC technique is employed to select an appropriate set of cluster heads and construct clusters. Besides, a lightweight anomaly IDS model named FSVM optimized with krill herd optimization algorithm is developed to detect the existence of malevolent attacks in VANET. The KH algorithm which is based on the herding behavior of krillsis used to optimally tune the parameters of the FSVM model. In order to investigate the performance of the FLC-OFSVM model, an extensive set of simulations are carried out and the results are investigated in terms of several performance measures. © 2021, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Due to limited data protection of many popular online services in some countries such as taxi hailing or takeouts ordering, many users encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. This may aggravate the situation that criminals pretend to be delivery staff or taxi drivers, bringing threats to the society. Additionally, many people nowadays suffer from excessive digital marketing and fraud phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, and do not work for identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones which may show their Apps preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession related information. This offers us a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies or regulations (e.g. GDPR 71). Using appropriate statistical methods to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, provides a way to identify mobile phone callers without privacy concern. In this paper, we exploit privacy-preserving mobile data to develop a model which can automatically identify the callers who are divided into four categories of users: normal users (other professions), taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters. The validation results over an anonymized dataset of 1, 282 users with a period of 3 months in Shanghai City prove that the proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 75+%. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; Machine Learning; Mobile Big Data; Profession Prediction","Behavioral research; Crime; Privacy by design; Taxicabs; Web services; Binary classification; Mobile phone datum; Personal characteristics; Personal information; Privacy preserving; Private information; Sensitive informations; Spatial and temporal patterns; Cellular telephones","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104662799"

Through a politics and practice of ‘earwitnessing detention’, this article explores experiential patterns and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By ‘tuning in’ to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of ‘indefinite stuckness’. Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity for respite from the ‘chaos’ outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies indefinite stuckness. © The Author(s) 2019.","abjection; carceral continuum; confinement; earwitnessing; mobility; stuckness","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075183031"

Despite the progress made by recent deep learning-based human mobility learning models, some critical factors related to personal context and user-location interactions have not yet been fully explored. Besides, existing works suffer from high computational cost issues due to the increased complexity of trajectory learning and contextual location embedding. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end model called GNNTUL, composed of a graph neural network (GNN) module and a classifier, to effectively and efficiently learn human mobility and associate the traces to the users in online social networks. GNNTUL is the first GNN-based human mobility learning model exploiting implicit transition patterns behind sparse user traces in online social networks while extracting users' unique motion features and discriminating the motion traces. Extensive experiments conducted on two real- world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNNTUL over several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both linking accuracy and learning efficiency. © 2021 IEEE.","deep learning; graph neural network; mobility learning; spatio-temporal modeling; trajectory-user linking","Data mining; Deep learning; Location; Object detection; Social networking (online); Trajectories; Broad spectrum; Data mining tasks; Deep learning; Graph neural networks; Human mobility; Learning models; Mobility learning; Spatio-temporal data mining; Spatio-temporal models; Trajectory-user linking; Graph neural networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115688652"

Understanding where and when aggravated assaults are most likely to occur is therefore vital to minimize the victimization risk associated with this crime. The main aim of this study is to explore the relative importance of space and time in aggravated assault victimization. This was done using national level aggravated assault data (2008-2010) obtained from New Zealand Police and census data from Statistics New Zealand. Both the spatial and temporal distribution of aggravated assault are outlined to examine their association with aggravated assault victimization. Aggravated assault is found to cluster in space but not in time. The relationships between aggravated assault risk in space and time and a suite of social, economic, and lifestyle variables was then examined. A clear socioeconomic gradient was found between aggravated assault risk by space and all neighborhood characteristics with high-risk neighborhoods having greater residential mobility and ethnic/racial diversity, as well as being more deprived, having higher rates of unemployment, and lower median household incomes. No clear pattern emerged between aggravated assault by time and the selected neighborhood characteristics.

Methods: Longitudinal k-means clustering is used to unpick local area variation in police notifiable offences across England and Wales. We describe the clusters identified in terms of their spatial patterning, opportunity structures and crime type profile. Results: We find that in most small areas, crime remained fairly stable throughout the pandemic. Instead, a small number of meso-level areas contributed a disproportionately large amount to the macro-level trend. These were typically city centers with plentiful pre-pandemic crime opportunities, dominated by theft and shoplifting offences. Conclusion: Findings offer support for opportunity theories of crime and for a mobility theory of crime during the pandemic.

Methods: We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars’ target choice in a conditional logit model. Results: Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions: Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars’ target choices.

This paper proposes a novel method to discover abnormal behaviors and judge abnormal behavior patterns using mobility trajectory data. Abnormal behavior trajectory refers to the behavior trajectory whose temporal and spatial characteristics are different from normal behavior, and it is an important clue to discover dangerous behavior. Abnormal patterns are the behavior patterns summarized based on the regular characteristics of criminals’ activities, including wandering, scouting, random walk, and trailing. This paper examines the abnormal behavior patterns based on mobility trajectories. A Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)-based method is used to extract personal trajectory features, and the K-means clustering method is applied to extract abnormal trajectories from the trajectory dataset. Based on the characteristics of different abnormal behaviors, the spatio-temporal feature matching method is used to identify the abnormal patterns based on the filtered abnormal trajectories. Experimental results showed that the trajectory-based abnormal behavior discovery method can realize a rapid discovery of abnormal trajectories and effective judgment of abnormal behavior patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

MSM and transgender women also experience elevated rates of incarceration. Once community re-entry occurs, individuals are in a critical period for addressing potential risks of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition and negative sequelae of substance use. Further, the impact experienced by one's social and sexual networks experienced at the time of detention and release have important health implications for MSM and transgender women. Objective: The purpose of this study is to test a new intervention-Mobile-Enhanced Prevention Support (MEPS)-that involves a GPS-based mobile app called GeoPassport (referred to as GeoPass in practice), incentives, and peer support for promoting HIV prevention, substance use treatment, and use of related services. Methods: A two-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial will seek to enroll 300 HIV-negative MSM and transgender women, aged 18-49 years, with SUDs, who are either in jail or have recently left jail. Participants will be enrolled by study staff and randomized to the MEPS intervention group or usual care group. The intervention group will receive customized wellness goals in addition to GeoPass, cash incentives, and the support of a trained peer mentor for 6 months. Data collection will consist of a baseline survey and three follow-up surveys at 3, 6, and 9 months postenrollment, either in person or by phone or videoconference when necessary. The primary outcomes include establishing a primary care provider; being prescribed and adhering to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV; screening for HIV, STIs, and hepatitis C virus; and engagement in recommended treatment for SUDs. Secondary outcomes include obtaining treatment for any identified infections and avoiding recidivism. Results: Enrollment began in November 2019 and study completion is expected in 2023. Conclusions: This study will advance our knowledge base on patient navigation and peer mentor interventions. Peer navigation services have been studied for the treatment of HIV, but less often in the context of HIV and STI prevention among sexual and gender minority populations at the time of re-entry into the community from jail. The MEPS study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of combining peer mentor services with a mobile app to facilitate service utilization and participant-peer mentor communication. MEPS will assess patterns of PrEP uptake and utilization in MSM and transgender women leaving jail. The study will provide heretofore unavailable data from persons leaving jail regarding HIV PrEP, STI screening, substance abuse treatment, and service utilization patterns and experiences, including geocoded data for those in the intervention arm. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

The TireNet based on MobileNet V1 replace the single convolutional neural network of the original Siamese network. Finally, the low-level and high-level features are fused to generate a one-dimensional vector, and calculated the similarity by Euclidean distance. To verify the proposed method in this article, we construct a tire pattern dataset named TireDataset.

Recent studies suggest that the ambient population is a useful alternative measure of the population at risk that can better capture the activity patterns of a population. However, current studies are limited by the availability of high precision demographic characteristics, such as social activities and the origins of residents. In this research, we use spatially referenced mobile phone data to measure the size and activity patterns of various types of ambient population, and further investigate the link between urban larceny-theft and population with multiple demographic and activity characteristics. A series of crime attractors, generators, and detractors are also considered in the analysis to account for the spatial variation of crime opportunities. The major findings based on a negative binomial model are three-fold. (1) The size of the non-local population and people's social regularity calculated from mobile phone big data significantly correlate with the spatial variation of larceny-theft. (2) Crime attractors, generators, and detractors, measured by five types of Points of Interest (POIs), significantly depict the criminality of places and impact opportunities for crime. (3) Higher levels of nighttime light are associated with increased levels of larceny-theft. The results have practical implications for linking the ambient population to crime, and the insights are informative for several theories of crime and crime prevention efforts. © 2020 by the authors.","Ambient population; Crime; Larceny-theft; Mobile phone data; Spatial analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085653827"

At the same time, scammers, criminals, and fraudsters have also find the telephony network an attractive and affordable medium to target end-users with the advertisement, marketing of legal and illegal products, and bombard them with the huge volume of unwanted calls. These calls would not only trick call recipients into disclosing their private information such as credit card numbers, PIN code which can be used for financial fraud but also causes a lot of displeasure because of continuous ringing. The fraudsters, political campaigners can also use telephony systems to spread malicious information (hate political or religious messages) in real-time through audio or text messages, which have serious political and social consequences if malicious callers are not mitigated in a quick time. In this context, the identification of malicious callers would not only minimize telephony fraud but would also bring peace to the lives of individuals. One way to classifies users as a spammer or legitimate is to get feedback from the call recipients about their recent interactions with the caller, but these systems not only bring inconvenience to callees but also require changes in the system design. The call detail records extensively log the activities of users and can be used to categorize them as the spammer and non-spammer. In this paper, we utilize the information from the call detailed records and proposed a spam detection framework for the telephone network that identifies malicious callers by utilizing the social behavioral features of users within the network. To this extent, we first model the behavior of the users as the directed social graph and then analyze different features of the social graph i.e. the Relationship Network and Call patterns of users towards their peers. We then used these features along with the decision tree to classify callers into three classes i.e. human, spammer and call center. We analyzed the call record data-set consisting of more than 2 million users. We have conducted a detailed evaluation of our framework which demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving acceptable detection accuracy and extremely low false-positive rate. The performance results show that the spammers and call center numbers not only have a large number of non-repetitive calls but also have a large number of short duration calls. Similarly, on the other hand, the legitimate callers have a good number of repetitive calls and most of them interacted for a relatively long duration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Robocalls; Social network analysis; Telemarketers; Telephone call records; Telephone spam detection; User characterization","Audio systems; Crime; Decision trees; Directed graphs; Social networking (online); Telephone sets; Behavioral features; False positive rates; Relationship networks; Robocalls; Social consequences; Spam detection; Telemarketers; Telephone calls; Real time systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076256958"

The development of anti-spoofing strategies evolves at the same time as facial authentication technologies. Many methods for preventing such attacks have been proposed recently [1–3], showing excellent results accuracy in fraud detection. However, most of these methods are very efficient in detecting patterns—such as fraud—present a major disadvantage: a high computational cost. This cost directly impacts the user experience of the facial authentication system, since the spoofing verification adds an extra layer of inference by artificial intelligence models, causing a longer waiting time for the authentication system’s user. This impact is most noted when the inference is performed on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile, tablets, and edge devices. In this work, we carry out an experimental analysis of the common anti-spoofing strategies considering the trade-off between correctness fraud detection and computational cost, aimed at optimizing the user experience.

Such techniques include clock gating, power gating, dynamic voltage, and frequency scaling. Although such mechanisms help in minimizing dynamic power consumption by shutting off current to blocks or chip-operational units that are not in use, power gating and clock-gating techniques can be exploited by an attacker to disable blocks within the chipset targeting the subsystem availabilities. Attacks include disabling serial communication blocks, wireless/ethernet communication modules, Random Number Generator (RNG) block, interrupt module, etc. This paper proposed the development of a live clock-gating assisted malware attack for IoT systems based on the ARM Cortex-M processor.

This original new book explores how visual artists take part in regular cross-border mobilities, onward migrations and transnational communications across Europe for work and the effects of this on their feelings of home and belonging. It assesses how far there is a culture of mobility amongst visual artists from the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, for whom a combination of onward migration and regular cross-border mobilities is a necessity for career progression. This is due to the ‘glass ceiling’ in the Baltic States with regard to a lack of local art markets, few dealers buying art and governments not providing enough funding. How then do artists from the Baltic States get onto the global art market in the face of such barriers? This is a particularly important question, as these artists come from a region where migration, mobilities and cross-cultural exchanges were not freely available during the Soviet Union. This transdisciplinary investigation into visual artists’ working practices, ways of moving and placing dwellings addresses this issue. Mobile working practices have an impact on artists’ feelings of home and belonging, which can be seen in their artworks that compare different cultures. This is a result of their particular combination of onward migration and regular mobilities, the multiple flows in and out of the home cities and the workings of the global art market within which these artists are operating. Nevertheless, these movements are determined by the forces of the global art world, whereby a particular politics of migration and mobility is experienced by artists from the Baltic States wanting to ‘make it’ in the global art world. With its focus on Baltic artists and their mobilities, the scope and space explored is the whole of Europe and the mobilities explored in this text are crucially enabled by the freedom of movement in the European Union. The book is multidisciplinary and at the intersection of art, geographic mobility and creative practice. It combines visual cultures and social sciences in order to answer questions more thoroughly as well as to contextualise an analysis of artworks in a conversation with the artists themselves. This topic is current, with the situation of the ‘refugee crisis’ and Brexit that has created a culture of anti-immigration and resurgence in anti-Eastern European sentiment in government, mainstream media and society. The book discusses the implications of these complex itineraries on the conventional sociological notions of home, mobility and diaspora. The author argues that artists form a ‘diaspora of practice’ rather than of ethnicity, their homes are multiple as are the directions of their settlement. Primary appeal will be to artists and art professionals; scholars working and researching on mobilities and migration issues; those working on the concepts of belonging and home; sociologists; anthropologists; those in the fields of cultural studies and European Union studies. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.","Eastern europe; Immigration & emigration; Migration; The arts: general issues","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113986919"

The concept is useful to reconstruct how the territorial foundations of national state autonomy are partially reclaimed and, at the same time, partially purposefully suspended. The book focuses on the Prüm system, which facilitates the mandatory exchange of forensic DNA data amongst EU Member States. The Prüm system is an underexplored phenomenon, representing diverse instances of bio-bordering and providing a complex picture of the hidden (dis)integration of Europe.

A technology to store and maintain user's information that is mostly used for its simplicity and low-cost services is cloud computing (CC). Also, a new model of computing that is noteworthy today is mobile cloud computing (MCC) that is used to reduce the limitations of mobile devices by allowing them to offload certain computations to the remote cloud. The cloud environment may consist of critical or essential information of an organization; therefore, to prevent this environment from possible attacks a security solution is needed. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a solution to these security issues. An IDS is a hardware or software device that can examine all inside and outside network activities and recognize doubtful patterns that may demonstrate a network attack and automatically alert the network (or system) administrator. Because of the ability of an IDS to detect known/unknown (inside/outside) attacks, it is an excellent choice for securing cloud computing. Various methods are used in an intrusion detection system to recognize attacks more accurately. Unlike survey papers presented so far, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of intrusion detection systems that use computational intelligence (CI) methods in a (mobile) cloud environment. We firstly provide an overview of CC and MCC paradigms and service models, also reviewing security threats in these contexts. Previous literature is critically surveyed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of previous work. Then we define a taxonomy for IDS and classify CI-based techniques into single and hybrid methods. Finally, we highlight open issues and future directions for research on this topic. © 2020","Cloud computing; Computational intelligence; Intrusion detection system; Mobile cloud computing; Security","Computer crime; Intelligent computing; Intrusion detection; Network security; Surveys; Taxonomies; Cloud environments; Intrusion Detection Systems; Low-cost services; Network activities; Security issues; Security solutions; Security threats; Software device; Mobile cloud computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090918194"

Although information technology has provided substantial benefits mentioned above it, however, comes with disadvantages such as information security breaches and unsecure Information and Communication Technology environments. As a result, end-users are now connected to the Internet, and this has resulted in several internet users becoming victims of cybercriminals. This study aimed at evaluating patterns of cybercrimes associated with online transactions in the Namibian banking institutions' cyberspace and proposes mitigation strategies. To do that, the researcher interviewed six Namibian banking institutions to understand cybersecurity issues, trends and existing solutions. The study found that cybercrimes such as phishing, social engineering, vishing, smishing, spear phishing, spoofing and website compromise, distributed denial-of-service (DDos) are rampant. This is worsened by the fact that Namibia does not have a local cybersecurity framework to guide local banks in curbing these crimes.  © 2021 IEEE.","Banking sector; Cybercrime; Online transactions","Computers; Denial-of-service attack; Electronic commerce; Network security; Banking institutions; Banking sectors; Business processing; Credit cards; Cyber security; Cyber-crimes; Cyberspaces; Mobile bankings; Namibia; Online transaction; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126612019"

Furthermore, this research rarely assesses whether the psychological effects of specific stress exposures are genderspecific. The current study fills these gaps by ascertaining (a) gendered patterns of stress exposure among older African Americans, and (b) gendered nuances in the individual, collective, and cumulative effects of stress exposure on mental health. Using the National Survey of American of Life (N = 992; 614 women, 378 men), the study utilizes a sample of African American-identified women and men, 50 years of age and older. Study results revealed that gender patterns of stress exposure were dependent on the stress measure under investigation. In addition, women and men shared some stress predictors of mental health (e.g., everyday discrimination); nevertheless, other stress predictors were specific to women (e.g., health-related mobility challenges) while others were unique to men (e.g., perceived neighborhood crime). Study findings challenge gerontologists to engage how racial and gendered identities intersect to place race-gender groups at distinct risks for stressors that elicit poor mental health. Study results have implications for the development of tailored strategies for improving the psychological health of African American women and men in mid to late life. © 2022 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.","African americans; Differential exposure; Differential vulnerability; Mental health; National Survey of American Life; Older adults; Race/ethnicity; Social stress; Stress theory","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125363653"

Yet, they frequently face repression, including defamation, criminalization, and assassination. Recent policy and media coverage initiatives have provided much needed attention to the protection and support of defenders, but there has so far been little systematic analysis of patterns and determinants of repression at multiple scales. Here, we use databases providing the best available worldwide record of cases of socio-environmental conflicts and killings of defenders to identify patterns of repression and potential determinants of killings. Globally, about a third of socio-environmental conflicts involve mass mobilization, arrests and direct forms of violence. These ‘high intensity’ conflicts are more frequent in Asia and Latin America. At least 1734 killings of environmental and land defenders took place in a total of 53 countries between 2002 and 2018, most of them occurring in Brazil, the Philippines, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Peru. Our multivariate analysis indicates that major country-level determinants of killings include income level, foreign direct investment, dependency on mineral extraction, regime type, frequency of protest movements, and size of Indigenous populations. We suggest that more systematic reporting and analysis of repression – including through subnational level studies for which we provide testable hypotheses – can help protect and support defenders, notably through conflict-sensitive investment policies and greater accountability for abuses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental change; Environmental defenders; Environmental movements; Indigenous peoples; Natural resources; Repression","Brazil; Colombia; Honduras; Latin America; Mexico [North America]; Peru; Philippines; environmental change; equity; foreign direct investment; global change; indigenous population; investment incentive; land use change; mineral alteration; multivariate analysis; urban development; violence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092364262"

However, its use can also involve many risks. Examples include mobile devices, digital cameras and video surveillance cameras, which offer excellent performance and generate a large number of images and video. These files are generally shared on social platforms and are exposed to any manipulation, compromising their authenticity and integrity. In a legal process, a manipulated video can provide the necessary elements to accuse an innocent person of a crime or to exempt a guilty person from criminal acts. Therefore, it is essential to create robust forensic methods, which will strengthen the justice administration systems and thus make fair decisions. This paper presents a novel forensic technique to detect the post-processing of digital videos with MP4, MOV and 3GP formats. Concretely, detect the social platform and editing program used to execute possible manipulation attacks. The proposed method is focused on supervised machine learning techniques. To achieve our goal, we take advantage that the social platforms and editing programs, execute filtering and compression processes on the videos when they are shared or manipulated. The result of these transformations leaves a characteristic pattern in the videos that allow us to detect the social platform or editing program efficiently. Three phases are involved in the method: 1) Dataset preparation; 2) data features extraction; 3) Supervised model creation. To evaluate the scalability of the technique in real scenarios, we used a robust, heterogeneous and far superior dataset than that used in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Editing programs detection; Machine learning processing; Multimedia container structure; Social networks detection; Video forensics; Video post-processing detection","Computer graphics; Digital devices; E-learning; Forensic engineering; Learning systems; Multimedia systems; Security systems; Supervised learning; Video signal processing; Administration system; Compression process; Forensic Techniques; Model creation; Post processing; Quality of life; Supervised machine learning; Video surveillance cameras; Digital forensics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084175438"

These information can be theft by adversaries through suspicious apps installed in smartphones, and protecting users’ privacy has become a great challenge. So developing a method to identify if there are apps thieving users’ personal information in smartphones is important and necessary. Through the analysis of apps’ network traffic data, we observe that general apps generate regular network flows with the users’ normal operations. But information theft apps’ network flows have no relationship with users’ operations. In this paper we propose a model MUI-defender (Mobile Users’ Information defender), which is based on analyzing the relationship between users’ operation patterns and network flows with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), can efficiently detect information theft. Because of C&C (Command-and-Control) server invalidation [33] and system version incompatibility [25], etc., most of the collected information theft apps can’t run properly in reality. So we extract information theft code modules from some of these apps, and then recode and compile them into the ITM-capsule (Information Theft Modules capsule) for verification. Finally, we run the ITM-capsule and several normal apps to detect the network flows, which shows our detection model can achieve an accuracy higher than 94%. Therefore, MUI-defender is suitable for detecting the network flows of information theft. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","CNN; Information theft; Network flow; Operation pattern","Command and control systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Neural networks; Smartphones; Command and control; Convolutional neural network; Extract informations; Information thefts; Network flows; Operation patterns; Personal information; Privacy information; Crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062265649"

A signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) relies on predefined signatures to detect an attack. The signatures used are usually released periodically by the company who owns the IDS software or by the admin. Writing these signatures manually or waiting on the releases of new rules can take up significant time, effort, and knowledge.

A deficit to accurately process social cues, which has been widely documented in psychopathic populations, is assumed to underlie their pathological development. Impaired attention to socially salient cues, such as the eyes of an interaction partner, is a possible mechanism compromising the development of social cognition. Preliminary evidence from static facial stimuli suggests that psychopathy is indeed linked to reduced eye gaze. However, no study to date has investigated whether these mechanisms apply to naturalistic interactions. This study is the first to examine patterns of visual attention during live social interactions and their association with symptom clusters of psychopathy. Eye contact was assessed in a sample of incarcerated offenders (N = 30) during semistructured face-to-face interactions with a mobile eye-tracking headset and analyzed using a novel automated areas of interest (e.g., eye region) labeling technique. The interactions included an exchange on neutral predetermined topics and included a condition in which the participants were active (talking) and passive (listening). The data reveal that across both listening and talking conditions higher affective psychopathy is a significant predictor of reduced eye contact (listening: r = −.39; talking: r = −.43). The present findings are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy. This study is the first to document these deficits in naturalistic, live social interaction and therefore provides important evidence for their relevance to real-life behavior.

According to this research, interstate and inter-regional imbalances and disparities are the “birthmark” of world history. Disparities of development create tensions between and among countries resultant of conflicts between national governments. Comparing the concepts of “challenge-and-response” by A.J. Toynbee and “economic superiority” (“economic primacy”) by C. Kindleberger, the author suggests the idea of “avant-garde society”, i.e. society programming the basic parameters of modernization of the “catching up” peoples. “Later take-off” societies – Germany, Japan and Italy, to name just a few, – mobilized domestic resources like savings ratios, literacy, indigenous technologies, social capital and even ideology to compete on equal footing with pioneers of industrialization. The “later take-off” societies, Germany in particular, proved so efficient to join the league of the most advanced nations. The net economic impact of state intervention was vivid where markets were well-developed. State-centered mode of the “guided capitalism” was instrumental of upgrading Germany to the rank of the leading economic power, second only to the United States of America. Nowadays, with the collapse of the Soviet-American bipolarity and the subsequent disintegration of Pax Americana, the geopolitical structure of the modern world is becoming more composite, whilst the desire to attain the “avant-garde society” status forms a complex polymorphic architecture of a constantly changing oecumen/human space. In the new, tightening world, the external challenge factor is of central importance. Economy and geopolitics, therefore, predetermine a country’s ability to move to the position of the “avant-garde society”. In this constant motion, within the world political hierarchy, a prominent role belongs to the factors of physical geography, more specifically: to the peculiarities of interaction between the nature and society, which often require the people to act in a “challenge-and-response” pattern. © 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Knowing this both in real time and from historical records would allow effective law enforcement and crime prevention. However, very little research has been devoted into identifying pickpocketing gangs in an automated and holistic manner. This research utilizes smart card data generated by bus riders to identify pickpocketing gangs, who possess distinct characteristics from regular passengers. Particularly, we create a dataset of 1,098 pickpockets among 4.06 million bus riders in August, 2015 in Beijing automatically and efficiently based on an efficient labeling model of outliers. This model examines anomaly of passengers using the so-called relative outlier cluster factor and local outlier factor. The proposed mobility patterns of pickpockets are then learned based on supervised classification. Pickpockets from the derived dataset form a pickpocketing network, which is modeled as a graph with vertices denoted as discrete pickpockets, and edge weight quantified by a combined similarity on mobility pattern, space and time. A graphbased Louvain algorithm is adopted to detect pickpocketing gangs. Experiments are conducted on SINA microblog data to verify the detected pickpocketing gangs identified by the proposed framework. Results show that the framework detects 63 pickpocketing gangs and verifies 34 gangs by microblogs, with recall value 0.85. Findings from this research can assist police and public safety departments in the city in taking pro-active actions to track down pickpocketing gangs. © 2009-2012 IEEE.","","Law enforcement; Smart cards; Statistics; Crime Prevention; Historical records; Holistic manner; Local Outlier Factor; Mobility pattern; Public security; Space and time; Supervised classification; Buses","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068119566"

Design: Empirical research - qualitative. Method: Classic grounded theory with face-to-face interviews, 2017–2018, using inductive approach to understand public health nurses' intervening experiences with obesity patients. Results: To initiate the conversation emerged as the main concern meaning having difficulties initiating conversations about obesity with patients. Public health nurses’ facilitators to communicate lifestyle changes emerged as the pattern generating the theory, which consists of the categories; person-centeredness in the situation, experience and knowledge, strengthening conditions, access to other professionals and prioritization in everyday work. Conclusions: Public health nurses hesitate to raise topics of obesity in patients with mobility disability. They advocate increased integration with lifestyle changes in everyday work including multi-professional cooperation. The implication is testing the emerged theory at primary health care centres. Impact: Obesity is more common in people with mobility disability than in those without. There is a need to understand how public health nurses adapt counselling in lifestyle habits. Public health nurses hesitate to talk about obesity with patients in fear of offending anyone. Public health nurses did not distinguish between patients with or without mobility disability. Several facilitators could be helpful initiating conversation with the patients. Public health nurses need more time and resources to facilitate conversation with patients with mobility disability to counsel lifestyle changes. © 2019 The Authors.

The mobile device market is always growing and it is very competitive. Counterfeit and substandard devices are collectively known as black market devices. Availability of black market and stolen mobile devices is a global issue. When buying a mobile device, most of the people focus on cost, brand and model. The important factors that represent the standard of mobile devices such as validity of International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value are neglected. It is important to adhere to a proper policy framework and introduce systems such as Equipment Identity Registers (EIRs) to minimize the usage of black market and stolen mobile communication devices. Mobile device blocking and regulation have become difficult tasks due to the unavailability of proper systems and policies. This has allowed stolen and black market mobile device usage. As per the user survey conclusions, it was identified that user behavior patterns, limitations of existing EIR and prevailing policies should be changed to address the issue. A policy framework that includes the steps of increasing user awareness, establishing a proper blocking mechanism and adding reforms to regulations is recommended as a solution. © 2019 IEEE.","Counterfeit; Equipment Identity Register; International Mobile Equipment Identity; Mobile Communication Devices; Substandard","Behavioral research; Commerce; Crime; Engineering research; Marketing; Blocking mechanisms; Counterfeit; Mobile communication devices; Mobile equipments; Specific absorption rate; Substandard; Telecommunication sector; User behavior patterns; Mobile telecommunication systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072772784"

The economic disparity between the two countries caused differences in available employment opportunities. Limited employment opportunities in Indonesia cause an increase in unemployment in Indonesia. The high unemployment rate in West Kalimantan is the main cause of the migration of Indonesians to Malaysia with the aim of carrying out economic and trade activities in the Serikin Market which is located in Sarawak, East Malaysia. The market only takes about 15 minutes from the Jagoi Babang. This study used primary data collected by using in-depth interview and observation techniques which was analyzed qualitatively. The study found that in general the migration patterns of Indonesian traders who traded in the Serikin Market practiced non-permanent mobility patterns. The opportunities of cross-border trade carried out by Indonesian traders are reducing unemployment, facilitating product marketing, increasing income. While the challenges faced are the inadequacy of the road infrastructure, the quality of merchandise that is not good, the unavailability of lodging for Indonesian traders in the border area of Jagoi Babang, shop rental prices are relatively expensive. Basically, this research is to provide empirical data regarding to opportunities and challenges of cross-border traders that will be able to be used for future research related to strategies in managing cross-border trade Hopefully, this research will contribute significantly to generate an effective migration policy in order to minimize transnational crimes. © 2020 AJHTL.","Challenges; Cross border migration; Indonesia; Opportunities; Trader","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083795351"

The chapter begins by examining how these approaches have been applied. Subsequently, the reasons why the environmental approach can offer much more in this area if some apparent obstacles are overcome are presented. Finally, a method of applying these midrange theoretical frameworks to different cybercrimes is proposed. Relying on multiple empirical studies, it is stated that the essential premise of the environmental approach is also observed in cybercrime: the existence of situational patterns. These patterns are derived from the different ways in which offenders and targets, in the absence of guardians, converge in cyber places: digital interaction environments that shape the situational opportunities in which people interact. The chapter ends by summarizing the application possibilities of approaches such as the Crime Pattern Theory and Situational Crime Prevention in connection with the Routine Activity Theory and the Rational Choice Theory. It is proposed that many of the geographical applications derived from these approaches and some of their basic theoretical premises need to be adapted while seeking to enhance their strengths and mitigate the effects of their weaknesses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Crime event; Crime patterns; Crime science; Criminological theory; Cyber place; Environmental criminology; Geographical gap; Opportunity; Prevention","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089638024"

A probability sample of 816 respondents in China was used in collecting data regarding the beliefs of their own and other's vulnerability to fraud online. Key findings show that their negative perceptions of mobile Internet fraud vary significantly by the strength of their social relationships and network homogeneity—the closer the ties, the greater perceived vulnerability to mobile Internet fraud; the more homogenous their social networks, the more pronounced the pattern. In addition, awareness of the fraud was found to enhance the self-other perceptual gap. Finally, the perceived negative impact of the fraud on self leads to protective actions in terms of verifying suspicious messages. On the other hand, the negatively perceived impact on weak ties is related to staying alert and reducing the use of mobile Internet, suggesting that respondents viewed fraud victims in their social network as warnings. © 2019","Internet fraud; Mobile Internet; Protective action; Social networks; Third-person effects","Crime; Network security; Behavioral effects; Internet fraud; Mobile Internet; Network homogeneity; Online media; Protective action; Social relationships; Third-person effects; Social networking (online)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065788704"

Representing the system as a complex network, in which nodes are assigned to regions (e.g., a city) and links indicate the flow of people between two of them, physics-inspired models have been proposed to quantify the number of people migrating from one city to the other. Despite the advances made by these models, our ability to predict the number of commuters and reconstruct mobility networks remains limited. Here, we propose an alternative approach using machine learning and 22 urban indicators to predict the flow of people and reconstruct the intercity commuters network. Our results reveal that predictions based on machine learning algorithms and urban indicators can reconstruct the commuters network with 90.4% of accuracy and describe 77.6% of the variance observed in the flow of people between cities. We also identify essential features to recover the network structure and the urban indicators mostly related to commuting patterns. As previously reported, distance plays a significant role in commuting, but other indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate, are also driven-forces for people to commute. We believe that our results shed new lights on the modeling of migration and reinforce the role of urban indicators on commuting patterns. Also, because link-prediction and network reconstruction are still open challenges in network science, our results have implications in other areas, like economics, social sciences, and biology, where node attributes can give us information about the existence of links connecting entities in the network. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Cities; Human Migration; Humans; Machine Learning; Transportation; algorithm; city; human; machine learning; migration; traffic and transport","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070753563"

The method employs tcpdump packets and extracts multiple features from the packet headers. The tcpdump packets are transferred into documents based on the features. A topic model is trained using only attack-free traffic in order to learn the behavior patterns of normal traffic. Then, the test traffic is analyzed against the learned behavior patterns to measure the extent to which the test traffic resembles the normal traffic. A threshold is defined in the training phase as the minimum likelihood of a host. In the test phase, when a host's test traffic has a likelihood lower than the host's threshold, the traffic is labeled as an intrusion. The intrusion detection system is validated using DARPA 1999 dataset. Experiment shows that our method is suitable to protect the security of MEC.  © 2020 Xuefei Cao et al.","","Computer crime; Edge computing; Statistics; Behavior patterns; Intrusion Detection Systems; Latent dirichlet allocations; Multiple features; Network intrusion detection systems; Packet header; Topic Modeling; Training phase; Intrusion detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092003421"

We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending. © 2019","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077925570"

Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geographical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns. Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013. Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern. Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences.

The community researchers have designed many methods to automatically and accurately identify Android malware samples. However, the rapid increase of Android malicious samples outpowers the capabilities of traditional Android malware detectors and classifiers with respect to the cyber security risk management needs. It is important to identify the small proportion of Android malicious samples that may produce high cyber-security or privacy impact. In this paper, we propose a light-weight solution to automatically identify the Android malicious samples with high security and privacy impact. We manually check a number of Android malware families and corresponding security incidents and define two impact metrics for Android malicious samples. Our investigation results in a new Android malware dataset with impact ground truth (low impact or high impact). This new dataset is employed to empirically investigate the intrinsic characteristics of low-impact as well as high-impact malicious samples. To characterize and capture Android malicious samples' pattern, reverse engineering is performed to extract semantic features to represent malicious samples. The leveraged features are parsed from both the AndroidManifest.xml files as well as the disassembled binary classes.dex codes. Then, the extracted features are embedded into numerical vectors. Furthermore, we train highly accurate support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers to categorize the candidate Android malicious samples into low impact or high impact. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of our designed light-weight solution. This method can be further utilized for identifying those high-impact Android malicious samples in the wild. © 2013 IEEE.","Android malware; deep neural network; high impact malicious samples; low impact malicious samples; static analysis; SVM","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Deep neural networks; Machine learning; Malware; Reverse engineering; Risk management; Semantics; Static analysis; Support vector machines; Android malware; High impact; Highly accurate; Intrinsic characteristics; Low impacts; Neural network classifier; Security incident; Semantic features; Mobile security","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067170602"

This means that the corruption patterns (and thus protection guarantees) are based on the adversary being limited by what can be captured by a General Adversary Structure (GAS). We consider efficient secure multiparty computation (MPC) under such dynamically-changing GAS settings. In such settings, one desires to protect against and during corruption profile changes; such adaptivity also renders some (secret sharing-based) encoding schemes underlying MPC protocols more efficient than others when operating with the (currently) considered GAS. One of our contributions is a set of new protocols to efficiently and securely convert back and forth between different MPC schemes for GAS; this process is often called share conversion. We consider two MPC schemes, one based on additive secret sharing and the other based on Monotone Span Programs (MSP). The ability to convert between the secret sharing representations of these MPC schemes enables us to construct the first communication-efficient structure-adaptive proactive MPC protocol for dynamic GAS settings. By structure-adaptive, we mean that the choice of the MPC protocol to execute in future rounds after the GAS is changed (as specified by an administrative entity) is chosen to ensure communication-efficiency (the typical bottleneck in MPC). Furthermore, since such secure “collaborative” computing may be long-lived, we consider the mobile adversary setting, often called the proactive security setting. As our second contribution, we construct communication-efficient MPC protocols that can adapt to the proactive security setting. Proactive security assumes that at each (well defined) period of time the adversary corrupts different parties and may visit the entire system overtime and corrupt all parties, provided that in each period it controls groups obeying the GAS constraints. In our protocol, the shares can be refreshed, meaning that parties receive new shares reconstructing the same secret, and some parties who lost their shares because of the reboot/reset can recover their shares. As our third contribution, we consider another aspect of global long-term computations, namely, that of the dynamic groups. Settings with dynamic groups and GAS were not dealt with in existing literature on (proactive) MPC. In dynamic group settings, parties can be added and eliminated from the computation, under different GAS restrictions. We extend our protocols to this additional dynamic group settings defined by different GAS (see the full version of the paper [18] for formal details of protocols and proofs). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Dynamic general adversary structures; Monotone span programs; Proactive security; Secret sharing; Secure multiparty computation; Share conversion","Chromium compounds; Crime; Cryptography; Distributed database systems; Gases; Communication efficiency; Distributed systems; Monotone span programs; Organizational characteristics; Proactive security; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Threshold constraints; Network security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091167218"

Accompanied by this are modified requirements, such as interconnectivity, and new application scenarios, such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) or Machine-to-Service (M2S) communication. A major driving force in this development is the growth of interconnected devices towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, it is precisely the key enablers, such as mobility and flexibility, with the use of wireless communication solutions, that creates risks, attack vectors and cyber security threats. Depending on the open nature and the broadcast characteristic of the transmission type, it suffers a huge potential for miscellaneous cyberattacks. That is exactly why there is a great demand for the design of new communication systems for industrial applications that includes secure communication with doubtlessly authenticated entities. All other security services, such as confidentiality, integrity and reliability, are based on tamper-proof identification of all participating entities. Since conventional cryptography often comes along with a lot of overhead in form of complex computations as well as overhead in communication, both of which is not always suitable for small embedded devices and CPS applications, more lightweight security measures need to be introduced. In this work we suggest an approach based on the combination of different Physical Layer Security (PhySec) methods. PhySec comprises a series of technical procedures in which the generation of cryptographic credentials is based on different physical properties. We use the conditions and characteristics of the wireless channel to apply Secret Key Generation (SKG) methods. This enables key generation and key exchange in a one-step process. Furthermore, we utilize minimal deviations in the manufacturing process of semiconductors, such as impurities during the doping and different oxide layer thicknesses, to gain a chip individual bit pattern of SRAM-cells, so-called Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). These patterns, unique to each component, allow the use of cryptographic applications without the need to integrate external cryptographic material into the device. They are an inherently given and furthermore hard to forge opportunity to use security mechanisms. Our approach is a low cost, resource-saving and efficient alternative to conventional used cryptographic methods. It is a feasible way to enable confidence in IIoT systems. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

J. T. Mitchell’s (2012) insights on ‘race as a medium’ and a ‘framework of seeing through or seeing as,’ this essay argues that debates on Sudanese ‘criminal gangs’ in Melbourne, Australia; policies to counter alleged ‘radicalisation’ among Muslim youth in the UK; the continuing struggles for indigenous land rights; and rejections of asylum seekers almost everywhere in the West, attest to the operations of technologies of bureaucracy which, in turn, mobilise racially prejudiced systems of classification and patterns of misrecognition. Understanding the present conjuncture or the current crisis is integral to any politics opposing such classificatory systems and prejudicial ideologies. As Stuart Hall has reminded us, this involves taking into account ‘“relatively autonomous” sites—which have different origins, are driven by different contradictions, and develop according to their own temporalities’ which ‘are nevertheless “convened” or condensed in the same moment’ (Hall and Massey in Soundings 44: 38). Arguments over what constitutes the ‘real’ in these instances are not so much about ‘fake news’ as the ways in which images go ‘before’ the black immigrant, the Muslim youth, the asylum seeker, or the indigenous community in the form of abiding stereotypes that shape newer systems of misrecognition and misrepresentation. However, analysing the present conjuncture and the current crisis, of which such forms of misrecognition are emblematic, involves examining not just the ‘dominant’ or hegemonic but also, as Raymond Williams recommended (and John Clarke [2014] recently reiterated), considering the multiple temporalities and formations that together constitute the ‘emergent’ and the ‘residual.’ Using Policing the Crisis as a model, this essay draws on the recent work of W. J. T. Mitchell, Saskia Sassen, Patrick Wolfe, Arjun Appadurai and David Roediger to examine digital mediations/interventions by indigenous and refugee communities, recent protest movements, and the entanglements of race and class to argue that indigenous and refugee communities, along with the global poor, comprise the global subaltern. While the reasons for their current precarity and the various aspects that comprise their subaltern conditions may differ between these groups, the politics of ‘race,’ ethnicity and exclusion, and of representation and ‘voice,’ appear to impinge on both their material and their digital presence in similar ways. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter ‘mobility’) among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD. Methods Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group. Results In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05). Conclusions Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES. © 2019 Hayashi et al.

However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crime control; crime prevention; criminological theory; Private policing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042235930"

The mobile advertising frauds caused by fraudulent clicks or other actions on advertisements are considered one of the most critical issues in mobile advertising systems. To combat the evolving mobile advertising frauds, machine learning methods have been successfully applied to identify advertising frauds in tabular data, distinguishing suspicious advertising fraud operation from normal one. However, such approaches may suffer from labor-intensive feature engineering and robustness of the detection algorithms, since the online advertising big data and complex fraudulent advertising actions generated by malicious codes, botnets, and click-firms are constantly changing. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted heterogeneous graph embedding and deep learning-based fraud detection approach, namely, GFD, to identify fraudulent apps for mobile advertising. In the proposed GFD approach, (i) we construct a weighted heterogeneous graph to represent behavior patterns between users, mobile apps, and mobile ads and design a weighted metapath to vector algorithm to learn node representations (graph-based features) from the graph; (ii) we use a time window based statistical analysis method to extract intrinsic features (attribute-based features) from the tabular sample data; (iii) we propose a hybrid neural network to fuse graph-based features and attribute-based features for classifying the fraudulent apps from normal apps. The GFD approach was applied on a large real-world mobile advertising dataset, and experiment results demonstrate that the approach significantly outperforms well-known learning methods.  © 2020 Jinlong Hu et al.","","Crime; Deep learning; Embeddings; Graph algorithms; Graphic methods; Large dataset; Learning systems; Advertising frauds; Detection algorithm; Feature engineerings; Graph-based features; Heterogeneous graph; Hybrid neural networks; Machine learning methods; Statistical analysis methods; Marketing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092008983"

Android operating system provides the subsequent category of security screen lock mechanism options namely pattern lock, PIN lock, password lock, etc. Pattern lock is a prevalent method to secure Android mobile phone as they are a considerable measure less demanding to recollect than PIN codes or passwords. Actually, around 40% of Android mobile phone proprietors decide on this lock technique which expects them to draw a confidential design on a grid of specks to ingress the device.

The south coast of South Africa boasts an exceptional record of coastal hunter-gatherer occupation spanning the Holocene, the last glacial cycle and beyond. The significance of coastal adaptations, in this region in particular, for later modern human evolution has been prominently debated. Shellfishing behaviors are an important focus for investigation given the dietary and scheduling implications and the abundant archaeological shell remains in numerous sites. Key to better understanding coastal foraging is whether it was limited to one particular season, or year-round. Yet, this has proven very difficult to establish by conventional archaeological methods. This study reconstructs seasonal harvesting patterns by calculating water temperatures from the final growth increment of shells. Results from two Later Stone Age sites, Nelson Bay Cave (together with the nearby Hoffman's Robberg Cave) and Byneskranskop 1, show a pronounced cool season signal, which is unexpected given previous ethnographic documentation of summer as the optimal season for shellfishing activities and inferences about hunter-gatherer scheduling and mobility in the late Holocene. Results from two Middle Stone Age sites, Klasies River and Pinnacle Point 5–6, show distinct seasonal patterns that likely reflect the seasonal availability of resources in the two locations. The Pinnacle Point 5–6 assemblage, which spans the MIS5-4 transition, records a marked shift in shellfishing seasonality at c. 71 ka that aligns with other indications of archaeological and environmental change at this time. We conclude that the scheduling and intensity of shellfishing in this region is affected by a suite of factors, including environmental and cultural drivers, rather than a single variable, such as population growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Later Stone Age; Middle Stone Age; Oxygen isotopes; Sclerochronology; Seasonality; Shellfishing","Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Archaeology; Diet; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Seasons; Shellfish; Klasies River; Pinnacle Point; South Africa; Western Cape; chronology; harvesting; hunter-gatherer; mollusc culture; oxygen isotope; seasonality; Stone Age; animal; appetitive behavior; archeology; diet; fossil; hominid; human; season; shellfish","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059777449"

Many authentication systems are available for the protection of individuals' data, and the password authentication system is one of them. Due to the increment of information sharing, internet popularization, electronic commerce transactions, and data transferring, both password security and authenticity have become an essential and necessary subject. But it is also mandatory to ensure the strength of the password. For that reason, all cyber experts recommend intricate password patterns. But most of the time, the users forget their passwords because of those complicated patterns. In this paper, we are proposing a unique algorithm that will generate a strong password, unlike other existing random password generators. This password will he based on the information, i.e. (some words and numbers) provided by the users so that they do not feel challenged to remember the password. We have tested our system through various experiments using synthetic input data. We also have checked our generator with four popular online password checkers to verify the strength of the produced passwords. Based on our experiments, the reliability of our generated passwords is entirely satisfactory. We also have examined that our generated passwords can defend against two password cracking attacks named the ""Dictionary attack"" and the ""Brute Force attack"". We have implemented our system in Python programming language. In the near future, we have a plan to extend our work by developing an online free to use user interface. The passwords generated by our system are not only user-friendly but also have achieved most of the qualities of being strong as well as non- crackable passwords. © 2019 IEEE.","Auto-generated; Brute Force Attack; Case sensitive words; Combination of numbers; Dictionary Attack; Password cracking; Password entropy; Password generator; Randomization technique; Special characters; Strength checkers; Strong password pattern","Computer crime; Electric equipment protection; Mobile telecommunication systems; User interfaces; Auto-generated; Brute-force attack; Combination of numbers; Dictionary attack; Password cracking; Password generator; Randomization techniques; Special characters; Strength checkers; Strong password; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077955571"

In its simplest form, the approach consists of selecting a particular crime problem, such as youth homicide; convening an interagency working group of law enforcement practitioners; conducting research to identify key offenders, groups, and behavior patterns; framing a response to offenders and groups of offenders that uses a varied menu of sanctions to stop them from continuing their violent behavior; focusing social services and community resources on targeted offenders and groups to match law enforcement prevention efforts; and directly and repeatedly communicating with offenders to make them understand why they are receiving this special attention (Kennedy, 1997; Kennedy, Chapter 9 in this volume). Although the goal of focused deterrence strategies is to prevent crime by changing offender perceptions of sanction risk, other complementary crime prevention mechanisms seem to support the crime control efficacy of these programs (Braga & Kennedy, 2012; Kennedy, Kleiman & Braga, 2017). These strategies are also intended to change offender behavior by mobilizing community action, enhancing procedural justice, and improving police legitimacy. © Cambridge University Press 2019.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125410822"

This paper proposes a new vehicle identification system to obtain high degree of accuracy and success rate by not only considering the license plate but also shape of the vehicle. The proposed system is based on four steps: license plate detection, license plate recognition, license plate jurisdiction (province) detection and the vehicle shape detection. In the proposed system, the features are converted into local binary pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as training dataset. To obtain high degree of accuracy in real-time application, a novel method based on cascaded classifiers is used to update the system. The proposed system allows us to store features of vehicles and related information in the database, thus, allowing us to automatically detect any discrepancy between a license plate and vehicle associated with it.  © 2019 ACM.","Binarization; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG); Intelligent Transport System; License Plate Detection; Local Binary Pattern (LBP); Vehicle Identification","Automatic vehicle identification; Intelligent systems; Mobile computing; Optical character recognition; Traffic control; High degree of accuracy; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Intelligent transport systems; License plate detection; License plate recognition; Local binary patterns; Vehicle identification; Vehicle license plates; License plates (automobile)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098267999"

In this background, the new concept of intelligence-led-policing was proposed. This concept indicated that police should actively identify and analyze the problems by collecting data, such that the potential threatens could be known in early stage and prevention resources would be deployed in more efficient ways. In this paper, a typical work big data analysis in policing was introduced. Pickpocketing offence is a kind of frequently occurred crime in public transportation, and identifying offenders is a great challenge for the police. With nearly a billion of metro subway traffic records accessed from Beijing metro line company, the passengers' routine mobility pattern was analyzed and some pickpocketing suspects were detected by defining some specific rules. The results indicated that significant traveling patterns exist for routine passengers, and some exceptional individuals who has the unique pattern which is quite different from routine passengers are discovered. However, the shortage of the work still exists as the identity of cardholders is anonymous and it cannot be confirmed, but it still provides an example of big data analysis in public security, which might inspire police for further work. © 2019 IEEE.","big data; data mining; pick-pocketing theft; Spatial and temporal distribution","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Crime; Data handling; Railroads; Subways; Further works; Mobility pattern; pick-pocketing theft; Police forces; Public security; Public transportation; Spatial and temporal distribution; Traffic records; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066604630"

However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data; China; Crime pattern theory; Internal migrant; Native; Routine activity theory","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063663493"

Continuous authentication based on the characterization of user behavior, both in terms of user interaction patterns and usage patterns, is emerging as an effective solution for mitigating identity theft, and could become an important component of defense-in-depth strategies in cyber-physical systems as well. In this paper, the interaction between an attacker and an operator using continuous authentication is modeled as a stochastic game. In the model, the attacker observes and learns the behavioral patterns of an authorized user whom it aims at impersonating, whereas the operator designs the security measures to detect suspicious behavior and to prevent unauthorized access while minimizing the monitoring expenses. It is shown that the optimal attacker strategy exhibits a threshold structure, and consists of observing the user behavior to collect information at the beginning, and then attacking (rather than observing) after gathering enough data. From the operator’s side, the optimal design of the security measures is provided. Numerical results are used to illustrate the intrinsic trade-off between monitoring cost and security risk, and show that continuous authentication can be effective in minimizing security risk. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Continuous authentication; Dynamic stochastic game; Markov decision process","Authentication; Behavioral research; Crime; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Markov processes; Mobile telecommunication systems; Stochastic systems; Behavioral patterns; Continuous authentications; Defense in depth strategy; Dynamic stochastic games; Effective solution; Markov Decision Processes; Numerical results; Unauthorized access; Game theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076429620"

Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes. Methods: Geocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime. Results: Accounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted. Conclusions: The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes. © 2019, The Author(s).","China; Crime location choice; Mobility; Routine activities; Theft from the person","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061498104"

Most existing defense strategies for ransomware, however, are vulnerable to privileged ransomware who can compromise the operating system and hence any backup data stored locally. The out-of-place-update and the isolation nature of flash memory storage, for the first time, makes it possible to design a defense strategy which is secure against the privileged ransomware. In this work, we propose MimosaFTL, a secure and practical ransomware defense strategy for mobile computing devices equipped with flash memory as external storage. MimosaFTL is secure against the privileged malware by taking advantage of unique characteristics of flash storage. In addition, it is more practical (compared to prior work) for real-world deployments by: 1) incorporating a fine-grained detection scheme which can detect presence of ransomware accurately; and 2) allowing the victim to efficiently restore the infected external storage to the exact point when the malware starts to perform corruption. Experimental evaluation shows that, MimosaFTL can mitigate ransomware attacks effectively with a small negative impact on both I/O performance and lifetime of flash storage. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Access patterns; Binary search; Flash translation layer; Mobile devices; Ransomware; Ransomware detection","Computer crime; Data privacy; Flash memory; Mobile computing; Network security; Access patterns; Binary search; Defense strategy; Detection scheme; Experimental evaluation; Flash translation layer; Mobile computing devices; Real world deployment; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063873891"

Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not.

Nowadays, online transactions, mobile wallets and payment card transactions are becoming more popular within society. With the growth of such cashless transactions, the number of fraudulent activities in the world is also increasing. According to the current global economic context, efforts being made to detect and prevent frauds are also increasing. Having an effective financial transaction fraud detection system could save trillions of dollars from fraudulent activities. Supervised machine learning based fraud detection solution is the trending mechanism used in fraud detection solutions. Nevertheless, such supervised machine learning based solutions need a labelled dataset in order to train the machine learning model. The reason for the existence of current fraudulent actions is that labelled datasets are hard to find in real-world environments, and if such labelled datasets are , thereafter such fraud detection solutions would detect fraudulent patterns based on the fraudulent patterns of the fraudulent events in the training labelled dataset. Therefore, there is an extensive business requirement of having a fraud detection solution which can be trained using a raw financial transaction dataset, in other words using an unlabelled dataset which is commonly in financial transaction systems in order to detect accurate fraudulent events. Test results obtained for the synthetically generated dataset shows that autoencoder is able to detect fraudulent transaction events with 83% of AUC score which represents high capability of binary classification as fraudulent or genuine transactions. © 2019 IEEE.","autoencoders; fraud detection; unsupervised machine learning","Classification (of information); Crime; Electronic commerce; Finance; Losses; Statistical tests; Supervised learning; Binary classification; Financial organizations; Financial transactions; Fraud detection system; Fraudulent transactions; Machine learning models; Real world environments; Supervised machine learning; Learning systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087220341"

Design/methodology/approach: Legal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes. Findings: Results of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements. Originality/value: This paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Breach of fiduciary duty; Business law; Corporate insiders; Insider trading","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069541722"

Examples include extremist and criminal behaviors such as radicalization and cyber-bullying, which are causing serious issues for humanity. Major barriers to the effective understanding of behavioral disorders on social networks includes the ability to understand the content and context of social documents, as well as the activity of social users. Understanding the patterns of behavioral disorders (e.g., criminal and extremist activities) on social networks, is challenging and requires techniques to contextualize the content of social documents based on the time-aware analysis of personality, behaviour and past activities of social users. In this context, semantic information extraction and enrichment from social documents has the potential to become a vital asset to explore the sign of behavioral disorders and prevent serious issues such as cyber-bullying, suicidal related behavior and radicalization. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a novel social document analysis pipeline to enable analysts engage with social documents (e.g., a Tweet in Twitter or a post on Facebook) to explore cognitive aspects of behavioral disorders. We implement the pipeline as an extensible and scalable architecture and present the evaluation results.  © 2019 ACM.","Behavioral Analytics; Context-aware Applications; Data Curation","Crime; Mobile computing; Pipelines; Semantics; Cognitive aspects; Contextualize; Cyber bullying; Document analysis; Evaluation results; Scalable architectures; Semantic information extractions; Smart devices; Social networking (online)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095381389"

It begins by considering the types of crimes and punishments prevalent in Qajar Iran before examining the spatial exceptions to the operation of law in the form of sanctuaries (bast). It then explores exceptional circumstances under which crime and violence went unpunished, such as large-scale mobilizations involving powerful urban notables. Conflicts over Islamic endowment resources, embedded spatially in shrines and mosques, pitted neighborhoods against one another, with the state playing the role of a mediator and trying to manage social conflict. Raids into Jewish quarters reflected spatially structured conflicts, as well, because the appropriation of economic resources was at stake. Much like sanctuaries, Jewish quarters had an exceptional spatial status since violence, pillage, and plunder could occur there with relative impunity during specific historical moments. This article then analyzes the economic activities of lutis, who were often part of extortion rackets as a supplementary or primary form of employment. The article ends by considering the social biography of a well-known luti whose life exemplifies how lutis faced state sanction when engaged in petty crimes but acted with impunity when operating as part of a powerful vertical social network. I argue that the daily patterns of violence involving marginal groups revolved around access to the resources of the specific aforementioned spaces and that sanctuaries created opportunities for these marginal groups to evade the implementation of the law. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, when encountering hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery (VA), the procedure is more challenging and requires complicated operation techniques. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of this group of cases and investigated reasonable transposition procedures for different anatomic classifications. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 117 cases that underwent their first microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm between June 2010 and December 2016, which had all associated with vertebral artery compression diagnosed by preoperational radiology examination. The study first classified offending vessels into 3 types according to operative anatomy and designed personalized decompression management according to different forms of neurovascular conflict. Curative effects and complications were assessed. Results: The offending vessels were artificially divided into 3 types according to both arterial pattern and compression direction: 1) ipsilateral VA plus anterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the ventrolateral direction in 72 (61.5%) cases; 2) ipsilateral VA plus posterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the caudal-medial direction in 31 (26.5%) cases; 3) bilateral VA compressing the facial nerve in 14 (12.0%) cases. We selected corridors to expose the neurovascular conflict site between the suprafloccular-transhorizontal fissure approach and subtonsillar-transcerebellomedullary fissure approach. The methods of decompression consist of anteromedial and posterolateral transposition by using biomedical glue−coated Teflon sling. Sufficient decompression of the offending vessels was safely performed in all cases. All cases had total relief of symptoms immediately after their operations. Follow-up periods ranged from 16–90 months, and total recovery occurred in 110 cases (94.0%). In 7 cases (6.0%), 90% recovery occurred. Conclusions: Accuracy and comprehensive recognition of anatomic features of the offending vessels are crucial for the management of hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery compression. Appropriate approaches combined with the biomedical glue−coated Teflon sling transposition technique can allow adequate mobilization of the vertebral artery and bring complete postoperative symptom relief for most cases. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Abnormal muscle response; Biomedical glue sling technique; Brainstem auditory evoked potential; Hemifacial spasm; Microvascular decompression; Neurovascular conflict; Vertebral artery","Adhesives; Adult; Cerebellum; Cerebral Angiography; Computed Tomography Angiography; Equipment and Supplies; Facial Nerve Diseases; Female; Hemifacial Spasm; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Microvascular Decompression Surgery; Middle Aged; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Retrospective Studies; Vertebral Artery; botulinum toxin; fibrin glue; gelatin sponge; politef; adhesive agent; politef; adult; anterior inferior cerebellar artery; artery compression; Article; biomedical glue coated teflon sling transposition; clinical feature; evaluation and follow up; evoked brain stem auditory response; facial nerve; female; follow up; hemifacial spasm; high frequency hearing loss; human; major clinical study; male; meningitis; microvascular decompression; muscle transposition; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; postoperative complication; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; retrospective study; spine radiography; subtonsillartranscerebellomedullary fissure approach; supraflocculartranshorizontal fissure approach; surgical patient; vertebral artery; brain angiography; cerebellum; computed tomographic angiography; devices; diagnostic imaging; facial nerve disease; hemifacial spasm; magnetic resonance angiography; microvascular decompression; middle aged; nerve compression; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; vascularization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054427422"

For each event, its geographic location, time and related attributes are known with high levels of detail (LoDs). The LoD plays a crucial role when analyzing data, as it can highlight useful patterns or insights and enhance the user’ perception of phenomena. For this reason, modeling phenomena at different LoDs is needed to increase the analytical value of the data, as there is no exclusive LOD at which the data can be analyzed. Current practices work mainly on a single LoD of the phenomena, driven by the analysts’ perception, ignoring that identifying the suitable LoDs is a key issue for pointing relevant patterns. This article presents a Visual Analytics approach called VAST, that allows users to simultaneously inspect a phenomenon at different LoDs, helping them to see in what LoDs do interesting patterns emerge, or in what LoDs the perception of the phenomenon is different. In this way, the analysis of vast amounts of spatiotemporal events is assisted, guiding the user in this process. The use of several synthetic and real datasets supported the evaluation and validation of VAST, suggesting LoDs with different interesting spatiotemporal patterns and pointing the type of expected patterns. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data visualization; Multiple levels of detail; Spatiotemporal patterns; Visual analytics","Deforestation; Visualization; Geographic location; Human interactions; Infectious disease; Multiple levels of detail; Relevant patterns; Spatio-temporal events; Spatiotemporal patterns; Visual analytics; Data visualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071005832"

With Mobile Ad-Hoc Network, there are many challenges. These networks are more susceptible to attacks such as black hole and man-in-the-middle (MITM) than their corresponding wired networks. This is due to the decentralized nature of their overall architecture. In this paper, ANN classification methods in intrusion detection for MANETs were developed and used with NS2 simulation platform for attack detection, identification, blacklisting, and node reconfiguration for control of nodes attacked. The ANN classification algorithm for intrusion detection was evaluated using several metrics. The performance of the ANN as a predictive technique for attack detection, isolation, and reconfiguration was measured on a dataset with network-varied traffic conditions and mobility patterns for multiple attacks. With a final detection rate of 88.235%, this work not only offered a productive and less expensive way to perform MITM attacks on simulation platforms but also identified time as a crucial factor in determining such attacks as well as isolating nodes and reconfiguring the network under attack. This work is intended to be an opening for future malicious software time signature creation, identification, isolation, and reconfiguration to supplement existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). © 2019 Robert A.

Yet a full empirical validation of the latter is lacking. The prime reason is that prior studies are limited to aggregated statistics of human visitors rather than mobility flows and, because of that, neglect the temporal dynamics of individual human movements. As a remedy, we provide the first work which studies the ability of granular human mobility in describing and predicting crime concentrations at an hourly scale. For this purpose, we propose the use of data from location technology platforms. This type of data allows us to trace individual transitions and, therefore, we succeed in distinguishing different mobility flows that (i) are incoming or outgoing from a neighborhood, (ii) remain within it, or (iii) refer to transitions where people only pass through the neighborhood. Our evaluation infers mobility flows by leveraging an anonymized dataset from Foursquare that includes almost 14.8 million consecutive check-ins in three major U.S. cities. According to our empirical results, mobility flows are significantly and positively linked to crime. These findings advance our theoretical understanding, as they provide confirmatory evidence for crime pattern theory. Furthermore, our novel use of digital location services data proves to be an effective tool for crime forecasting. It also offers unprecedented granularity when studying the connection between human mobility and crime. Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Machine learning techniques are used as a proof-of-concept so as to evaluate the detection capabilities of the detection model, when compared to a clean snapshot of the target device. Mal-warehouse is publicly available, meaning that anyone can download and use it locally and then upload their findings to the cloud service for further evaluation and processing by others. © 2018 IEEE.","Android; Behavioral Patterns; Data Collection; Machine Learning; Malware Detection; Mobile Malware","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer crime; Data acquisition; Learning systems; Malware; Smart city; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; Warehouses; Android; Behavioral patterns; Data collection; Malware detection; Mobile malware; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060294820"

The method of ESDA (Exploration of Spatial Data Analysis) is proposed for identifying crime hotspots and test their significance. The results demonstrate that identified significant crime hotspots varied by time of day and day of week. Specifically, the burglary was observed to be clustered in center and south of Chaoyang district but none in northern.

Despite crime and disorder exhibiting similar spatiotemporal patterns, as hypothesized by broken windows and collective efficacy theories, past studies often analyze a single outcome and overlook the correlation structures between multiple crime and disorder types. Accounting for five covariates, the best-fitting model partitions the residual risk of each crime and disorder type into one spatial shared component, one temporal shared component, and type-specific spatial, temporal, and space–time components. The shared components capture the underlying spatial pattern and time trend common to all types of crime and disorder. Results show that population size, residential mobility, and the central business district are positively associated with all outcomes. The spatial shared component is found to explain the largest proportion of residual variability for all types of crime and disorder. Spatiotemporal hotspots of crime and disorder are examined to contextualize broken windows theory. Applications of multivariate spatiotemporal modeling with shared components to ecological crime theories and crime prevention policy are discussed. © 2018 The Ohio State University","","correlation; crime; multivariate analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical study; trend analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055547481"

Popular quotations «qui prodesse» and «сherchez la femme» are combined from these positions in the non-standard authors’ approach to understanding the motivational factors underlying extremist movements. It has been proved that the increase in the number of women in the ranks of terrorists is largely due to the so-called economic benefit factor for the terrorist acts organisers. The actions of a suicide bomber, in the broad sense, are predominantly based on a rational basis: the achievement of the last personal good - identity. The article presents the transformation of female terrorism in the historical perspective; actual conflicts and contradictions in international law and national legal systems, as well as false social attitudes and stereotypes complicating the fight against this dangerous social phenomenon. Data obtained from the social networks allows concluding that hundreds of women are now fighting in the ranks of militants in the East of Ukraine. At the beginning of the conflict, many of them hid their faces on personal pages on the Internet, hiding from their relatives a fact that they are hired killers. At the moment, most of them are proud of their participation in extremist groups, post their photos with weapons. Suicide terrorism of Muslim women and crimes committed by female militants in the East of Ukraine have one thing in common - the preparation and use of women as a living «weapon» by the extremist groups is cheaper either in terms of financial investments and costs for psychological brainwashing and military training. Based on the analytical data and identified patterns, we have argued the strategic directions of counteraction to female terrorism and have proved the following: mankind will be able to break this danger on the condition of a new, free of stereotypes way of thinking and coordinated efforts of the world community in all spheres of social life including economic, legal, socio- and cultural ones. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2019","Economic Background; Female Terrorism; Legal Conflicts; Rational Choice; Strategy of Eradicating Female Terrorism","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077920771"

In this paper, we estimate the pattern of relation between packets dropped to packets sent, that is packet delivery fraction (PDF) by Wormhole attack using regression analysis, a machine learning approach, by method of least square (MLS), and least absolute deviation (LAD). A comparative analysis between these two techniques is done. As there is high degree of linearity between packets sent and packets dropped by Wormhole attack, the pattern of dropped packet is proved by MLS regression and LAD regression. Accuracy is also tested. MLS and LAD regression algorithms are also developed to estimate this pattern for Wormhole attack. Wormhole attackers create a duplicate tunnel (wired link or high frequency) from source to destination. An illusion is created by this, that the distance through this tunnel from source to destination is minimal and must take less time. Comparing to this fake tunnel, the original route takes more time. So it is necessary to calculate the time taken to estimate the relation of packets dropped to packets sent by Wormhole attack. Better performance by linear regression analysis for pattern estimation of these dropped packets is proved by simulation, done by MATLAB simulator for Wormhole attack. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","Absolute deviation; LAD; MANET; MLS; Regression; Wormhole attack","Least squares approximations; MATLAB; Mobile ad hoc networks; Packet loss; Regression analysis; Absolute deviations; Least absolute deviations (LAD); Machine learning approaches; MANET; Method of least squares; Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF); Regression; Wormhole attack; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073895788"

The analysis modeled the four daily human routine periods described in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Generalized linear simultaneous negative binomial regression model was used to determine the size of the influence of the variables (beta coefficients) and their significance for each model outcome. The findings show some distinct patterns of street robbery due to the immediate and lagged effects of the variables relatable to the study environment’s unique setting. Two variables, geographic mobility, and barbershops were particularly significant across three of the outcome models. The results suggest that the physical and social structure of neighborhoods determined by land-use regulations would enhance understanding of the time-based influence on robbery patterns due to crime-attracting facilities. © The Author(s) 2020.","crime pattern theory; robbery; routine activities theory; spatial lag","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092720289"

Various mediums like social media are used for communication business, organizational details, etc. Due to the increase in technology, there are chances of performing the crimes in newer ways. Using these Social Networking Sites (SNS), many criminal activities have the ability to extract the information. Such activities are spamming, cyber prediction, cyber threatening, killing, blackmailing, phishing, etc. The suspicious messages can be transferred via different SNS, mobile phones, or other sources. Most of the crime-related activities on information on a web are in text format, which is tedious task to trace those criminal activities. Detecting and exploring the crime and identifying the criminals are involved in the analyzing “crime process.” Criminology is a field of using text mining techniques that describe the complexity of relationship between crime datasets. Text mining technique is an effective way to detect and predict criminal activities. Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information or knowledge or patterns from the unstructured text that are from different sources. Since this uses text mining algorithm to continuously check for suspicious words even if they are in short forms or phrases, then they find social graph of users. In this framework, n-gram technique with SCHITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm is used to find suspected message, user, sessions, etc. Information can be extracted using social graph-based text mining, and also the suspected user’s profile has been found. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Cybercrime investigation; Social graph; Social network analysis (SNA)","Computer crime; Crime; Data communication systems; Graphic methods; Hypertext systems; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Communication business; Criminal activities; Cybercrime investigations; Interesting information; Modern technologies; Social graphs; Social networking sites; Text mining techniques; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059662338"

This paper aims to prevent the crime related to ATM card frauds and secure transaction. In this paper, two options are included like One Time Password (OTP) and Fingerprint detection for a successful transaction. The user can use any of the two options mentioned above for ATM transactions. We know that the OTP is valid for only one transaction and a specific duration. Thus, the Global System for Mobile (GSM) is used for the generation of OTP and that OTP is sent to the mobile number to which the bank account is linked. In case, if the user does not have the mobile to which the bank account is linked or else the mobile is switched off or network problem the second option of fingerprint authentication can be used. The fingerprint of the user must be linked with the bank account so that the unique pattern of the fingerprint can be used to make a successful transaction. Hence this project will increase security and add privacy by making use of biomedical authentication that is fingerprint pattern detection. Therefore this added feature helps to reduce the crimes related to ATM cards. © 2019 IEEE.","Fingerprint sensor module; GSM module; OTP","Authentication; Crime; Global system for mobile communications; Internet protocols; Palmprint recognition; Automated teller machines; Bank accounts; Fingerprint authentication; Fingerprint detections; Fingerprint pattern; Global system for mobiles; One time passwords; Secure transactions; Automatic teller machines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085318732"

To effectively prevent urban crime, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the daily living patterns of urban residents and the geographic characteristics of each area. However, Korea’s crime prevention policies have often been determined based on the preferences of policy makers and the demands of residents, without consideration of accurate data. In addition, most preceding research on crime has focused on the distribution of crime based on administrative neighborhoods.

The core argument is that regimes can anticipate the events that create these focal points and engage in preemptive repression to survive their passing. This dynamic produces predictable, often cyclical patterns in repression. An analysis of dissident detentions in China from 1998 to 2014 shows that “focal events” alone appear to be responsible for more than 20 percent of dissident detentions over the analysis period. Such detentions tend to be shorter and rely less on formal criminal procedures, suggesting a “catch-and-release” dynamic. Additional analysis of detentions in Tibet shows how the calendar may vary by issue or group. © The Author(s) 2018.","authoritarian; China; collective action; detention; dissidents; focal point; human rights; mobilization; preemptive; repression; Tibet","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046828026"

While extant studies of the American criminal justice system have found that mass incarceration and felon disenfranchisement negatively impact political participation and engagement, few have explicitly explored policing’s relationship with politics and fewer still consider its mobilizing potential. Mobilizing data from over 2.7 million geo-coded police stops and data from a series of national and municipal elections this paper uncovers a pattern of voter demobilization, voter mobilization, and candidate choice that cannot be anticipated from extant studies in the literature. Specifically, it finds that while concentrated policing was associated with reductions in voter turnout in the 2006 and 2010 midterm elections, it was associated with higher rates of turnout in the 2008 presidential election and 2013 Democratic primary and general mayor. Further analysis demonstrates that stopping intensity was strongly associated with candidate choice in the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary, such that higher rates of policing were positively associated with support for the candidate (John Liu) who advocated for eliminating SQF and less support for the candidate (William Thompson) who supported SQF. Together, these findings highlight the impact that policing can exert on political behavior, characterize the impact that harmful policing policies can play in instigating policing participation and engagement, and foreground the importance of considering local criminal justice policy and political action. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carceral state; Policing; Policy threat; Stop and Frisk; Voter turnout","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065716769"

Spatial information about the offender’s house, the victim’s house, and the crime scene was combined in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the assaults fall in the categories of total mobility (42.78%) and offender mobility (33.10%). Our results also show the validity of the distance decay function with over 50% of aggressions occurring within 3 km of the offender’s house. The analysis did not reveal the existence of buffer zones, probably due to the acquaintance between some of the offenders and their victims. The evidence suggests that environmental risk factors are more significant than individual ones when it comes to explaining the variation among mobility patterns in sexual assaults. Offenders appear to adapt their mobility patterns and modus operandi according to the environmental constraints. Often, offenders choose their own or their victim’s house as a safe environment for performed sexual assault. © The Author(s) 2018.","rape; schema; sexual abuse; sexual offender; typology; victim","Aggression; Crime; Crime Victims; Criminals; Environment; Humans; Sex Offenses; aggression; crime; crime victim; environment; human; offender; psychology; sexual crime","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049657792"

Therefore, we propose a location prediction model called SSLP (spatio-temporal semantics location prediction) to enhance the location prediction performance. Firstly, the similar suspect groups of the target suspects are extracted using the distributed proximity of the suspects in different semantic periods and semantic positions. Then, their mobility data are applied to estimate transition frequencies and temporal visiting probabilities for unobserved locations based on a KDE (kernel density estimating) smoothing method. Finally, by a Bayesian-based formula, the spatio-temporal prediction for the individual suspect can be realized. In the experiments with the location recording data set consisting of 158 suspects and their 17 539 location records from January to June 2013 in W city, SSLP model outperforms baseline algorithms by 40%-50%, validating its adaptability for data sparsity problem. © 2019, Editorial Department of Wuhan University of Technology.

This weakness may be alleviated by the use of ambient population, derived from social media data such as tweets. This research aims to examine the degree in which geotagged tweets, in contrast to the Census population, can explain crime. In addition, the mobility of Twitter users suggests that tweets as the ambient population may have a spillover effect on the neighboring areas. Based on a yearlong geotagged tweets dataset, negative binomial regression models are used to test the impact of tweets derived ambient population, as well as its possible spillover effect on theft crimes. Results show: (1) Tweets count is a viable replacement of the Census population for spatial theft pattern analysis; (2) tweets count as a measure of the ambient population shows a significant spillover effect on thefts, while such spillover effect does not exist for the Census population; (3) the combination of tweets and its spatial lag outperforms the Census population in theft crime analyses. Therefore, the spillover effect of the tweets derived ambient population should be considered in future crime analyses. This finding may be applicable to other social media data as well. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambient population; Crime; Negative binomial; Neighborhood; Spatial lag; Tweet","algorithm; antisocial behavior; crime; neighborhood; resident population; social behavior; social media; spillover effect; tagging; World Wide Web","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077315158"

The data consisted of variables relating to target selection behaviors and decision making of 104 serial residential burglars, who had arrest records for residential burglaries in the past. The results of multiple correspondence analysis revealed that residential burglars' target selection behaviors could be differentiated into three styles: “burgling in the absence of residents”, “burgling in the presence of residents while they are sleeping at night”, and “burgling of mixed styles”. Among 14 variables relating to burglars' decision making while committing crimes, three factors (risk/reward-oriented, traceless entry-oriented, low effort area-oriented) were extracted by exploratory factor analysis. The level of burgling skill evaluated by the suspect interviewers positively correlated with a factor score of the “risk/reward-oriented” factor (ρ = .20, p < .05) but negatively correlated with a factor score of the “low effort area-oriented” factor (ρ = - .24, p < .05).

However, an attack can be initiated by simply copying the 2D barcode and attaching it to a counterfeit product. In this paper, we aim at proposing an authentication scheme with a mobile imaging device for a 2D barcode. This work presents a competitive solution among the 2D barcode authentication schemes that have been verified under mobile imaging conditions. The proposed copy-proof scheme is composed of two sets of features which are extracted by exploiting the characteristics of barcoding channel models. The proposed features identify the intrinsic differences between genuine and counterfeit barcode images in the frequency and spatial domains. An efficient two-stage barcode authentication framework is then proposed by combining the two sets of features in a cascading manner. To evaluate the practicality of the proposed authentication scheme, four databases with different devices (printers, scanners, mobile cameras), barcode sizes, and barcode designs are considered in the experiments. By comparing with the existing texture descriptors and some deep learning-based approaches, it is shown that the proposed scheme has a higher authentication accuracy under various conditions, such as cross-database, cross-size and cross-pattern experiments which study the generalities of a pre-trained model towards challenging conditions commonly found in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, the proposed scheme has been evaluated under some state-of-the-art attack scenarios where the attacker employs several realizations of genuine patterns or the deep learning-based technique to produce a counterfeit copy.

For each event, its geographic location, time and related attributes are known with high levels of detail (LoDs). The LoD plays a crucial role when analyzing data, enhancing the user's perception of phenomena. From one LoD to another, some patterns can be easily perceived or different patterns may be detected. Modeling phenomena at different LoDs is needed, as there is no exclusive LoD at which data can be analyzed. Current practices work mainly on a single LoD, driven by the analysts perception, ignoring the fact that the identification of the suitable LoDs is a key issue for pointing relevant patterns. This paper presents a Visual Analytics approach called VAST, that allows users to simultaneously inspect a phenomenon at different LoDs, helping them to see in what LoDs patterns emerge or in what LoDs the perception of the phenomenon is different. In this way, the analysis of vast amounts of spatiotemporal events is assisted, guiding the user in this process. The use of several synthetic and real datasets allowed the evaluation of VAST, which was able to suggest LoDs with different interesting spatiotemporal patterns and the type of expected patterns. © 2018 IEEE.","Data-Visualisation; Multiple Levels of Detail; Spatiotemporal-Patterns; Visual Analytics","Data visualization; Deforestation; Geographic location; Human interactions; Infectious disease; Multiple levels of detail; Spatio-temporal events; Spatiotemporal patterns; User's perceptions; Visual analytics; Visualization","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060142955"

Previous approaches on solving the TUL task generally rely on classic models or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. However, their prediction accuracy is always not satisfactory due to the following reasons: 1) trajectory data is low-sampling and sparse; 2) user mobility patterns are high-order and multi-periodic; and 3) previous approaches fail to utilize existing abundant features. In this paper, we propose DeepTUL, which is composed of a feature representation layer and a recurrent network with attention mechanism, to solve TUL task. DeepTUL not only combines multiple features that govern user mobility to model high-order and complex mobility patterns, but also learns from labeled historical trajectory to capture multi-periodic nature of user mobility and alleviate the data sparsity problem.

Methods Based on the principle of digital imaging and color pattern analysis, the mobile terminal of the device was used to collect images of bloodstains of different ages. The time-dependent pattern of 6 parameters (R, G, B, C, Y, M) reflecting the changes of color of images of different ages was obtained by computer image analysis. A multiparameter comprehensive inference equation of bloodstains age was established and embedded into the device software to realize the intelligent inference of the bloodstains age. Then the capability and reliability of the device was verified. Results This integrated device of bloodstains imaging and age analysis could quickly collect bloodstains at the crime scene and automatically analyze and infer the age of bloodstains combined with related intelligence software. In the blind test, the detection accuracy of this device was 95% in both natural light airtight group and dark airtight group, and 80% in the natural light ventilation group. Conclusion The integrated device of trace bloodstains imaging and age analysis can be used in a simple manner, which provides a new objective method for bloodstains age estimation. © 2019 by the Editorial Department of Journal of Forensic Medicine.","Blood stains; Forensic pathology; Image processing, computer-assisted; Remaining time","Blood Stains; Forensic Pathology; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Time Factors; blood stain; devices; forensic pathology; human; image processing; procedures; reproducibility; software; time factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066432929"

However, due to such rewards, these enterprises are facing key concerns around the risk of next-generation data security or cybercrime which is continually increasing issue due to the digital transformation four essential pillars—cloud computing, big data analytics, social and mobile computing. Data transformation-driven enterprises should ready to handle this next-generation data security problem, in particular, the compromised user credential (CUC). When an intruder or cybercriminal develops trust relationships as a legitimate account holder and then gain privileged access to the system for misuse. Many state-of-the-art risk mitigation tools are being developed, such as encrypted and secure password policy, authentication, and authorization mechanism. However, the CUC has become more complex and increasingly critical to the digital transformation process of the enterprise's database by a cybercriminal, we propose a novel technique that effectively detects CUC at the enterprise-level. The proposed technique is learning from the user's behavior and builds a knowledge base system (KBS) which observe changes in the user's operational behavior. For that reason, a series of experiments were carried out on the dataset that collected from a sensitive database. All empirical results are validated through well-known evaluation measures, such as (i) accuracy, (ii) sensitivity, (iii) specificity, (iv) prudence accuracy, (v) precision, (vi) f-measure, and (vii) error rate. The experiments show that the proposed approach obtained weighted accuracy up to 99% and overall error of about 1%. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently can detect CUC which may keep an organization safe from major damage in data through cyber-attacks. © 2018","Cluster-level pattern; Compromised activities detection; Compromised user detection; Knowledge-base system; Prudence analysis","Authentication; Big data; Computer crime; Cryptography; Customer satisfaction; Knowledge based systems; Metadata; Network security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Cluster-level pattern; Data transformation; Digital transformation; Evaluation measures; Knowledge base system; Operational behavior; Prudence analysis; User detection; Behavioral research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056460472"

By calculating and analyzing trajectory data, behavior patterns of mobile objects can be found. Among these behavior patterns the discovery of chasing patterns is interesting which will provide effective services for intelligent urban traffic management, criminal investigation, environmental monitoring and other application fields. However, existing chasing pattern discovery methods only compare the local similarity of trajectories, and do not consider the potential significance of stay points or change in speed. This article proposes a new algorithm for chasing pattern discovery based on the stay point detection technology. An optimized stay point detection algorithm is also designed to improve the distance calculation method. The algorithms were evaluated with real and simulation trajectory data and achieved very good results which have higher accuracy and recall rate compared with the existing chasing pattern discovery algorithms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Chasing patterns; Great circle distance; Stay point detection; Trajectory data","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Database systems; Environmental management; Quality control; Quality management; Selenium compounds; Semantics; Traffic control; Trajectories; Application fields; Behavior patterns; Criminal investigation; Distance calculation; Environmental Monitoring; Point detection algorithm; Temporal and spatial; Urban traffic management; Information management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092180896"

Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences. © 2019","Crime; Latent class model; Offence locations; Random parameter logit; Taste heterogeneity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073108406"

However, such assumptions often lack empirical evidence from the actual fraud perpetrators. To address this problem, in this paper, we present results of both a qualitative study with 18 ASO workers we recruited from 5 freelancing sites, concerning activities they performed on Google Play, and a quantitative investigation with fraud-related data collected from other 39 ASO workers. We reveal findings concerning various aspects of ASO worker capabilities and behaviors, including novel insights into their working patterns, and supporting evidence for several existing assumptions. Further, we found and report participant-revealed techniques to bypass Google-imposed verifications, concrete strategies to avoid detection, and even strategies that leverage fraud detection to enhance fraud efficacy. We report a Google site vulnerability that enabled us to infer the mobile device models used to post more than 198 million reviews in Google Play, including 9,942 fake reviews.

One of the most important costs for offenders is to be identified and arrested by police. In order to avoid arrest, offenders have to rely on specific strategies. In sexual assaults, in addition to appropriate target selection, offenders must make sure to avoid police detection by protecting their identity and cleaning up or destroy forensic evidence that may be left at the crime scene and that can directly lead to their identification. This behavior is known as ‘forensic awareness’. Research on forensic awareness strategies during the crime-commission process is scant. A number of studies looking specifically at sexual crimes identified certain strategies related to forensic awareness. According to the rational choice perspective, the use of strategies to avoid police detection should have an impact on the crime solving by police. Few studies have investigated this issue and findings are quite unexpected. The aim of this chapter is to review some of the most important empirical knowledge on the use of forensic awareness strategies in sexual crimes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Criminal investigation; Forensic strategies; Offender behavior; Police strategies; Sexual crime","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087184998"

Low-income, minority, older adults residing in inner-city neighborhoods are largely transit dependent, rely significantly on walking for transportation, and thus have particular mobility needs. We used a mixed-methods approach that drew information from the California Household Travel Survey but also from direct interaction (through focus groups, interviews, and neighborhood walking audits) with 81 low-income, inner city–living older adults to understand their travel patterns and mobility challenges and needs. We find that despite some positive mobility indicators in the inner city (mixed-use environment, frequent bus service, and short travel distances), these elders face significant mobility challenges because of a deteriorated built environment, heavy traffic, homelessness, and crime. A limitation of this research is that the small sample did not allow the study of possible gender or race/ethnicity differentiation in the travel patterns and needs of older adults. Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely only on information from the census and other aggregate data sources to understand the mobility needs of older adults but should complement this information with direct interaction with the communities for which they are planning. Although some social problems limiting the mobility of older adults are difficult to tackle, environmental and streetscape improvements can significantly enhance their mobility. © 2019, © 2019 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","inner city; Los Angeles mobility; older adults","California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; elderly population; inner city area; low income population; mobility; travel behavior; urban development; urban transport","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071370109"

Naturally, a fraction abuse ad networks to systematically defraud advertisers of their money. Modern defences have matured to overcome some forms of click fraud but measurement studies have reported that a third of clicks supplied by ad networks could be clickspam. Our work develops novel inference techniques which can isolate click fraud attacks using their fundamental properties.We propose two defences, mimicry and bait-click, which provide clickspam detection with substantially improved results over current approaches. Mimicry leverages the observation that organic clickfraud involves the reuse of legitimate click traffic, and thus isolates clickspam by detecting patterns of click reuse within ad network clickstreams. The bait-click defence leverages the vantage point of an ad network to inject a pattern of bait clicks into a user's device. Any organic clickspam generated involving the bait clicks will be subsequently recognisable by the ad network. Our experiments show that the mimicry defence detects around 81% of fake clicks in stealthy (low rate) attacks, with a false-positive rate of 110 per hundred thousand clicks. Similarly, the bait-click defence enables further improvements in detection, with rates of 95% and a reduction in false-positive rates of between 0 and 30 clicks per million - a substantial improvement over current approaches. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","","Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Clickstreams; False positive rates; Inference techniques; Measurement study; Over current; Revenue generation; Smartphone apps; Traffic analysis; Crime","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066755195"

Large amount of customer related telecom data from various sources are generated every day, from which diversified behavior patterns can be revealed, including some anomalous behaviors that are vicious. It becomes increasingly important to achieve both efficient and effective customer behavior analysis based on the telecom big data. In this paper, the Multi-faceted Telecom Customer Behavior Analysis (MTCBA) framework for anomalous telecom customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is proposed. In this framework, we further design the hierarchical Locality Sensitive Hashing-Local Outlier Factor (hierarchical LSH-LOF) scheme for suspicious customer detection, and the Autoencoders with Factorization Machines (FM-AE) structure for dimension reduction to achieve more efficient clustering. Hierarchical LSH-LOF is an improved algorithm of LOF, in which we design a hierarchical LSH process that selects the approximate k nearest neighbors from coarse to fine by gradually narrowing down the scope. Experiments show its superiority over KD-tree w.r.t searching speed. FM-AE exploits Factorization Machines for learning second order feature interactions, which we prove to be useful by designing comparative experiments with five dimension reduction algorithms. With the proposed MTCBA framework, efficient and effective telecom customer behavior analysis including anomalous customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is performed on the real world telecom operating data provided by one of the major Internet service providers (ISPs) in China. Meanwhile, interpretable clustering results of six clusters are obtained to provide valuable information for the precision marketing of telecom operators, criminal combating, and social credit system construction. © 2013 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Behavior analysis; Clustering analysis; Dimension reduction; Telecom operators","Anomaly detection; Clustering algorithms; Factorization; Internet service providers; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Reduction; Sales; Smartphones; Behavior analysis; Clustering analysis; Comparative experiments; Customer behavior analysis; Dimension reduction; Dimension reduction algorithm; Locality sensitive hashing; Telecom operators; Hierarchical clustering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082082721"

Consequently, they also have become one of the biggest targets of malware attacks. New malware is created everyday, most of which is generated as variants of existing malware by reusing its malicious code. This paper proposes an approach for malware detection and phylogeny studying based on dynamic analysis using process mining. The approach exploits process mining techniques to identify relationships and recurring execution patterns in the system call traces gathered from a mobile application in order to characterize its behavior. The recovered characterization is expressed in terms of a set of declarative constraints between system calls and represents a sort of run-time fingerprint of the application. The comparison between the so defined fingerprint of a given application with those of known malware is used to verify: (1) if the application is malware or trusted, (2) in case of malware, which family it belongs to, and (3) how it differs from other known variants of the same malware family. An empirical study conducted on a dataset of 1200 trusted and malicious applications across ten malware families has shown that the approach exhibits a very good discrimination ability that can be exploited for malware detection and malware evolution studying. Moreover, the study has also shown that the approach is robust to code obfuscation techniques increasingly being used by nowadays malware. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Declare; Linear temporal logic; Malware detection; Malware evolution; Malware phylogeny; Process mining; Security","Biology; Cellular telephone systems; Computer crime; Data mining; Global system for mobile communications; Intrusion detection; Declare; Linear temporal logic; Malware detection; Process mining; Security; Malware","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066349809"

As the computational needs are diversified, security threats are also getting complex to be detected. The traditional approaches require updation and are not able to cover the entire definitions of each kind of malicious code patterns. Therefore, an improvement in traditional approach is required to be incorporated. In this work, it is intended to search an adaptive approach by which the machine can learn and update itself from the last learning. Two different appropriate data models namely C4.5 decision tree and Bayes classifier have been used in this paper. Both the data models are promising and provide accurate classification with some limitations. To make improvement on it, a hybrid classification approach is designed using C4.5 decision tree and Bayes classifier. This work is implemented in JAVA and performance is evaluated on several parameters such as classification accuracy, space and time complexity. As per the obtained results, it is evident that the proposed technique is more accurate and efficient as compared to the respective implemented algorithms. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Bayes theorem; Classification; Decision tree; Machine learning; Malware detection","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Decision trees; Learning systems; Malware; Trees (mathematics); Bayes theorem; C4.5 decision tree algorithm; C4.5 decision trees; Classification accuracy; Hybrid classification; Malware detection; Space and time complexity; Traditional approaches; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058347029"

In a break with earlier patterns, the methods of covert surveillance are used extensively and are no longer regarded as a tactic of last resort. Covert policing is well anchored within organizational arrangements, empowered by a series of internal rationales mobilized to justify the expansion of covert tactics over and above more traditional, overt forms. The building of intrusive and exceptional policing practices within mundane contexts, I argue, is one of the ways the police have adapted to a broader policing environment characterized by public scepticism and distrust. Policing relies on the invisibility and low profile that comes with covert work, in order to govern contemporary concerns of crime and insecurity without the conflicts which can accompany – and trouble – overt policing practices. As mainstream policing becomes an increasingly extroverted enterprise, introverted forms of policing have come to the fore. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2019","Covert policing; new visibility; normalization; security; surveillance","Anthropology, Cultural; Crime; Culture; Humans; Law Enforcement; Organizational Culture; Police; United Kingdom; crime; cultural anthropology; human; law enforcement; organizational culture; police; prevention and control; procedures; United Kingdom","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062716825"

Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Android malware detection; ARPaD; LERP-RSA; Malware family classification; Text mining","Classification (of information); Data mining; Malware; Mobile telecommunication systems; Pattern recognition; Smartphones; Text processing; Android malware; ARPaD; LERP-RSA; Malware families; Text mining; Mobile security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078858025"

First, it analyses whether the decision to migrate relies upon individual characteristics. Second, it examines the ways in which the economic, social and environmental characteristics of the French territories determine the retirees' choice of localization. The paper draws upon a unique database of 12.67 million French inhabitants, with information about their personal attributes and locational choices from 2003 to 2008. It also uses an original database with locational characteristics for the French territories at the level of the 364 zones d'emploi. This is the only study on regional migration in France which builds upon such a thin spatial level of analysis. The paper builds empirical probit and Heckman models dealing with selection bias and endogeneity bias issues. The paper shows that retirees usually leave large agglomerations and old industrial areas in Northern France and the Paris agglomeration and relocate to socially and environmentally attractive zones with preferable climates. When studying the migration patterns within the zones d'emploi, it appears that the most vulnerable zones, which display a lower quality of collective services as well as higher income disparities and crime rates, feature lower elderly residential mobility. © 2018 The Author(s).

In order to capture the pattern of click fraud, priori probability is introduced and a new feature set is derived from the knowledge of entropy. Then, using cost-based sampling method and threshold-moving cost sensitive learning algorithm to solve unbalanced data training problems. Features are transformed into feature matrix by different time windows to fit the input of a convolutional neural network. Finally, considering the convolution kernel size, the number of convolution kernels and the pooling size of different network structures in this work, effective CSCNN structure was chosen.

Previous studies, however, do not include traveling companions in users' profiles, although performing activities in social groups is inherent to human behavior. Physical access control systems on smart buildings can provide activity companions information since social groups naturally emerge on organizations hosted in such buildings and these systems can capture group trajectories. This paper explores the feasibility of using spatiotemporal mobility profiles enriched with group trajectory pattern data as a novel framework for impersonation fraud detection in smart buildings.

Payment card fraud is a serious and long-term threat to society (Ryman-Tubb and d'Avila Garcez, 2010) with an economic impact forecast to be $416bn in 2017 (see Appendix A).1 The proceeds of this fraud are known to finance terrorism, arms and drug crime. Until recently the patterns of fraud (fraud vectors) have slowly evolved and the criminals modus operandi (MO) has remained unsophisticated. Disruptive technologies such as smartphones, mobile payments, cloud computing and contactless payments have emerged almost simultaneously with large-scale data breaches. This has led to a growth in new fraud vectors, so that the existing methods for detection are becoming less effective. This in turn makes further research in this domain important. In this context, a timely survey of published methods for payment card fraud detection is presented with the focus on methods that use AI and machine learning. The purpose of the survey is to consistently benchmark payment card fraud detection methods for industry using transactional volumes in 2017. This benchmark will show that only eight methods have a practical performance to be deployed in industry despite the body of research.

We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

Most malware programs use URLs inside network traffic to forward commands to launch malicious activities. Therefore, the detection of malicious URLs can be essential in deterring such malicious activities. Traditional methods construct blacklists with verified URLs to identify malicious URLs, but their effectiveness is impaired by unknown malicious URLs. Recently, machine learning-based methods have been proposed for malware detection with improved performance. In this paper, we propose a novel URL detection method based on Floating Centroids Method (FCM), which integrates supervised classification and unsupervised clustering in a coherent manner. The proposed method uses the lexical features of a URL to effectively identify malicious URLs while grouping similar URLs into the same cluster. Our experimental results show that a URL cluster exhibits unique behavioral patterns that can be used for malware detection with high accuracy. Moreover, the proposed behavioral clustering method facilitates the identification of malicious URL categories and unseen malware variants. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.","","Android (operating system); Cluster analysis; Computer crime; Supervised learning; Behavioral patterns; Clustering methods; Detection methods; Floating centroids methods; Malicious activities; Supervised classification; Tight integrations; Unsupervised clustering; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059677976"

A review of recent empirical papers published on two relevant databases allowed us to gather a sample of 88 papers published from 2010 to 2017 that analyse the role of situational factors of delinquent behaviour using quantitative methods and applying one of the situational theories. The results highlight the robustness of some situational and environmental variables for a deeper understanding of juvenile antisocial behaviour by putting it into context. There is a considerable amount of evidence to corroborate the impact of unstructured leisure activities on antisocial behaviour, or the role of home location in establishing a geographic area of action. However, there is ambiguous evidence on other aspects: i.e. guardianship needs to be understood and measure in a more complex way, and the role of physical design of the places where juvenile delinquency happens deserves further analysis. Future research lines from this perspective are needed and will offer relevant improvements for better understanding juvenile delinquency and designing more effective preventive measures. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antisocial behaviour; crime pattern theory; Juvenile delinquency; rational choice theory; routine activity theory; situational action theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063221874"

At the same time, researchers have proposed a large number of methods, both static and dynamic analysis methods, to fight against malwares. Among these, Machine learning based methods are quite effective in Android malware detection, the accuracy of which can be up to 98%. Thus, malware developers have the incentives to develop more advanced malwares to evade detection. This paper presents an adversary attack pattern that will compromise current machine learning based malware detection methods. The malware developers can perform this attack easily by splitting malicious payload into two or more apps. The split apps will all be classified as benign by current methods. Thus, we proposed a method to deal with this issue. This approach, realized in a tool, called ColluDroid, can identify the collusion apps by analyzing the communication between apps. The evaluation results show that ColluDroid is effective in finding out the collusion apps. Also, we showed that it’s easy to split an app to evade detection. According to our split simulation, the evasion rate is 78%, when split into two apps; while the evasion rate comes to 94.8%, when split into three apps. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Android security; Collusion attack; Machine learning","Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Computer crime; Learning systems; Network security; Android securities; Attack patterns; Collusion attack; Evaluation results; Malware detection; Number of methods; Popular platform; Static and dynamic analysis; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054786556"

First, we introduce location-dependent fingerprints as supplementary information for better location identification. A truth discovery algorithm is then proposed to detect falsified data.

Based on this case, the mobile forensic needs to be done to rediscover the short message service. The proposed method in this study is Boyer-Moore algorithm for searching string matching. An auto finds feature is designed to rediscover the short message service by searching using a particular pattern to rematch a text with the result of the hex value conversion in the database file. The system will redisplay the message for each of a match. From all the testing results, the proposed method has quite a high accuracy in rediscovering the short message service using the used dataset.

Currently, the traditional powder dusting method has low resolution, sensitivity, contrast and high background noise. To solve these problems, we synthesized the Ce3+ doped strontium phosphate phosphors (Sr10(PO4)6O:xCe3+, x = 0.01–0.1 mol) with cyan color by a facile solid state reaction route. The X-ray diffraction patterns of Sr10(PO4)6O:xCe3+ phosphors confirmed the hexagonal phase. The emission peak centered at 472 nm is attributed to 5D3/2 → 7FJ transitions (J = 7/2 and 5/2) of Ce3+ ions with the CIE coordinates value of (x = 0.171, y = 0.256). Using Sr10(PO4)6O:Ce3+ phosphors, the latent fingerprints with various ridge shapes (arch, whorl and loop) and on substrates (glass, aluminum foil, stainless steel, compact disk and credit card) exhibited excellent visualization and sensitivity with clear ridges under 254 nm UV illumination.

They undermine the normal telecommunications order, endanger public safety, seriously infringe the property rights of the masses, and violate citizen privacy. How to dig out the spatio-temporal patterns of the pseudo base stations'activities from massive spam messages, design effective prevention and control programs, and fight against the crime from the source, has become the focus of government agencies and researchers. The traditional methods for identifying pseudo base stations through the user terminal, however, face great challenges in terms of accuracy, comprehensiveness, and analytical ability, which no longer meet the requirements of identifying small-scale and mobile pseudo base stations. Utilizing data on the spam messages from February 23rd, 2017 to April 26th, 2017 in Beijing, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of pseudo base stations through non-negative matrix factorization. We also constructed a classification model through TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) which compares types from different classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors / K-Support Vector Machine / Random Forest/ Single- Layer Neural Network) and selects the most accurate random forest classification method. Combined with the land use data, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution of pseudo base stations that send different types of spam messages. The results of non-negative matrix factorization and spam message classification were analyzed in detail. The results show that most of the spam messages in Beijing are sent along the road network and in the central city. The number of spam messages during the day is much more than that during the evening. As time goes by in the day, the distribution of spam messages along the road network gradually shrinks inward. The pseudo base stations that send different types of spam messages differ in the spatio-temporal distribution, but all of them favor the traffic facilities and residential area within the Fourth Ring. The non-negative matrix factorization, which provides reliable results that match with traditional spam message classification, has shown simplicity in performing the analysis and interpretability in the form and result of the decomposition. It can help understand the spatio- temporal patterns of different types of spam messages and provide evident-based suggestions for government agencies to fight against the pseudo base stations effectively. By targeting the source of the spam messages, it is also beneficial for governments to combat the illegal behaviors based on pseudo base stations. © 2018, Science Press.

Consequently, with the advantage of numerous Android apps, Android malware seizes the opportunity to steal privacy-sensitive data by pretending to provide functionalities as benign apps do. To distinguish malware from millions of Android apps, researchers have proposed sophisticated static and dynamic analysis tools to automatically detect and classify malicious apps. Most of these tools, however, rely on manual configuration of lists of features based on permissions, sensitive resources, intents, etc., which are difficult to come by. To address this problem, we study real-world Android apps to mine hidden patterns of malware and are able to extract highly sensitive APIs that are widely used in Android malware. We also implement an automated malware detection system, MalPat, to fight against malware and assist Android app marketplaces to address unknown malicious apps. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on our dataset consisting of 31 185 benign apps and 15 336 malware samples.

To address this problem, we contribute an advert reporting system which utilizes opportunistic networking and a blockchain-inspired construction in order to identify authentic Ad-Reports by determining whether they were composed by honest or dishonest users. What constitutes a user's honesty for our system is the manner in which they access adverts on their mobile device. Dishonest users submit multiple reports over a short period of time while honest users behave as consumers who view adverts at a balanced pace while engaging in typical social activities such as purchasing goods online, moving through space and interacting with other users. We argue that it is hard for dishonest users to fake honest behaviour and we exploit the behavioural patterns of users in order to classify Ad-Reports as real or fabricated. By determining the honesty of the user who submitted a particular report, our system offers a more secure reward-claiming model which protects against fraud while still preserving the user's anonymity. © 2017 by the authors.","Advertising; Click report; Fraud prevention; Mobile networks; Privacy-preserving advertising","Data privacy; Marketing; Mobile devices; Wireless networks; Click report; Digital platforms; Distribution systems; Fraud prevention; Opportunistic networking; Privacy preserving; Reporting systems; Social activities; Crime","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034571329"

Given the high amount of sensitive data and operations related to these tasks, securing the mobile devices is becoming a very critical issue. As matter of the fact, malware attacks are on the rise and new mobile malware are continually generated with the aim of stealing private data and performing illegal activities. Since this new malware is mainly obtained by reusing existing malicious code, malware detection is supported by the study and the tracking of the mobile malware phylogeny. This paper proposes a malware phylogeny model obtained by a declarative Process Mining (PM) approach from the analysis of some running malware applications. The main idea is that the set of relations and recurring execution patterns among the syscalls of a running malware application can be modeled to obtain a malware fingerprint. The malware fingerprints are compared and classified by using a fuzzy clustering algorithm to recover the malware phylogeny map of all the considered malware families. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed on a dataset of more than 4,000 infected applications across 39 malware families obtaining very encouraging results. © 2018 IEEE.","","Biology; Clustering algorithms; Computer crime; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Web services; Critical issues; Illegal activities; Malicious codes; Malware attacks; Malware detection; Malware families; Process mining; Sensitive datas; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060436490"

Several techniques are proposed which use static and/or dynamic features extracted from android application to detect malware. The use of machine learning is adapted in various malware detection techniques to overcome the mannual updation overhead. Machine learning classifiers are widely used to model Android malware patterns based on their static features and dynamic behaviour. To address the problem of malware detection, in this paper we have proposed a machine learning-based malware detection system for Android platform. Our proposed system utilizes the features of collected random samples of goodware and malware apps to train the classifiers. The system extracts requested permissions, vulnerable API calls along with the existence of app's key information such as; dynamic code, reflection code, native code, cryptographic code and database from applications, which was missing in previous proposed solutions and uses them as features in various machine learning classifiers to build classification model. To validate the performance of proposed system, 'RanDroid' various experiments have been carriedout, which show that the RanDroid is capable to achieve a high classification accuracy of 97.7 percent. © 2018 IEEE.","Android Mobile Security; Machine Learning; Malware Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Energy security; Learning systems; Malware; Smart city; Android applications; Android platforms; Classification accuracy; Classification models; Cryptographic codes; Dynamic behaviours; Malware analysis; Malware detection; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049904647"

Online apps markets, despite their vetting procedures, still admit malicious apps that could be downloaded mistakenly by mobile users. Detecting Android malwares has been studied by many researchers using different approaches and techniques. The vast majority of them though were focused on using the requested permissions that are declared in the AndroidManifest. xml files. A number of researchers have considered other components of the Android applications besides the permissions such as package info, activities, and process name. Some researchers pointed out Android Broadcast receivers' component but it was not discussed thoroughly like other components. In this paper, we are conducting an empirical study to investigate the usage patterns of the Broadcast receivers component by malicious and benign Android applications. In addition to processing the AndroidManifest. xml files, the source code of malware samples, in particular the onReceive() are manually analyzed. We also propose a data mining malware detection mechanism based on the statically registered Broadcast receivers. Our research shows that Android Broadcast receivers are intensively used by malware compared to benign applications. Our Java code analysis shows that malware samples fully utilize Broadcast receivers compared to benign apps. Finally, our experiments showed that using the Broadcast receivers with permissions improves the malwares prediction accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.","Android; apps; Broadcast; malware; market; permissions; privacy","Application programs; Broadcasting; Commerce; Computer crime; Data mining; Data privacy; Malware; Marketing; Signal receivers; Android; Android applications; Broadcast receivers; Empirical studies; Java code analysis; Malware detection; permissions; Prediction accuracy; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046663200"

We investigated parental income trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks of self-harm and violent criminality in young adulthood. Methods: Using Danish national registers, we delineated a nested case-control study of Danish citizens born from Jan 1, 1982, to Dec 31, 2000, with first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and first violent crime convictions at ages 15–33 years. Each case was matched on age and gender to 25 randomly selected controls. Parental income was assessed in birth-year and at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. We considered parental age, the child's number of siblings, parental mental health, and parental education to be covariates. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by conditional logistic regression inherently adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year; we then made additional adjustments for the covariates considered. Findings: We identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-harm, to which we matched 531 675 controls, and 23 724 first violent crime convictions, to which we matched 593 100 controls. We observed inverse relationships between parental income and risks for the two outcomes for each of the ages parental income was measured. The longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, the higher their subsequent risks for self-harm and violent criminality, and vice versa for time spent living in affluent conditions. Associations were stronger for violent criminality than for self-harm. Compared with individuals who were born and remained in the most affluent families, all other income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for both outcomes. Those who remained in the least affluent quintile showed the highest risks for self-harm (IRR 7·2, 95% CI 6·6–7·9; 1174 [6%] cases) and for violent criminality (IRR 13·0; 95% CI 11·9–14·1; 1640 [7%] cases). The risk patterns were attenuated, but essentially persisted, after covariate adjustment. For any parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated with lower risk compared with downward mobility. Interpretation: Parental income represents a multitude of unmeasured familial sociodemographic indices. Tackling the causes of inequality and associated psychosocial and sociocultural challenges to enable upwards socioeconomic mobility could potentially reduce risks for self-directed and externalised violence.

In this paper, we presented a novel framework of profiling the secure chat and voice/ video calling apps which can be employed to extract hidden patterns about the app, information of involved parties, activities of chatting, voice/ video calls, status indications and notifications while having no information of communication protocol of the app and its security architecture.

We carried out two surveys of employment agencies during 2010–2011. Our findings suggest that there has been a profound change in settlement patterns of low-skilled immigrants: moving away from traditional Chinatowns in major American cities toward non-gateway destinations and rural areas. These new settlement locations are characterized by a low unemployment rate and low crime rate. Contrary to predictions from ethnic economy and mainstream economic perspectives, Chinese restaurant jobs tend not to be in places with a high concentration of Chinese immigrants, but rather in places with a high proportion of non-Hispanic whites. In addition, the farther the jobs are from New York City, the higher the salary. We discuss the implications of this fundamental change for re-conceptualizing the immigrant labor market and immigrant socioeconomic mobility in American society. © The Author(s) 2018.

These include the neighborhood-effects approach developed by the Chicago school of sociology in the 1920s; modern environmental criminology that explains the geographic distribution of crime; the criminology of place, which focuses on crime rates at specific places over time; and a newer approach that attends to the perception of crime and disorder in communities. Aided by new mobile and digital technologies as well as improved data reporting in recent decades, research in environmental criminology has developed at a rapid pace within each of these approaches. Despite these advances, research in the subfield of environmental criminology remains fragmented, and competing theories are often kept apart. This book takes a different approach and integrates the subfield as a whole. It covers the core theoretical and empirical issues of how and why the environment influences the emergence of crime and how crime can affect the environment. The chapters reflect the diversity in research and theory from all over the Western world. In addition to covering traditional criminological research, the book probes how well current theories of environmental criminology contribute to our understanding of new problems and how well theories travel to other areas, such as West Africa, in which cultural differences might lead to different patterns in offending. © Oxford University Press 2018.

User authentication for mobile payment has numerous approaches including face recognition, iris scan, and fingerprint scan to identify user's true identity by comparing the biometric features of users with patterns in the signature database. Existing studies on the face recognition problem focus mainly on the static analysis to determine the face recognition precision by examining the facial features of images with different facial expressions for users rather than the dynamic aspects where images were are often vague affected by lighting changes with different poses. Because the lighting, facial expressions, and facial details varied in the face recognition process. Consequently, it limits the effectiveness of scheme with which to determine the true identity. Accordingly, this study focused on a face recognition process under the situation of vague facial features using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach with convolutional neuron networks (CNNs) thru facial feature extraction, transformation, and comparison to determine the user identity for mobile payment. Specifically, the proposed authentication scheme uses back propagation algorithm to effectively improve the accuracy of face recognition using feed-forward network architecture for CNNs. Overall, the proposed scheme provided a higher precision of face recognition (100% at gamma correction γlocated in [0.5, 1.6]) compared with the average precision for face image (approximately 99.5% at normal lighting γ=1) of the existing CNN schemes with ImageNet 2012 Challenge training data set. © 2017 IEEE.","Back propagation; Convolutional neuron networks; Deep reinforcement learning; e-commerce; Face recognition","Authentication; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Commerce; Convolution; Deep learning; Electronic commerce; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Lighting; Network architecture; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Static analysis; Authentication scheme; E-commerce transactions; Facial feature extraction; Feed-forward network; Neuron networks; Recognition process; Reinforcement learning approach; User authentication; Face recognition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041637413"

Specifically, it looks at “the carrot” side of the theory, studying how thieves react to changes in monetary gains from crime. Methods: Using a unique crime-level dataset on metal theft in the Czech Republic, we study thieves’ behavior in a simple regression framework. We argue that variation in metal prices represents a quasi-experimental variation in gains from crime. It is because (1) people steal copper and other nonferrous metals only to sell them to scrapyard and (2) prices at scrapyards are set by the world market. This facilitates causal interpretation of our regression estimates. Results: We find that a 1% increase (decrease) in the re-sale price causes metal thefts to increase (decrease) by 1–1.5%. We show that the relationship between prices and thefts is very robust. Moreover, we find that thieves’ responses to price shocks are rapid and consistent. Conclusion: Our results are in line with the economic model of crime, wherein criminal behavior is modeled as a rational agent’s decision driven by the costs and benefits of undertaking criminal activities. Our estimates are also consistent with recent results from the United Kingdom, suggesting these patterns are more general. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Criminal opportunities; Economics of crime; Gains from crime; Metal theft; Rational choice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011693987"

This predominant platform has established itself not only in the mobile world but also in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This popularity, however, comes at the expense of security, as it has become a tempting target of malicious apps. Hence, there is an increasing need for sophisticated, automatic, and portable malware detection solutions. In this paper, we propose MalDozer, an automatic Android malware detection and family attribution framework that relies on sequences classification using deep learning techniques. Starting from the raw sequence of the app's API method calls, MalDozer automatically extracts and learns the malicious and the benign patterns from the actual samples to detect Android malware. MalDozer can serve as a ubiquitous malware detection system that is not only deployed on servers, but also on mobile and even IoT devices. We evaluate MalDozer on multiple Android malware datasets ranging from 1 K to 33 K malware apps, and 38 K benign apps. The results show that MalDozer can correctly detect malware and attribute them to their actual families with an F1-Score of 96%–99% and a false positive rate of 0.06%–2%, under all tested datasets and settings. © 2018 ElMouatez Billah Karbab, Mourad Debbabi, Abdelouahid Derhab, Djedjiga Mouheb","Android; Deep learning; IoT; Malware; Mobile","Computer crime; Deep learning; Global system for mobile communications; Internet of things; Malware; Android; Android malware; Android ossa; False positive rates; Internet of thing (IOT); Learning techniques; Malware detection; Mobile; Android (operating system)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045725282"

When we consider a huge network, we have to process a large amount of network information generated, which consists of both normal and abnormal activity logs in large volume of multi-dimensional data. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to monitor the network and to detect the malicious nodes and activities in the network. Massive amount of data makes it difficult to detect threats and attacks. Sequential Pattern mining may be used to identify the patterns of malicious activities which have been an emerging popular trend due to the consideration of quantities, profits and time orders of item. Here we propose a sequential pattern mining algorithm with fuzzy logic feature selection and fuzzy weighted support for huge volumes of network logs to be implemented in Apache Hadoop YARN, which solves the problem of speed and time constraints. Fuzzy logic feature selection selects important features from the feature set. Fuzzy weighted supports provide weights to the inputs and avoid multiple scans.

Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with prevention strategies, and crime prediction purposes, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents an agent-based model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure and location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as proxy for human activity. 18 mobility strategies have been tested, combining search distance strategies (e.g. Levy flight, inspired by insights in human dynamics literature) and destination selection strategies (enriched with Foursquare data). We analyze and compare the different mobility strategies, and show the impact of using activity nodes extracted from social networks to simulate offender mobility. This agent-based model provides a basis for comparing offender mobility in crime simulations by inferring offender mobility in urban areas from real world data. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Researchers in the United States and abroad have found that victims often choose not to mobilize the criminal law in the aftermath of a victimization event. A large percentage of property and violent crimes never appear in official crime data estimates. Most remain hidden in the dark figure of crime. Victim nonreporting has numerous implications for criminal justice system processing, crime control policy, and substantive research on the causes and correlates of crime. Studies have long sought to identify the victim-, incident-, and community-based mechanisms that might account for patterns of police notification.

Problematic Mobile Phone Use (PMPU) has been studied in relation to public health and comprises various behaviours, including dangerous, prohibited, and dependent use. These types of problematic mobile phone behaviours are typically assessed with the short version of the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire (PMPUQ–SV). However, to date, no study has ever examined the degree to which the PMPU scale assesses the same construct across different languages. The aims of the present study were to (i) determine an optimal factor structure for the PMPUQ–SV among university populations using eight versions of the scale (i.e., French, German, Hungarian, English, Finnish, Italian, Polish, and Spanish); and (ii) simultaneously examine the measurement invariance (MI) of the PMPUQ–SV across all languages. The whole study sample comprised 3038 participants. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were extracted from the demographic and PMPUQ-SV items. Individual and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses alongside MI analyses were conducted. Results showed a similar pattern of PMPU across the translated scales. A three-factor model of the PMPUQ-SV fitted the data well and presented with good psychometric properties. Six languages were validated independently, and five were compared via measurement invariance for future cross-cultural comparisons. The present paper contributes to the assessment of problematic mobile phone use because it is the first study to provide a cross-cultural psychometric analysis of the PMPUQ-SV. © 2018 by the authors.

Permissions and Network Traffic are the widely used detection attributes. Malicious apps download malware at run-time and evade static permissions based detection while they can be detected by the network traffic. The malware that do not require network connectivity evade network traffic based detection which can be detected by permissions analysis. Therefore, we believe that combining the network traffic and system permissions will enhance the detection rate. Hence, in this work, we combine both the attributes and propose a hybrid detection model named NTPDroid, that extracts Network Traffic features and Permissions from the applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards combining these important sources of Android malware detection. We train and test the proposed model using the FP-Growth algorithm to generate the frequent patterns consisting of traffic features and permissions. Experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 94.25%, better than frequent patterns obtained independently. © 2018 IEEE.","Android Malware; Frequent Patterns; Hybrid Detection; Mobile Security; Network Traffic Analysis; Permissions","Android (operating system); Big data; Computer crime; Computer networks; Data privacy; Malware; Mobile security; Pattern recognition; Android malware; Frequent Patterns; Hybrid detection; Network traffic analysis; Permissions; Network security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054090784"

An important component of such malware is the command and control channel, which enables the malware to respond to controller commands. The detection of malware command and control channels could help prevent further malicious activity by cyber criminals using the malware. Detection of malware in network traffic is traditionally carried out by identifying specific patterns in packet payloads. Now bot writers encrypt the command and control payloads, making pattern recognition a less effective form of detection. This paper focuses instead on an effective anomaly based detection technique for bot and advanced persistent threats using a data mining approach combined with applied classification algorithms. After additional tuning, the final test on an unseen dataset, false positive rates of 0% with malware detection rates of 100% were achieved on two examined malware threats, with promising results on a number of other threats. © 2017 IEEE.","advanced persistent threat; anomaly based detection; botnet; command and control; data mining; malware","Botnet; Data mining; Mobile telecommunication systems; Pattern recognition; Statistical tests; advanced persistent threat; Anomaly based detection; Classification algorithm; Command and control; False positive rates; Malicious activities; Malware detection; Network administrator; Malware","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046014859"

Although today's mobile operating systems do their best to provide users with a secure Internet environment, due to the open source nature of Android, it is still unable to completely stop the outbreak of Android malware. Although existing source-based static detection and behavior-based dynamic detection can identify mobile malware, many problems still exist,such as low detection efficiency and difficulty in deployment. In order to solve these problems, we propose DroidDetector, a detection engine that can automatically detect whether an app is a malware or not by using off-line trained machine learning models for network traffic analysis. DroidDetector uses the VPNService class provided by the Android SDK to intercept network traffic (it does not require root permission). All data analysis are performed on the server,which consumes minimun cache and resource on mobile devices. We extract the length of the first 8 packets of network traffic as features and use Support Vector Machine(SVM) classification algorithm to train the model. In an evaluation experiment of 53107 TCP packet length feature tuples samples, DroidDetector can achieve 95. 68% detection confidence. © 2018 SPIE.","Android; Detection; Machine learning; Malware; Network Traffic","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Error detection; Learning systems; Malware; Open systems; Pattern recognition; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Android; Classification algorithm; Evaluation experiments; Internet environment; Machine learning models; Mobile operating systems; Network traffic; Network traffic analysis; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052392556"

We gathered the cyber security alerts shared within the SABU platform, in which around 220,000 alerts from heterogeneous geographically distributed sensors (intrusion detection systems and honeypots) are shared every day. Subsequently, we used the methods of sequential rule mining to identify common attack patterns and to derive rules for predicting attacks. As we illustrate in this paper, a collaborative environment allows attack prediction in multiple dimensions. First, we can predict what will the attacker do next and when. Second, we can predict where will the attack hit, e.g., when an attacker is targeting several networks at once. In a weeklong experiment, we processed in total over 1 million alerts, from which we mined predictive rules every day. Our findings show that most of the rules display stable values of support and confidence and, thus, can be used to predict cyber attacks in consecutive days after mining without a need to actualize the rules every day. © 2018 IEEE.","Attack prediction; Collaborative security; Data mining; Information exchange","Computer crime; Crime; Forecasting; Information dissemination; Intrusion detection; Mobile computing; Network security; Wireless telecommunication systems; Attack prediction; Collaborative environments; Collaborative securities; Empirical evaluations; Information exchanges; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multiple dimensions; Support and confidence; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053911722"

This study investigates what items are important for the purchase of mobile phones in various and rapidly changing mobile phone markets from the consumer's point of view and tries to make a strategic suggestion for future mobile distribution strategies. Research design, data, and methodology - The procedure of this study takes place in four steps. In step 1, only the SF type respondents selected for this study were extracted through MBTI analysis. In step 2, they were divided into three hierarchies for the AHP analysis and each element was arranged. In step 3, the AHP analysis was converted to a Fuzzy-AHP number using the trigonometric centroid method. This was to eliminate the ambiguity of the response by converting into a fuzzy number even if data consistency was maintained with CI value below 0.1. In step 4, the number of converted 2-layer and 3-layer was combined to derive the priority when the final handset is selected. Results - First, the highest importance among the four items in the second tier was the terminal function item, followed by brand, price, and design item. Second, in the third tier, the highest importance was level of after-sales service, followed by device price, processing speed, ease of use, usefulness, and rate system. Third, the arithmetic average of the determinant of the fuzzy function showed that processing speed, ease of use and usefulness in the function item, level of after-sales service in the brand item, and device price in the price item were the five most important factors among 16 choice factors. Conclusions - First, there will be a change in the consumption patterns of consumers who have compared distributors and dealers to purchase handsets with more subsidies. Second, it is highly likely that people will purchase new handsets only when they need to change their devices because they can not receive subsidies by switching phone brands any more. © 2018 Journal of Distribution Science.","Customer attitudes; Fuzzy-AHP analysis; SmartPhone distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051064929"

The article aims to show how the state ensemble not only removes legal protection for communal tenure but also mobilizes legal as well as illegal means to force the change of communal lands into private property. Beyond that, the article also aims to show how these changes in land tenure regulation intersect with the Mexican war on Drugs. © 2018 Pluto Journals.All right reserved.","Coloniality; Enclosures; Land tenure; Mexico; State crime; War on Drugs","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062187224"

However, once these identity data are stolen, traditional information security methods will not avoid online transaction fraud. The existing convolutional neural network model for fraud detection needs to generate many derivative features. This paper proposes a fraud detection model based on the convolutional neural network in the field of online transactions, which constructs an input feature sequencing layer that implements the reorganization of raw transaction features to form different convolutional patterns. Its significance is that different feature combinations entering the convolution kernel will produce different derivative features. The advantage of this model lies in taking low dimensional and nonderivative online transaction data as the input. The whole network consists of a feature sequencing layer, four convolutional layers and pooling layers, and a fully connected layer. Verifying with online transaction data from a commercial bank, the experimental results show that the model achieves excellent fraud detection performance without derivative features. And its precision can be stabilized at around 91% and recall can be stabilized at around 94%, which increased by 26% and 2%, respectively, comparing with the existing CNN for fraud detection. © 2018 Zhaohui Zhang et al.","","Convolution; Crime; Neural networks; Security of data; Convolution kernel; Convolutional neural network; Feature combination; Fully-connected layers; Internet transaction; Model-based OPC; Online transaction; Wireless mobile terminals; Feature extraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053032433"

If an examiner fails to recognize the pertinence of an item on scene, the analyst's theory regarding the crime will be limited. Conversely, unselective evidence collection will most likely include irrelevant material, thus increasing a forensic laboratory's backlog and potentially sending the investigation into an unproductive and costly direction. Therefore, it is critical that analysts recognize and properly evaluate forensic evidence that can assess the relative support of differing hypotheses related to event reconstruction. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to determine if quantitative eye tracking data and qualitative reconstruction accuracy could be used to distinguish investigator expertise. In order to assess this, 32 participants were successfully recruited and categorized as experts or trained novices based on their practical experiences and educational backgrounds. Each volunteer then processed a mock crime scene while wearing a mobile eye tracker, wherein visual fixations, durations, search patterns, and reconstruction accuracy were evaluated. The eye tracking data (dwell time and task percentage on areas of interest or AOIs) were compared using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Needleman–Wunsch (N–W) algorithm, revealing significant group differences for both search duration (EMD), as well as search sequence (N–W). More specifically, experts exhibited greater dissimilarity in search duration, but greater similarity in search sequences than their novice counterparts. In addition to the quantitative visual assessment of examiner variability, each participant's reconstruction skill was assessed using a 22-point binary scoring system, in which significant group differences were detected as a function of total reconstruction accuracy. This result, coupled with the fact that the study failed to detect a significant difference between the groups when evaluating the total time needed to complete the investigation, indicates that experts are more efficient and effective. Finally, the results presented here provide a basis for continued research in the use of eye trackers to assess expertise in complex and distributed environments, including suggestions for future work, and cautions regarding the degree to which visual attention can infer cognitive understanding. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crime scene investigation; Expertise; Eye tracking; Interpretation of evidence; Significance of evidence","Attention; Cognition; Crime; Discriminant Analysis; Fixation, Ocular; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Professional Competence; Visual Perception; accuracy; algorithm; Article; crime; earth movers distance; expert witness; eye tracking; female; forensic identification; gaze; human; hypothesis; intermethod comparison; legal evidence; male; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sensory analysis; statistical analysis; statistical significance; visual attention; attention; cognition; discriminant analysis; eye fixation; forensic science; procedures; professional competence; vision","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029912117"

The basic methods and approaches (e.g. analysis of individual events, control of the integrity of data flows and analysis of subscriber behavior profiles) to detect and prevent fraud have been reviewed in this publication. The key challenge of fraud counteraction systems and solutions is that information about subscribers is allocated in different systems that might lead to the problem of data synchronization. Fraud detection and prevention approaches, which represent the creation of a single centralized system for managing fraud, are described in the article. The major purpose is to identify the intruders by analyzing an aggregated data from the adjacent anti-fraud systems. This approach, based on the experiences of a number of anti-fraud systems, allows setting rules and patterns to prevent intruders.

As technologies became democratized and societies got equipped with a plethora of high-potential technologies with which to access the Cyber-Space at any time, communication and action patterns would thoroughly change and alter our spheres of professional and private life, agenda setting, political participation, and behavioral patterns. While security issues are being put on the back burner, cyber-rebels and cyber-criminals grow in numbers. New risks and challenges ensue from this. Therefore, this chapter assesses potential advantages and risks of the Cyber-Space in terms of Cyber-Democracy and Cyber-Crime, inclusive of the latest trend of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD). It illustrates that cyber-democratic action and participation are wide concepts that extend beyond classical definitions of democratic participation and emphasizes the importance of bottom-up mobilization and agenda-setting. At the same time, it underlines how freedom of expression and Cyber-Crime interact by using the example of hacktivism and the hacker movement Anonymous. Even if technological (device management) methods and strategies may help cope with these challenges, they are not an entirely technical issue. This is illustrated by the trend of Bring-Your-Own-Device, where issues at stake also concern legal questions as well as psychological ones (awareness, negligence, and willingness to face existing challenges). Therefore, this chapter also pays attention to the manifold legal issues which have been unsolved so far and urges for legal measures to fill the existing gaps and loopholes pointed to. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Anonymous; Bring your own device (BYOD); Cloud computing; CoIT; Consumerization of IT; Cyber-crime; Cyber-democracy; Cyber-governance; Data protection; Knowledge worker; Pirate party movement; Private cloud; Public cloud; Wikileaks; Workplace democracy","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029168189"

Recent practical studies and Rational Choice Theory suggest that the crime suspect mobility is predictable. The previous approaches for suspect location prediction focused on the forecasting the spatial likelihood of anchor point (i.e. the residential or future offending place) for a suspect who committed a series of crimes. However, the monitoring data are usually poor in availability for tracking suspects. Thus, the existing methodologies failed to capture the complex social location transition patterns for suspects and lacked the capacity to address the mobility data scarcity issue. Therefore, it is intractable to reflect suspects mobility patterns from sparse monitoring data, which reduces the effectiveness of case analysis and crime risk prediction. To address this challenge, we presented a novel Crime Records enhanced Location Prediction (CReLP) model. By merging the historical crime cases information by a collaborative filtering process, the CReLP model the estimate the visiting intensity at any arbitrary spatiotemporal node for and individual suspect. Particularly, we first obtained basic spatial and temporal units by partitioning the target areas into 100×100 2D grids and segmenting the daytime into 24 time bins. Second, we built a 3D tensor to model the social mobilities of all suspects with each entry in it representing the visiting intensity at each location and each time bin for each suspect. Meanwhile, this approach employed two matrices to express general movement trends among all suspects. Third, we created a suspect-correlation matrix relying on the spatial and temporal proximities of their historical crime events, as well as the similarities between their personal properties. At last, the missing entries in the 3D tensor were filled through the joint decomposition across all tensors and matrices mentioned above. This way were able to uncover the spatial distribution pattern for each suspect at any time. We evaluated the CReLP model using a real-world suspect mobility dataset collected from 241 suspects over 6 months with about 19 thousand location records. The results showed that our model outperformed three baseline approaches by 32% to 63% at RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and 14% to 26% in TMSD (Top- k Minimum Search Distance), respectively. Finally, a suspect's visiting spatial distributions of the ground truth and predicting results between 8 to 12 a.m. were illustrated to show the performance of our proposed model. © 2018, Science Press.

The main goal is to prevent the installation of the malicious software on the victim systems. The approach focuses on identifying malware addressed against the Android platform. For that purpose, only the system calls performed during the boot process of the recently installed applications are studied. Thereby the amount of information to be considered is reduced, since only activities related with their initialization are taken into account. The proposal defines a pattern recognition system with three processing layers: monitoring, analysis and decision-making. First, in order to extract the sequences of system calls, the potentially compromised applications are executed on a safe and isolated environment. Then the analysis step generates the metrics required for decision-making. This level combines sequence alignment algorithms with bagging, which allow scoring the similarity between the extracted sequences considering their regions of greatest resemblance. At the decision-making stage, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is implemented, which determines if the new software is labeled as legitimate or malicious. The proposal has been tested in different experiments that include an in-depth study of a particular use case, and the evaluation of its effectiveness when analyzing samples of well-known public datasets. Promising experimental results have been shown, hence demonstrating that the approach is a good complement to the strategies of the bibliography. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anomalies; Intrusion detection; Malware; Mobile devices; Pattern recognition; Sequence alignment","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Decision making; Intrusion detection; Malware; Mobile devices; Pattern recognition; Software testing; Amount of information; Android platforms; Anomalies; Dynamic behaviors; Malware detection; Processing layer; Sequence alignments; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Pattern recognition systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044255432"

The security measures taken by the organization are being circumvented by the attackers. Data analysis of the past attacks can help us in understanding the patterns and trends in cybersecurity breaches. This way, organizations can come up with more flexible and cost-effective security measures. However, the analysis of past security breaches is challenging as there are no proper repositories that contain the information required for concluding or predicting trends of attacks. Also, the cyber attacks have become very common and a new attack is reported on a daily basis. Hence, dynamic analysis of data will yield better results than the conventional way of data analysis. In this paper, we present the prototype of a tool that can extract and structure information using the public data available on the Internet containing information regarding the cyber attacks that have taken place all around the world. Using this collected data we can analyze and predict trends in the cyber breaches. We envision that the obtained results from the analysis can help organizations in deriving new proactive and effective security measures.

Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times. Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models. Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before.

On the other hand, SNA are also used for malicious activities. Identifying the physical person behind a SNA account is a challenge task in investigations of SNA-involved criminal cases. As one way to address this challenge, automatic user attribute inference, which is also referred to as user profiling, has become an increasingly attractive research topic. However, existing methods may suffer from problems such as low quality content and complex social networks. The increasing amounts of user-generated geolocation data on SNA give rise to new opportunities for user profiling. In this paper, we study the problem of user profiling with user-generated geolocation data. Specifically, we take occupation profiling as an entry point. We design a supervised occupation classification framework and propose two categories of geolocation-based features, i.e., mobility pattern features (MPF) and location preference features (LPF). Experiments performed using real-world SNA data reveal that LPF can indicate the occupation to a certain extent and are more efficient than word count features and TF-IDF features. Moreover, it is also revealed that good occupation profiling accuracy can be achieved by integrating LPF and LDA topic features inferred from text content. © 2017 IEEE.","location preference; mobility pattern; occupation inference; social media; user profiling","Knowledge engineering; Classification framework; Complex social networks; Malicious activities; Mobility pattern; occupation inference; Social media; Social networking application (SNA); User profiling; Employment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046447035"

Children resemble their parents in a variety of life outcomes such as socioeconomic status, family formation characteristics, and political views. There is growing evidence that some families - despite interventions by child protection services, judicial sanctions, and social mobility - are stuck in patterns of criminal behaviour, poverty, substance abuse, teenage parenthood, and other negative life events. This is a growing global problem for which currently no solution is available. This book brings together the most important and unique findings of intergenerational studies of criminal behaviour from around the world, and from a variety of disciplines, from criminology to sociology to anthropology. Each chapter explores the historical background of a specific study, its most important objectives, and the unique conclusions and implications that can be drawn from the data. Essential reading for all those interested in criminal behaviour, psychological criminology, and intergenerational psychology, this book provides an extensive overview of intergenerational studies on patterns of continuity and discontinuity of criminal, antisocial, or delinquent behaviour, as well as related behaviours or risk factors such as the intergenerational continuities in (harsh) parenting and family relationship quality. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Veroni I.

Many event detection systems using geo-tagged posts from social networks have been developed in recent years. Besides detecting real-world events, it is also desirable for government officials, news media, and police, etc., to identify on-site users of an event, from whom we could gather valuable information regarding the process of events and investigate suspects when an event is associated with crime or terrorist. However, due to the high uncertainty of human mobility patterns and the low probability of users sharing their location information, it is difficult to identify on-site users while a social event unfolds, and research work in this area is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a Fused fEature Gaussian prOcess Regression (FEGOR) model, which exploits three influential factors in social networks for on-site user identification: mobility influence, content similarity, and social relationship. By integrating these factors, we are able to estimate the distance between a user and a social event even when the user's location profile is unknown, thus identify on-site users. Experiments on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving a minimum mean absolute error of 1.7km and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","content similarity; Gaussian process regression; mobility influence; On-site user; social relationship; user-social event distance","Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Location; Social aspects; Telecommunication services; Content similarity; Gaussian process regression; On-site User; Social events; Social relationships; Location based services","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040912418"

Based on the results, the quantification of, equipment wise, e-waste generation and their distinctive disposal patterns were acquired. Future, e-waste generation was also estimated using an approach investigated by Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit and Manufacturer’s Association of Information Technology (GTZ-MAIT). The total amount of e-waste generation from households of Chandigarh was found out to be 3276.47 tons/annum, which was equivalent to 3.1 kg/capita/annum. It was also found that most of the e-waste generated was from the use of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) such as Mobile phones, Laptops, Cameras, Washing machines, Air conditioners, Heaters, Geysers, LEDs and LCDs. Moreover, taking the annual GDP growth rate of India into account e-waste generation from households was estimated to reach 9565.1 tons/annum by 2020. Among the various disposal channels “selling as scrap” was the most favored one among the respondents to discard the used EEE. Therefore, it can be concluded from the survey that informal sectors or scrap dealers are very active in e-waste collection as they are aware about the profitability from its dismantling and recycling. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Disposal channel; E-waste management; Electrical and electronic equipment; Quantification; Recycling; Survey","Air conditioning; Economics; Heating; Oscillators (electronic); Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Surveying; Surveys; Waste disposal; Wastes; E-waste generations; Electrical and electronic equipment; Future predictions; Informal sector; Quantification; Scrap dealers; Socio-economics; Waste collection; Electronic Waste","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044460570"

Drawing on two months of qualitative fieldwork, findings suggest that social and political mobilisation enabled a political coalition to initiate substantial changes under the Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life) public-security programme, which improved the legitimacy and operational effectiveness of the criminal justice system, and coincided with a marked reduction in homicide rates. While showing that these reforms were central in reducing lethal violence in Pernambuco between 2007 and 2013, the article concludes by discussing the challenges of policy continuity in light of increasing rates of lethal violence since 2014.

To detect mobile malware, static approaches and dynamic approaches are two common ways used to analyze suspicious applications. Dynamic approaches detect malware base on the actual behaviors of applications, but how to trigger malicious behavior and the efficient of dynamic approaches are the difficulties of this kind of approaches. Due to the limited resource of mobile devices, static analysis approach is the practicable way to detect malwares on mobile device. Anti-virus software is the typical paradigm of static analysis approach. However, the effectiveness of Anti-virus software rely on its signatures. How to find an efficient and automatic way to build thread pattern of mobile malware is a critical issue to detect new or zero-day malware.

It investigates how insecurity resulting from criminal-related activities and the concomitant reaction on the part of the Mexican state and self-defense groups has forcibly displaced thousands of people, critically reshaping the state's migration patterns, such as with the rise of internal displacement. Relying on interviews with migrant authorities and representatives of civil society both in Mexico and the United States, this chapter traces the effect that violence is having on traditional migration patterns showing how an important number of uprooted Michoacanos have attempted to migrate north using existing transnational migration networks.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm on AD (Absolute Deviation) of statistical approach to avoid and prevent Wormhole attack. Absolute deviation covariance and correlation take less time to detect Wormhole attack than classical one. Any extra necessary conditions, like GPS are not needed in proposed algorithms. From origin to destination, a fake tunnel is created by wormhole attackers, which is a link with good amount of frequency level. A false idea is created by this, that the source and destination of the path are very nearby each other and will take less time. But the original path takes more time. So it is necessary to calculate the time taken to avoid and prevent Wormhole attack. Better performance by absolute deviation technique than AODV is proved by simulation, done by MATLAB simulator for wormhole attack. Then the packet drop pattern is also measured for Wormholes using Absolute Deviation Correlation Coefficient. © 2018 IEEE.","absolute deviation; AD correlation; covariance; MANET; Wormhole attack","MATLAB; Mobile ad hoc networks; Absolute deviations; Correlation coefficient; covariance; MANET; Matlab simulators; Packet drops; Statistical approach; Wormhole attack; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047476436"

Along with other offenders such as pathogens, mutagens, xenobiotics, and pollutants, allergens can be grouped as inflammatory agents. Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are altered metabolism products of necrotic or stressed cells, which are deemed as alarm signals by the innate immune system. Like inflammation, DAMPs play a role in correcting the altered physiological state, but in excess, they can be lethal due to their signal transduction roles. In a vicious loop, inflammatory agents are DAMP generators and DAMPs create a pro-inflammatory state. Only a handful of DAMPs such as uric acid, mtDNA, extracellular ATP, HSPs, amyloid β, S100, HMGB1, and ECM proteins have been studied till now. A large number of DAMPs are still obscure, in need to be unveiled. The identification and functional characterization of those DAMPs in inflammation pathways can be insightful. Recent Findings: As inflammation and immune activation have been implicated in almost all pathologies, studies on them have been intensified in recent times. Consequently, the pathologic mechanisms of various DAMPs have emerged. Following PRR ligation, the activation of inflammasome, MAPK, and NF-kB is some of the common pathways. Summary: The limited number of recognized DAMPs are only a fraction of the vast array of other DAMPs. In fact, any misplaced or abnormal level of metabolite can be a DAMP. Sophisticated analysis studies can reveal the full profile of the DAMPs. Lowering the level of DAMPs is useful therapeutic intervention but certainly not as effective as avoiding the DAMP generators, i.e., the inflammatory agents. So, rather than mitigating DAMPs, efforts should be focused on the elimination of inflammatory agents. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","DAMPs; Immune system; Inflammation; Innate immunity","Alarmins; Animals; Humans; Inflammation; adenosine triphosphate; amyloid beta protein; biological factor; heat shock protein; high mobility group B1 protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; mitochondrial DNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein S 100; scleroprotein; uric acid; alarmin; human; inflammation; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein function; Review; signal transduction; animal; immunology; inflammation","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054149878"

Mobile tanks are prone to harsh conditions due to poor road networks in some countries which affect tanker truck alignment and suspension systems, and all these affects tank calibration accuracy. This is further aggravated by various road impacts, and accidents that sometimes distort portions of the tank shape making it to lose its cylindrical profile in some sections. Excessive stock variations is often linked to product theft and sabotage, though this may be true in some instances, but at times, this variations may be as a result of inaccuracies in tank calibration. The dataset presented in this paper contains tank calibration parameters for two consecutive calibrations carried out on the same mobile storage tank. The statistical analysis attempts to identify variations between the two tank calibration dataset as an indication of potential stock accuracy variations. © 2018 The Authors","Calibration accuracy; Data pattern recognition; Oil and fuel; Stock Accounting; Storage tank; Transportation","Crime; Digital storage; Fuel storage; Fuels; Pattern recognition; Roads and streets; Supply chains; Suspensions (components); Business productivity; Calibration accuracy; Data pattern recognition; Data patterns; Inventory management; Oil and fuel; Performance; Productivity analysis; Stock accounting; Storage tank; Calibration","Data paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049916190"

Large amounts of data collected from computer networks, servers, and mobile devices need to be analysed for malware proliferation. Effective analysis methods are needed to match with the scale and complexity of such a data-intensive environment. In today's Big Data contexts, visualisation techniques can support malware analysts going through the time-consuming process of analysing suspicious activities thoroughly. This paper takes a step further in contributing to the evolving realm of visualisation techniques used in the information security field. The aim of the paper is twofold: (1) to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing visualisation techniques for detecting suspicious behaviour of systems and (2) to design a novel visualisation using similarity matrix method for establishing malware classification accurately. The prime motivation of our proposal is to identify obfuscated malware using visualisation of the extended x86 IA-32 (opcode) similarity patterns, which are hard to detect with the existing approaches. Our approach uses hybrid models wherein static and dynamic malware analysis techniques are combined effectively along with visualisation of similarity matrices in order to detect and classify zero-day malware efficiently. Overall, the high accuracy of classification achieved with our proposed method can be visually observed since different malware families exhibit significantly dissimilar behaviour patterns. © 2018 Sitalakshmi Venkatraman and Mamoun Alazab.","","Computer crime; Data visualization; Internet of things; Matrix algebra; Security of data; Servers; Visualization; Dynamic malware analysis; Effective analysis; Efficient monitoring; Internet of Things (IOT); Large amounts of data; Malware classifications; Similarity patterns; Suspicious behaviours; Malware","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058885153"

By placing race at the centre of its analysis, this volume brings together fourteen essays that examine, question, and explain the growing intersection between criminal justice and migration control. Through the lens of race, we see how criminal justice and migration enmesh in order to exclude, stop, and excise racialized citizens and non-citizens from societies across the world within, beyond, and along borders. Neatly organized in four parts, the book begins with chapters that present a conceptual analysis of race, borders, and social control, moving to the institutions that make up and shape the criminal justice and migration complex. The remaining chapters are convened around the key sites where criminal justice and migration control intersect: policing, courts, and punishment. Together the volume presents a critical and timely analysis of how race shapes and complicates mobility and how racism is enabled and reanimated when criminal justice and migration control coalesce. Race and the meaning of race in relation to citizenship and belonging are excavated throughout the chapters presented in the book, thereby transforming the way we think about migration. © The several contributors 2017.","Borders; Citizenship; Criminal justice; Deportation; Detention; Law; Legal system; Migration; Policing; Race","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050442265"

This research visualises human mobility patterns using spatiotemporally GPS-rich traces collected from 24 participants during a pilot study of a new smartphone application—Wander. The results illustrate the utility of such data for capturing individuals’ multi-nodal activity spaces to better understand people–place interactions in the context of increasingly fluid and mobile lifestyles.

In the past, various research studies have tried to identify and classify the factors contributing towards the detection of phishing websites. The focus of this research is to establish a strong relationship between those identified heuristics (content-based) and the legitimacy of a website by analyzing training sets of websites (both phishing and legitimate websites) and in the process analyze new patterns and report findings. Many existing phishing detection tools are often not very accurate as they depend mostly on the old database of previously identified phishing websites. However, there are thousands of new phishing websites appearing every year targeting financial institutions, cloud storage/file hosting sites, government websites, and others. This paper presents a framework called Phishing-Detective that detects phishing websites based on existing and newly found heuristics. For this framework, a web crawler was developed to scrape the contents of phishing and legitimate websites. These contents were analyzed to rate the heuristics and their contribution scale factor towards the illegitimacy of a website. The data set collected from Web Scraper was then analyzed using a data mining tool to find patterns and report findings. A case study shows how this framework can be used to detect a phishing website. This research is still in progress but shows a new way of finding and using heuristics and the sum of their contributing weights to effectively and accurately detect phishing websites. Further development of this framework is discussed at the end of the paper. © 2017 IEEE.","heuristic weights; Phishing detection; web crawler","Computer crime; Data mining; Digital storage; Mobile telecommunication systems; Web crawler; Data-mining tools; Detection framework; Financial institution; Government websites; heuristic weights; Phishing detections; Phishing websites; Research studies; Websites","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045829810"

Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients' medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims. However, because of the complex granularity of medical data, existing fraud detection approaches tend to be less effective in terms of monitoring the healthcare services process. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with these problems. By means of the proposed SSIsomap activity clustering method, SimLOF outlier detection method, and the Dempster-Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method, our approach is able to detect unusual categories and frequencies of behaviors simultaneously. Our approach is applied to a real-world data set containing more than 40 million medical insurance claim activities from over 40 000 users. Compared with two state-of-the-art approaches, the extensive experimental results show that our approach is significantly more effective and efficient. Our approach agent which provides decision support for the approval sender during the medical insurance claim approval process is undergoing trial in mobile healthcare services. © 2013 IEEE.","Data mining; medical information systems; pattern analysis; semisupervised learning","Crime; Data mining; Decision support systems; Formal logic; Health care; Insurance; Medical computing; Statistics; Activity clustering; Aggregation methods; Dempster-Shafer theory; Healthcare services; Identification method; Pattern analysis; Real-time protection; Semi- supervised learning; Medical information systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054635813"

Researchers called for investigations into collective and cooperative uses of the technology. Responding to these calls, we explored Burmese fishers’ use of mobile phones in the realms of social life and business, mainly related to information seeking and sharing among the community. Interviews with 23 fishers in three regions in Myanmar suggested that both social and commercial, as well as individual- and community-oriented, uses were prevalent. Mobile phones helped channel information on price and market demand among a limited number of fishers, especially the boat owners and fish dealers. The other segments in the fishing labor hierarchy desisted from individual ownership of the phone, while opting for a more community-based appropriation. A nuanced picture of use and non-use of mobiles emerged alongside fishers’ socio-economic status and patterns of fishing. © The Author(s) 2017.","communities; fishers; fishing industry; livelihoods; mobile phones; Myanmar","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041594222"

Smart management of these services increases the necessity of dealing with big data which is come from different sources with various types and formats like 3D city information, GPS, traffic, mobile, Building Information Model (BIM), environmental, social activities and IoT stream data. Therefore, an approach to mine/analysis/interpret these data and extract useful knowledge from this diverse big data sources emerges in order to extract the hidden pattern of data using computational algorithms from statistics, machine learning and information theory. However, inconsistency, duplication and repetition and misconducting with the different type of discrete and continuous data can cause erroneous decision-making. This paper focuses on providing a rules extraction and supervised-decision making methods for facilitating the fusion of BIM and 2D and 3D GIS-based information coupling with IoT stream data residing in a spatial database and 3D BIM data. The proposed methods can be used in those applications like Emergency Response, Evacuation Planning, Occupancy Mapping, and Urban Monitoring to Smart Multi-Buildings so that their input data mostly come from 2D and 3D GIS, BIM and IoT stream.

In this review of international gang policy developments, we critically examine a number of these policies in a comparative context - including gang policing units and intelligence databases - and interrogate their efficacy. Drawing on cogent examples from the UK, we argue for caution in adopting US gang intervention tactics due to the lack of empirical evidence relating to their applicability or efficacy, and the corresponding potential for discrimination toward the most marginalised and socially excluded children and young people in society. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and National Children's Bureau","Europe; gang interventions; joint enterprise; policing; policy mobility; youth gangs","child; drawing; drug efficacy; Europe; European; female; gang; human; human experiment; intelligence; joint; juvenile; male; review","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041635837"

This pattern of arrests has been associated with a phenomenon referred to as the criminalization of mental illness such that people with mental illnesses are inappropriately diverted to the criminal justice system rather than to treatment. To decrease arrests of people with mental illnesses experiencing a crisis, pre-booking diversion programs have been developed to intervene at the point of police contact. This systematic literature review examines the state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs by addressing the question, “What is the evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in reducing arrests (i.e., reducing criminalization) of people with mental illnesses?” Methods Systematic literature searches of seven databases were performed during May 2017. The searches sought to identify studies that examined the effectiveness of pre-booking diversion programs in decreasing arrests. A multi-phase screening process was completed independently by two pairs of reviewers as well as a risk of bias review. Results A total of 2,750 unique citations were identified. Of these, 4 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria; all were from the US. Three of the studies examined the effectiveness of Crisis Intervention Teams and one study looked at a mobile crisis program. Two of the studies were at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk. Conclusions This review indicates that this line of inquiry is still developing. There are a number of gaps yet to be filled. The current evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in reducing arrests (i.e., reducing criminalization) of people with mental illnesses is limited. However, these studies indicate there is moderate evidence that these programs increase linkages to mental health services. © 2018 Dewa et al.

However, analyzing hybrid mobile apps' unique behaviors has been seldom addressed. In this paper, we explore the influence of native and web technologies integration in hybrid mobile apps on the generated profile of mobile applications. Specifically, we analyze the type of Security Sensitive APIs (SS-APIs) exposed to web content and identify the corresponding usage patterns by systematically tracking function-call-graphs of a large number of hybrid and native mobile apps. Our investigations indicate that the generated profiles for hybrid and native mobile apps are considerably different. Using our proposed tool, called Hybrid-scanner, for tracking and analyzing internal behaviors of hybrid mobile apps, we show that there is more trace of API calling for triggering a specific SS-API in a hybrid mobile app in comparison with Android native mobile apps. In addition, we have found that almost 40% of SS-APIs in hybrid mobile apps are invoked by third-party libraries, e.g. advertisement libraries. This knowledge, however, is crucial for designing appropriate malware detection or vulnerability mitigation strategies. Based on our results, we discuss two main approaches in Android malware analysis field and enumerate some suggestions which should be considered in order to successfully detect malicious behaviors in such new type of apps. © 2018 IEEE.","android mobile analysis; hybrid mobile apps; security analysis; web technology","Android (operating system); Big data; Computer crime; Data privacy; Integration; Libraries; Malware; Mobile computing; android mobile analysis; Malicious behavior; Mobile applications; Mobile apps; Security analysis; Security problems; Vulnerability mitigation; Web technologies; Mobile security","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054094424"

Kaspersky Labs detected and intercepted a total of 5,730,916 malicious installation packages in 2017. To curb this problem, researchers and various security laboratories have developed numerous malware analysis models. In Android based smartphones, permissions have been an inherent part of such models. Permission request patterns can be used to detect behavior of different applications. As applications with similar functionalities should use permission requests in similar ways, they can be used to distinguish different types of apps. However, when analysis models are trained on permission vectors extracted from a mixture of applications without maintaining any differences that naturally exist among different application categories, aggregated results can miss details and this can result in errors. In this paper, we propose a permission analysis model for android applications which includes a classification module and a malware detection module based on application permission vectors to deal with Android malware detection problem. We mine the benign application permission vector set into 32 categories by mining the similarity of permission vectors, and input malicious application permission vector sets into the model to obtain class labels, then extract sensitive features from different classes. Finally, sensitive features of each class are respectively input into the machine learning algorithm to obtain a classification model of malicious and benign applications. Our experimental results show that our model can achieve 93.66% accuracy of detecting malware instances. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Clustering; K-means; Malware detection; Permission vectors","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Parallel architectures; Smartphones; Vectors; Android applications; Application permissions; Classification models; Clustering; K-means; Malware detection; Privacy and security; Security laboratory; Mobile security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058613606"

Compared to sedentary species, long-distance migrants have narrower wings (for fast, efficient flight); they have fewer feather faults and avoid moulting flight feathers during migration (to optimise flight surface performance). It is unclear whether these patterns apply to species that fly short-intermediate distances, like tropical nomads. We compared wing shape, feather faulting, and flight-feather moult across five finch species from northern Australia with varying mobility: Pictorella Mannikins (Heteromunia pectoralis) and Gouldian Finches (Erythrura gouldiae) are highly mobile, nomadic at regional scales; Long-tailed Finches (Poephila acuticauda) and Double-barred Finches (Taeniopygia bichenovii) are sedentary with local nomadism; Crimson Finches (Neochmia phaeton) are sedentary. More mobile species had narrower wings and higher wing loading than relatively sedentary species, and less feather faulting. Variation in moult strategies was complex, but mobile species carried out moult fast, in a short time window, and moulted a single feather at a time. Unexpectedly, Gouldian Finch wings were more suited for fast efficient flight than Pictorella Mannikin wings, and yet they had more feather faulting. Differences in mobility may be a key dimension of niche separation that allows these species to co-exist. © 2017, © 2017 BirdLife Australia.","Feather fault; Gouldian Finch; moult strategy; nomadic bird; tropical savannah; wing shape","Australia; Aves; Erythrura gouldiae; Fringillidae; Heteromunia pectoralis; Lonchura; Neochmia phaeton; Poephila acuticauda; Taeniopygia bichenovii; Taenopygia bichenovii; body shape; flight activity; interspecific variation; life history trait; migratory species; mobility; molt; niche partitioning; passerine; plumage; savanna; tropical region","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052892215"

Current data reveal that the overdose crisis affects all demographic groups and that overdose rates are now rising most rapidly among African Americans. We provide a public health perspective that can be used to mobilize a comprehensive local, state, and national response to the opioid crisis. We argue that framing the crisis from a public health perspective requires considering the interaction of multiple determinants, including structural factors (eg, poverty and racism), the inadequate management of pain, and poor access to addiction treatment and harmreduction services (eg, syringe services). We propose a novel ecological framework for harmful opioid use that provides multiple recommendations to improve public health and clinical practice, including improved data collection to guide resource allocation, steps to increase safer prescribing, stigma-reduction campaigns, increased spending on harm reduction and treatment, criminal justice policy reform, and regulatory changes related to controlled substances. Focusing on these opportunities provides the greatest chance of making a measured and sustained impact on overdose and related harms. © 2018, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","addiction; health disparities; health policy; injury; pain management; stigma","Criminal Law; Data Collection; Drug Overdose; Harm Reduction; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pain Management; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Public Health; Research Design; Social Determinants of Health; Social Stigma; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; analgesia; clinical practice; criminal law; drug overdose; harm reduction; health care delivery; health care policy; information processing; legislation and jurisprudence; methodology; mortality; opiate addiction; organization and management; procedures; public health; social determinants of health; social stigma; socioeconomics; standards; statistics and numerical data; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056491060"

There are lots of research to detect malware to protect mobile devices, but most of them adopt only signature-based malware detection method that can be easily bypassed by polymorphic and metamorphic malware. To detect malware and its variants, it is essential to adopt behavior-based detection for efficient malware classification. This paper presents a system that classifies malware by using common behavioral characteristics along with malware families. We measure the similarity between malware families with carefully chosen features commonly appeared in the same family. With the proposed similarity measure, we can classify malware by malware's attack behavior pattern and tactical characteristics. Also, we apply community detection algorithm to increase the modularity within each malware family network aggregation. To maintain high classification accuracy, we propose a process to derive the optimal weights of the selected features in the proposed similarity measure. During this process, we find out which features are significant for representing the similarity between malware samples. Finally, we provide an intuitive graph visualization of malware samples which is helpful to understand the distribution and likeness of the malware networks.

Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that “taste” preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain. © 2017 The Authors.

Android, the most popular mobile operating system, has a privilege-separated security system through a sophisticated permission control mechanism. Android Apps need to request permissions to access sensitive personal data and system resources, but empirical studies have found that various types of malicious software could obtain permissions and attack systems and applications by deceiving users and the security mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach to detect malware by mining the patterns of Permissions and API Function Calls acquired and used by Android Apps. Based on static analysis of source code and resource files of Android Apps, binary and numerical features are extracted for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Feature selection methods are applied to reduce the feature dimension and enhance the efficiency. Different machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Neural Networks, are applied and compared in classification. The experimental results show that the proposed approach delivers accurate detection of Android malware. We deem that the proposed approach could help raise users' awareness of potential risks and mitigate malware threats for Android devices. © 2016 IEEE.","Android App; Android Permission; Malware; Neural Networks; Random Forest; Risk Assessment; Support Vector Machines","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Information science; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile devices; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Static analysis; Support vector machines; Android Permission; Feature selection methods; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Mobile operating systems; Quantitative evaluation; Random forests; Security mechanism; Mobile security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988909482"

Though existing approaches for authentication are user-friendly, they have vulnerabilities such as the possibility & criminally threatening a user. We propose a novel approach which uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals for an authentication process. Unique features of EEG data for distinguishing brain activities can potentially be used to authenticate a user. Compared to other biometric systems, this approach is very robust and more secure because response is significantly changed according to instantaneous mental condition. In the proposed approach, the system user is asked to visualize a number while corresponding EEG signals are captured. Captured signals are used to train the system, compared in the authentication process. This approach mainly focuses on the 8 to 30 Hz Alpha and Beta combined frequency band across all EEG channels, since it is the most appropriate band for EEG signals in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) values were used as main features to train the model. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used as a classification algorithm for a given set of user data. A trained set of models for each user is embedded in the system as a parameter database. Each user selects the profile attached to their trained model before the authentication session. Eventually, a trained model can authenticate a user after memorization of pre-determined four digits which the user is asked to think at the first stage of the process. The maximum accuracy recorded with the existing data was 96.97%. © 2016 IEEE.","Biometric systems; CSP; EEG; LDA","Biometrics; Brain; Brain computer interface; Discriminant analysis; Electroencephalography; Frequency bands; Interfaces (computer); Mobile telecommunication systems; Biometric authentication system; Biometric systems; Classification algorithm; Common spatial patterns; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Linear discriminant analysis; Maximum accuracies; Unique features; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006018322"

Especially, the use of new data sources in crime simulation models can contribute towards safer and smarter cities. Previous work on agent-based models for crime simulations have intended to simulate offender behavior in a geographical environment, relying exclusively on a small sample of offender homes and crime locations. The complex dynamics of crime and the lack of information on criminal offender’s movement patterns challenge the design of offender movement in simulations. At the same time, the availability of big, GPS-based user data samples (mobile data, social media data, etc.) already allowed researchers to determine the laws governing human mobility patterns, which, we argue, could inform offender movement. In this paper, we explore: (1) the use of location-based venue data from Foursquare in New York City (NYC), and (2) human dynamics insights from previous studies to simulate offender movement. We study 9 offender mobility designs in an agent-based model, combining search distances strategies (static, uniform distributed, and Lévy-flight approximation) and target selection algorithms (random intersection, random Foursquare venues, and popular Foursquare venues). The offender behavior performance is measured using the ratio of crime locations passed vs average distance traveled by each offender. Our initial results show that agents moving between POI perform best, while the performance of the three search distance strategies is similar. This work provides a step forward towards more realistic crime simulations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","ABM; Crime; Human mobility patterns; LSBN; Offender mobility; Simulation","Approximation algorithms; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Dynamics; Location; Social networking (online); Agent-based model; Geographical environment; Human mobility; Location-based social networks; LSBN; Simulation; Social media datum; Target selection algorithms; Crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029484773"

This paper, with the attack technologies of botnets as its main focus, gives an comprehensive introduction of the working mechanisms of botnets in terms of its definition, transmission, lifecycle, malicious behaviors and command and control channels, and divides the botnets' development into two stages, namely, attacks to traditional PC and extensive attacks, with the technological features, behavioral characteristics, case studies and evolutionary patterns of each stage elaborated in a detailed manner.

The adversary always uses a malware as the client to take remote control of smartphones, and leverages the vulnerability of operation systems to send back the collected information without users' permissions. All the information has to be transferred by network traffic. In this paper, we consider that different apps maybe generate different network flows by different operations, and the ""shapes"" of the benign flows and malicious ones will be diverse. Thus we propose a detection model based on the analysis of relationships between behavior patterns and network flows, which achieves our goal by using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to classify the network flows into benign or malicious. To further improve the controllability of the experiment, we design an app called Moledroid to simulate malwares by uploading the user's privacy without authorization, in addition, we can change the behavior pattern of the app to complete our evaluation. Finally, we run this app and several benign apps to generate traffic to detect the malicious network flows, and it shows that our detection model can achieve precision and accuracy higher than 95\%, which demonstrates that our model is suitable for detecting the network flows of information theft. © 2017 IEEE.","","Android (operating system); Crime; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Remote control; Smartphones; Behavior patterns; Detection models; Information leakage; Information thefts; Malicious attack; Network traffic; Operation system; Random forests; Network architecture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031735423"

The Study of the Delinquent as an Individual: Healy substituted for the methods of general observation, speculation, and statistics the all-round study of the individual delinquent. Trained in psychiatry and psychology, he emphasized physical examinations and mental tests without ignoring social factors. However, he relied upon the experience of the social worker instead of calling into service the technique of the sociologist. The Person as the Individual with Status: The study of individual behavior falls in the fields of psychiatry and psychology. The study of the person, as the product of social interaction, lies, primarily, in sociology. In the explanation and control of delinquency, it is significant to determine the nature of the participation of the person in the social organization, as in the insecurity or degradation of status, the type of personal behavior pattern, the degree of mobility, the change of the social environment and the collapse of the social world of the person. In the study of delinquency, the psychiatric, psychological, and sociological methods of investigation are not in conflict with each other, but rather complementary and interdependent. © Jeffery T.

In this paper, we propose a novel bipartite graph-based propagation approach, iBGP, for mobile apps advertising fraud detection in large advertising system. We exploit the characteristics of mobile advertising user's behavior and identify two persistent patterns: power law distribution and pertinence and propose an automatic initial score learning algorithm to formulate both concepts to learn the initial scores of non-seed nodes. We propose a weighted graph propagation algorithm to propagate the scores of all nodes in the user-app bipartite graphs until convergence. To extend our approach for large-scale settings, we decompose the objective function of the initial score learning model into separate one-dimensional problems and parallelize the whole approach on an Apache Spark cluster. iBGP was applied on a large synthetic dataset and a large real-world mobile advertising dataset; experiment results demonstrate that iBGP significantly outperforms other popular graph-based propagation methods. © 2017 Jinlong Hu et al.","","Behavioral research; Crime; Graphic methods; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Advertising frauds; Advertising systems; Mobile advertising; Objective functions; One dimensional problems; Power law distribution; Propagation algorithm; Propagation method; Graph theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018833552"

This method, at a proof of concept stage, builds upon recently published work demonstrating the opportunity to profile and identify multiple blood signatures in bloodstains via a bottom up proteomic approach. The present protocol addresses the limitation of the previously developed profiling method with respect to destructivity; destructivity should be avoided for evidence such as blood fingermarks, where the ridge detail must be preserved in order to provide the associative link between the biometric information and the events of bloodshed. Using a blood mark reference model, trypsin concentration and spraying conditions have been optimised within the technical constraints of the depositor eventually employed; the application of MALDI-MSI and Ion Mobility MS have enabled the detection, confirmation and visualisation of blood signatures directly onto the ridge pattern. These results are to be considered a first insight into a method eventually informing investigations (and judicial debates) of violent crimes in which the reliable and non-destructive detection and mapping of blood in fingermarks is paramount to reconstruct the events of bloodshed. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, some of the developers overlook security aspects that may leave apps to be infected with mobile malware. An effective way to encounter mobile malware infection is important to avoid the victim of the infected smartphone to lose any confidential, contacts, messages, pictures and any other important information in their smartphone. Therefore, this paper presents a new mobile malware classification based on call log exploitation to encounter the mobile malware infection using the covering algorithm. The system call has been used as the main feature for the classification formation. The experiment was conducted on 5560 Drebin dataset as for training dataset and 500 mobile applications from Google Play Store as the testing dataset in a controlled lab environment. Open source tools and dynamic analysis were used in this experiment. 206 patterns have been produced based on the proposed mobile malware classification. Furthermore, we have evaluated our patterns with the mobile apps from the Google Play Store, where 4% from the mobile apps in Google Play Store matched with our mobile malware patterns. This new mobile malware classification is beneficial to distinguish between the benign and malicious mobile apps and can be used as guidance for other researchers with the same interest in mobile malware analysis field.","Call log exploitation; Mobile malware; System call","Computer crime; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Statistical tests; Call log exploitation; Covering algorithms; Mobile applications; Mobile malware; Open source tools; Security aspects; System calls; Training dataset; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041207685"

Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender’s home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers’ location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Chicago; day of week; location choice; street robbery; time of day","economic aspect; expectation; high school; human; Illinois; model; victim","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011575253"

With ubiquitous shift to the mobile platforms, the rise of mobile malware and, in particular, banking malware came as no surprise. In general, any financial operation on the mobile platform potentially exposes a user to a variety of threats including data leakage, theft, and financial loss. Driven by financial profits, banking malware leverages user's cluelessness, openness of mobile plat forms, and lack of security measures. In this work, we aim to give insight into mobile banking malware and explore unique characteristics of its communication patterns.

In our problem setting, the patrol officers are assisted by the information collected by a network of binary proximity sensors installed in the building. We claim that learning even common movement sub-patterns that originate due to the constrained physical environment helps to find likely locations of intruders where each major location is instrumented using a sensor node. We use a series of binary detection events to infer likely future trajectories in a real-world building. For a given set of detectable nodes on the inferred future trajectories, we aim to find the optimal patrol dispatch node location with high exposure to intruders' future appearance using patrol officers in limited numbers, ideally fewer than the intruders. In order to prevent possible crime and perform responsive defense against potential intruders, our algorithm also tries to reduce the travel distance from patrols current positions to their dispatched positions at the same time. We validate our proposed scheme in terms of detection accuracy by varying the number of intruders, robustness against missing events, and responsiveness compared to a practical baseline counterpart through real-world system experiments. © 2016 IEEE.","","Bins; Location; Proximity sensors; Sensor nodes; Baseline counterparts; Binary detection; Detection accuracy; Future appearance; Physical environments; Real-world system; Surveillance systems; Travel distance; Trajectories","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983246785"

Standard CBR capability is augmented by machine learning techniques to assign parameter weights in the sample dataset and automate k-value random selection in k-NN classification to improve CBR performance. The CBR system observes users’ transaction behaviour within the MMT service and tries to detect abnormal patterns in the transaction flows. To capture user behaviour effectively, the CBR system classifies the log information into five contexts and then combines them into a single dimension, instead of using the conventional approach where the transaction amount, time dimensions or features dimension are used individually. The applicability of the proposed augmented CBR system is evaluated using simulation data. From the results, both dimensions show good performance with the context of information weighted CBR system outperforming the individual features approach. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Case-based reasoning; Genetic algorithm; Mobile money; Money transfer fraud; Simulation data","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Crime; Electronic money; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Abnormal patterns; Conventional approach; Individual features; K-NN classifications; Machine learning techniques; Mobile money; Money transfers; Simulation data; Case based reasoning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037731741"

Previous studies found that cocaine and methamphetamine use is related to impairment in identifying emotions and empathy. Stimulant users also have abnormal neural structure and function of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and anterior (ACC) and posterior cingulate (PCC), regions implicated in moral decision-making. However, no research has studied the neural correlates of stimulant use and explicit moral processing in an incarcerated population. Objectives: Here, we examine how stimulant use affects sociomoral processing that might contribute to antisocial behavior. We predicted that vmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and ACC would show abnormal neural response during a moral processing task in incarcerated methamphetamine and cocaine users. Methods: Incarcerated adult males (N = 211) were scanned with a mobile MRI system while completing a moral decision-making task. Lifetime drug use was assessed. Neural responses during moral processing were compared between users and non-users. The relationship between duration of use and neural function was also examined. Results: Incarcerated stimulant users showed less amygdala engagement than non-users during moral processing. Duration of stimulant use was negatively associated with activity in ACC and positively associated with vmPFC response during moral processing. Conclusions: These results suggest a dynamic pattern of fronto-limbic moral processing related to stimulant use with deficits in both central motive and cognitive integration elements of biological moral processes theory. This increases our understanding of how drug use relates to moral processing in the brain in an ultra-high-risk population. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ACC; Cocaine; fMRI; Limbic; Methamphetamine; Morality; Stimulant; vmPFC","Adult; Amygdala; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Decision Making; Emotions; Empathy; Frontal Lobe; Functional Neuroimaging; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Morals; Neural Pathways; Prefrontal Cortex; Prisoners; Substance-Related Disorders; central stimulant agent; adult; aged; amygdala; anterior cingulate; antisocial behavior; Article; brain function; cocaine dependence; controlled study; decision making; human; image analysis; intelligence quotient; male; methamphetamine dependence; morality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posterior cingulate; prediction; priority journal; prisoner; substance use; task performance; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; amygdala; antisocial personality disorder; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; decision making; diagnostic imaging; drug dependence; emotion; empathy; frontal lobe; functional neuroimaging; limbic system; middle aged; nerve tract; pathophysiology; prefrontal cortex","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978129495"

This, such as mobile Internet service provider (ISP) operator and device manufacturers, have applied an anti-virus product. However, there exhibit a high false-positive rate to detect malwares because these are based on patterns or heuristic. To solve this problem, this study proposed and implemented Android malware detection techniques in virtual environment, using single physical machine. The proposed system is divided into a host system and virtual environment. The former features black market crawler designed to collect malware, hypervisor targeted for the communication and control of virtual machine and host machine and main module which transmits analysis file and result log to each system.

Representing vast, dispersed permissions and achieving clarity is not a trivial matter. In this study, we first examined Android permissions, their groups and formal representations with the limitations. We also surveyed limited studies on clustering/visualization of permissions. We grouped 251 Android permissions into 12 clusters semantically and proposed a new visualization approach that looks more conventional to both end users and experts and helps comprehending permissions easily and quickly. We applied the proposed clustering and visualization on calculated discriminative malign permissions concept for malware analysis and demonstrated potential effectiveness of the approach.

The portability of these devices facilitates their use for recording videos in a wide variety of situations, including while witnessing criminal activities. These videos can be later used as evidence in legal proceedings. Therefore, the forensic analysis of videos taken with mobile device videos is important, and could serve for legal and also investigative purposes. It is necessary, however, to use techniques that are quite specific to this type of devices, given some peculiar features of their cameras. In this paper, we will address the issue of video source acquisition identification by presenting a technique based on sensor noise and wavelet transform extraction from video key frames. These frames are extracted using an efficient algorithm that takes their content into account, improving the selection of frames to be analyzed over past proposals. The scheme presented consists of four stages: (1) Key frames extraction, (2) sensor pattern noise extraction, (3) feature extraction, and (4) classifier training and prediction.

Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders’ awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders’ family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members’ residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders’ children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally. © 2016 American Society of Criminology","awareness space; crime location choice; discrete spatial choice modeling; residential areas of family members","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983541221"

The daily amount of malware has overwhelmed the detection process. This fact has motivated the need for developing malware detection and family attribution solutions with the least manual intervention. In response, we propose Cypider framework, a set of techniques and tools aiming to perform a systematic detection of mobile malware by building an efficient and scalable similarity network infrastructure of malicious apps. Our detection method is based on a novel concept, namely malicious community, in which we consider, for a given family, the instances that share common features. Under this concept, we assume that multiple similar Android apps with different authors are most likely to be malicious. Cypider leverages this assumption for the detection of variants of known malware families and zero-day malware. It is important to mention that Cypider does not rely on signaturebased or learning-based patterns. Alternatively, it applies community detection algorithms on the similarity network, which extracts sub-graphs considered as suspicious and most likely malicious communities. Furthermore, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique, namely community fingerprint, based on a learning model for each malicious community. Cypider shows excellent results by detecting about 50% of the malware dataset in one detection iteration. Besides, the preliminary results of the community fingerprint are promising as we achieved 87% of the detection. © 2016 ACM.","Android; Community detection; Fingerprinting; Malware","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Iterative methods; Network security; Palmprint recognition; Population dynamics; Security of data; Security systems; Android; Building community; Community detection; Community detection algorithms; Fingerprinting; Fingerprinting techniques; Manual intervention; Techniques and tools; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007557396"

Rather than forcing end users to continually self-authenticate via password pins or through other means on a time-interval basis [2-7], a system that continuously authenticates users provides a more frictionless relationship between a user's device and its physical security. Such a system, if effectively operating on a low-powered, unobtrusive, and secure basis, would make it viable for most consumer mobile devices. In this paper, we build upon our work in [1] to provide a novel authentication scheme that meets these requirements for a commonly adopted system.

Malicious attacks can exploit this kind of vulnerability to bypass Android security mechanism and compromise the integrity, confidentiality and availability of Android devices. However, so far there is not a sound approach at the source code level for app developers aiming to detect input validation vulnerabilities in Android apps. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting input validation flaws in Android apps and we implement a prototype named EasyIVD, which provides practical static analysis of Java source code. EasyIVD leverages backward program slicing to extract transaction and constraint slices from Java source code. Then EasyIVD validates these slices with predefined security rules to detect vulnerabilities in a known pattern. To detect vulnerabilities in an unknown pattern, EasyIVD extracts implicit security specifications as frequent patterns from the duplicated slices and verifies them. Then EasyIVD semi-automatically confirms the suspicious rule violations and reports the confirmed ones as vulnerabilities. We evaluate EasyIVD on four versions of original Android apps spanning from version 2.2 to 5.0. It detects 58 vulnerabilities including confused deputy attacks and denial of service attacks. Our results prove that EasyIVD can provide a practical defensive solution for app developers. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Android security; input validation; program slicing; static analysis; vulnerability detection","Android (operating system); Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Computer programming languages; Computer software; Denial-of-service attack; Java programming language; Network security; Security of data; Static analysis; Android securities; Input validation; Java source codes; Malicious attack; Program slicing; Rule violation; Static techniques; Vulnerability detection; Mobile security","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988354940"

The current research showed that social monitoring of information that has the potential to damage one's reputation has differential effects on deviant behavior in social-ecological environments that vary in level of mobility. Study 1 showed that residentially stable cities that employed more journalists-who can be regarded as social monitoring agents in a community-tended to have lower rates of violent crime than residentially stable cities that employed fewer journalists; by contrast, in residentially mobile cities, violent crime rates did not vary as a function of the number of journalists employed. In Study 2, we found that individual differences in perceptions of relational mobility moderated the effects of social monitoring on cheating in a die-under-cup game. Specifically, social monitoring cues reduced the likelihood of cheating but only among participants who perceived their immediate social environment to be low in relational mobility. The same results were replicated in Study 3, an experiment in which participants' perception of relational mobility was manipulated before completing an online maze game that allowed them to earn extra cash. In the low mobility condition, the percentage of participants who continued working on the mazes after reaching the time limit decreased as a function of social monitoring; however, this pattern was not observed in the high mobility condition.

Young men who perform decent cultural repertoires are highly exposed to victimization due to their moral rejection of crime-involved youth. Young men who perform flexible cultural repertoires, by incorporating and shifting between gang and decent repertoires, experience low victimization due to their adaptation to crime-involved youth.

It appears that the Dutch regions adjacent to Belgium, i.e., Zeeland-West-Brabant, Oost-Brabant and Limburg, have relatively more DNA matches with Belgium than the other Dutch regions. In other words, a DNA profile obtained from a crime scene close to the Dutch border with Belgium is more likely to match with the profile of a person whose DNA profile is stored in the Belgian database than a DNA profile that originates from a crime scene further afield. Our data suggest that crimes committed by repeat offenders show a spatial pattern despite the presence of a national border, with crime scenes clustering in relatively close proximity to each other. The results of this study provide a better understanding of geographical patterns of cross-border criminal mobility. © 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences","Cross-border crime; DNA match; DNA profile; Proximity effect; Prüm Treaty","Belgium; Crime; Databases, Nucleic Acid; DNA Fingerprinting; Humans; Netherlands; Belgium; crime; data base; human; Netherlands; recidivism; Belgium; crime; DNA fingerprinting; Netherlands; nucleic acid database","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995468275"

National agencies began implementing control measures that included vector control and recommending an increased use of repellents. Further, in response to the alarming and growing number of microcephaly cases in Brazil, the importance of avoiding pregnancies for two years was stressed. In this paper, we explore the role of mobility within communities characterized by extreme poverty, crime and violence. Specifically, the role of short term mobility between two idealized interconnected highly distinct communities is explored in the context of ZIKV outbreaks. We make use of a Lagrangian modeling approach within a two-patch setting in order to highlight the possible effects that short-term mobility, within highly distinct environments, may have on the dynamics of ZIKV outbreak when the overall goal is to reduce the number of cases not just in the most affluent areas but everywhere. Outcomes depend on existing mobility patterns, levels of disease risk, and the ability of federal or state public health services to invest in resource limited areas, particularly in those where violence is systemic. The results of simulations in highly polarized and simplified scenarios are used to assess the role of mobility. It quickly became evident that matching observed patterns of ZIKV outbreaks could not be captured without incorporating increasing levels of heterogeneity. The number of distinct patches and variations on patch connectivity structure required to match ZIKV patterns could not be met within the highly aggregated model that is used in the simulations. © 2016 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd","Multi-patch model; Residence times; Vector-borne diseases; Zika virus","Zika virus vaccine; Article; epidemic; human; infection risk; model; nonhuman; population size; public health service; residential care; simulation; two patch model; vector control; virus outbreak; virus transmission; Zika virus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070423868"

It first addresses theoretical perspectives on victim selection, namely the structural-choice model of victim selection, social interactionism, and target congruence. It then describes three data sources that have been used in prior research to study victim selection: police reports, victimization surveys, and offender interviews. Subsequently, empirical findings on victim selection are reviewed and organized into nine subsections: victims' demographic characteristics, psychological characteristics, physical characteristics, behavior, biological characteristics, prior victimization, relationship to the offender, behavior during the offense, and the role of randomness. The final section discusses research gaps and potential future directions in the field, including an emphasis on theoretical explanations and mediators, cross-cultural studies, methodological innovation and diversity, interactions between victim and offender characteristics, and generality across crime types and subpopulations. © Oxford University Press 2017.

In this paper, we present a personal visual analytics (PVA) system for Android security risk lifelog using app permissions to recognize the risk. Our system stores the security-related personal information on the smartphone device and utilizes it to analyze the security risk lifelog. For the risk analysis, we define security risk scores based on the app and permission statistics. Then, several linked visualizations are designed to present the risk lifelog. We have collected the security lifelog data from eight Android smartphone users and analyzed their security matters. Our PVA system enables Android smartphone users to observe, mitigate the security risk, and eventually understand how Android security risk affects their lives.

We aimed to confirm locations where PWID congregate in Cape Town, eThekwini and Tshwane (South Africa) and to estimate PWID population sizes within selected electoral wards in these areas to inform South Africa's first multi-site HIV prevention project for PWID. Methods: Field workers (including PWID peers) interviewed community informants to identify suspected injecting locations in selected electoral wards in each city and then visited these locations and interviewed PWID. Interviews were used to gather information about the accessibility of sterile injecting equipment, location coordinates and movement patterns. We used the Delphi method to obtain final population size estimates for the mapped wards based on estimates from wisdom of the crowd methods, the literature and programmatic data. Results: Between January and April 2015, we mapped 45 wards. Tshwane teams interviewed 39 PWID in 12 wards, resulting in an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging from 568 to 1431. In eThekwini, teams interviewed 40 PWID in 15 wards with an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging from 184 to 350. The Cape Town team interviewed 61 PWID in 18 wards with an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging between 398 and 503. Sterile needles were only available at one location. Almost all needles were bought from pharmacies. Between 80 and 86% of PWID frequented more than one location per day. PWID who reported movement visited a median of three locations a day. Conclusions: Programmatic mapping led by PWID peers can be used effectively to identify and reach PWID and build relationships where access to HIV prevention commodities for PWID is limited. PWID reported limited access to sterile injecting equipment, highlighting an important HIV prevention need. Programmatic mapping data show that outreach programmes should be flexible and account for the mobile nature of PWID populations. The PWID population size estimates can be used to develop service delivery targets and as baseline measures. © 2017 The Author(s).","Formative assessment; Harm reduction; HIV; People who inject drugs; Population size estimation; Programmatic mapping; South Africa","Adult; Delphi Technique; Drug Users; Female; Geographic Information Systems; Harm Reduction; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Needle-Exchange Programs; South Africa; Sterilization; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Urban Population; Article; controlled study; Delphi study; female; harm reduction; health care access; health care delivery; health care need; health care planning; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; injection site; major clinical study; male; miscellaneous named groups; people who inject drug; population research; population size; South Africa; syringe needle; urban area; ward; adult; attitude to health; drug use; geographic information system; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; instrument sterilization; preventive health service; psychology; substance abuse; urban population","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020173504"

The build-up to an attack includes planning, travel, and reconnaissance which necessarily require the offender to move through their environment. Whilst research has examined patterns of terrorist attack locations, with a few exceptions (e.g. Rossmo & Harries, 2011), it has not examined the spatial behavior of the terrorists themselves. In this paper, we investigate whether the spatial mobility patterns of terrorists resemble those of criminals (and the wider population) and if these change in the run up to their attacks. Method Using mobile phone data records for the ringleaders of four different UK-based terrorist plots in the months leading up to their attacks, we examine the frequency with which terrorists visit different locations, how far they travel from key anchor points such as their home, the distance between sequential cell-site hits and how their range of movement varies as the planned time to attack approaches. Conclusions Like the wider population (and criminals), the sample of terrorists examined exhibited predictable patterns of spatial behavior. Most movements were close to their home location or safe house, and they visited a relatively small number of locations most of the time. Disaggregating these patterns over time provided mixed evidence regarding the way in which their spatial activity changed as the time to the planned attack approached. The findings are interpreted in terms of how they inform criminological understanding of the spatial behavior of terrorists, and the implications for law enforcement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distance-decay; Routine activity space; Spatial behavior; Terrorism","United Kingdom; crime; mobile phone; mobility; spatiotemporal analysis; terrorism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021211176"

Recently, Android has become the most popular operating system opted by users and the most targeted platform for smartphone malware attack. Besides, current mobile malware classification and detection approaches are relatively immature as the new advanced malware exploitation and threats are difficult to be detected. Therefore, an efficient approach is proposed to improve the performance of the mobile malware classification and detection. In this research, a new system call classification with call logs exploitation for mobile attacks has been developed using tokenization approach. The experiment was conducted using static and dynamic-based analysis approach in a controlled lab. System calls with call logs exploitation from 5560 Drebin samples were extracted and further examined. This research paper aims to find the best n value and classifier in classifying the dataset based on the new patterns produced. Naïve Bayes classifier has successfully achieved accuracy of 99.86% which gives the best result among other classifiers.

Mobile cloud is experiencing challenges and obstacles in many forms which may include data replication, data consistency, scalability, lack of standardization, trust, privacy and security. However, despite the importance of the issue in both academia and industry, the assessment of the research productivity about the scientific global production is still not found in the literature. The scarcity in this type of information related to mobile cloud security research creates the need for a systematic global analysis which rather than individual studies, allows exploring the intellectual core and some properties of the research stream. The objective of this paper is to characterize the publication activity of mobile cloud security by data collected from the Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index databases from ISI Web of Science during 2000 to 2016. It provides insights into the research activities in this field and identifies patterns, tendencies, or regularities existing in the literature related to authors, journals, institutes, and countries. Results show that mobile cloud security literature has a positive growth rate, and it is likely to continue with this tendency in the future. However, the analysis shows the need for more security measures and discussion on the issue would only continue to increase as the applications of cloud computing becomes more prevalent and widespread. The lists provided within this study would act as guidance for future researchers to seek information, knowledge and policies while allowing for better decision making process. Furthermore, several suggestions have been made in order for this particular field of study to have more enhanced literature.","Cloud computing; Cloud security; Mobile cloud computing; Security","Cloud computing; Computer crime; Decision making; Indexing (of information); Network function virtualization; Bibliometric analysis; Cloud securities; Decision making process; Publication activities; Research productivity; Science citation index; Security; Social science citation indices; Mobile cloud computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018988239"

In this study, we use data from Geo-Twitter to analyze the reasons underlying the occurrence of local criminal activity. In recent years, abundant location-based social network (LBSN) (e.g., Foursquare, Geo-Twitter) data has become easily available at a low cost. Therefore, many studies have used LBSNs data to model and understand human mobile behavior, such as patterns of human travel and activity. However, few studies on local criminal activities have been reported. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to identify the reasons underlying local criminal activity from the view point of geographic and environmental factors. Our methodology consists of the following steps. First, we collect geo-tagged data from Twitter. In particular, we extract a large corpus with geo-tags, called tweets, from major cities in the United States. Second, we measure the sentiments expressed in tweets posted from a specific area using the fastText model [1]. Third, we apply a simple clustering technique called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify the topics that are clustered in each area using sentimental analysis. Lastly, we analyze the reasons for crime by comparing the topics and the information on all crime using the data portal. © 2017 IEEE.","location analysis; sentiment analysis; social media; Twitter","Behavioral research; Crime; Social networking (online); Statistics; Crime Prevention; Criminal activities; Environmental factors; Geographics; Location analysis; Location-based social networks; Low-costs; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter; Sentiment analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046090327"

This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for 'theft from the person' crimes. Method: 1.Collect 'ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media.2.Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor.3.Use the Gi* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators.4.Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates. Results and Discussion: The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors - i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people. © 2015 The Authors.","Ambient population; Clustering; Crime pattern analysis; Social media","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961266749"

Numerous studies have shown psychopathy-related limbic brain abnormalities during moral processing; however, these studies only examined negatively valenced moral stimuli. Here, we aimed to replicate prior psychopathy research on negative moral judgments and to extend this work by examining psychopathy-related abnormalities in the processing of controversial moral stimuli and positive moral processing. Incarcerated adult males (N = 245) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol on a mobile imaging system stationed at the prison. Psychopathy was assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R). Participants were then shown words describing three types of moral stimuli: wrong (e.g., stealing), not wrong (e.g., charity), and controversial (e.g., euthanasia). Participants rated each stimulus as either wrong or not wrong. PCL-R total scores were correlated with not wrong behavioral responses to wrong moral stimuli, and were inversely related to hemodynamic activity in the anterior cingulate cortex in the contrast of wrong > not wrong. In the controversial > noncontroversial comparison, psychopathy was inversely associated with activity in the temporal parietal junction and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that psychopathy-related abnormalities are observed during the processing of complex, negative, and positive moral stimuli. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Decision making; fMRI; Incarceration; Moral; Prosocial; Psychopathy","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Brain; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Criminals; Decision Making; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Morals; Neuropsychological Tests; Prisoners; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reaction Time; Reading; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; antisocial personality disorder; brain; brain circulation; clinical trial; decision making; diagnostic imaging; human; male; middle aged; morality; multicenter study; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; offender; pathophysiology; physiology; prisoner; psychological interview; psychological rating scale; reaction time; reading; vision; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983502955"

Conflicts between peers can be easily staged since nearly everybody can be reached at any time under the radar of authorities. Therefore, involvement in conflicts and bullying might depend on how adolescents use and behave online. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive picture of the role aspects of online communication play in long-term involvement in cyberbullying. We focused on a gender-specific perspective, as girls and boys were found to differ not only according to their online communication but also in their cyberbullying involvement. Using a two-wave panel survey of 1817 adolescents between 13 and 17 years (56 % female), we found that girls’ cyberbullying involvement (perpetration and victimization) could be traced back to more intensive online social activities and a higher amount of online contact with strangers. In contrast, for boys, only higher exposure to antisocial media content predicted higher levels of victimization over time. The findings indicate that certain patterns of online communication increase the cyberbullying risk over time. However, it needs to be noted that these risk factors vary between girls and boys. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescence; Cyberbullying; Online communication; Online risk behavior; Panel survey","Adolescent; Bullying; Cell Phone; Communication; Crime Victims; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Risk-Taking; Sex Factors; adolescence; child; exposure; female; gender; girl; human; major clinical study; male; risk factor; social behavior; social media; adolescent; bullying; crime victim; high risk behavior; Internet; interpersonal communication; mobile phone; sex factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980025404"

The Crooked Ladder represents a groundbreaking attempt to describe how some members of ethnic minorities have utilized organized crime as one vehicle of upward mobility, advancing from lower-class status to middle-class power and respectability.O'Kane illustrates the criminal road to prosperity as a process of displacement and succession: each group competes with and eventually eliminates its more established predecessor from the upper echelons of organized crime. This historical criminal succession mirrors the upward mobility of the Irish, Jews, and Italians in the larger, conventional noncriminal realm. Arguing that African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics are pursuing similar criminal routes, O'Kane takes issue with contemporary social scientists who view the current plight of minorities as unique in American social life.As a fundamental rethinking of the American ethnic experience with crime, The Crooked Ladder will be essential reading for social historians, sociologists, and criminologists. Now available in paperback, it will be useful in criminology courses and well as classes in ethnicity and social relations. © 1992 by Taylor & Francis.

However, existing studies have failed to capture the complex social location transition patterns of suspects and lack the capacity to address the issue of data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel location prediction model called CMoB (Crime Multi-order Bayes model) based on the spatiotemporal semantics to enhance the prediction performance. In particular, the model groups suspects with similar spatiotemporal semantics as one target suspect. Then, their mobility data are applied to estimate Markov transition probabilities of unobserved locations based on a KDE (kernel density estimating) smoothing method. Finally, by integrating the total transition probabilities, which are derived from the multi-order property of the Markov transition matrix, into a Bayesian-based formula, it is able to realize multi-step location prediction for the individual suspect. Experiments with the mobility dataset covering 210 suspects and their 18,754 location records from January to June 2012 in Wuhan City show that the proposed CMoB model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for suspect location prediction in the context of data sparsity. © 2017 by the authors.

These methods capture the interactions between mobile apps and Android system, but ignore the communications among components within or cross application boundaries. As a consequence, the majority of the existing methods are less effective in identifying many typical malwares, which require a few or no suspicious resources, but leverage on inter-component communication (ICC) mechanism when launching stealthy attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a new malware detection method, named ICCDetector. ICCDetector outputs a detection model after training with a set of benign apps and a set of malwares, and employs the trained model for malware detection. The performance of ICCDetector is evaluated with 5264 malwares, and 12026 benign apps. Compared with our benchmark, which is a permission-based method proposed by Peng et al. in 2012 with an accuracy up to 88.2%, ICCDetector achieves an accuracy of 97.4%, roughly 10% higher than the benchmark, with a lower false positive rate of 0.67%, which is only about a half of the benchmark. After manually analyzing false positives, we discover 43 new malwares from the benign data set, and reduce the number of false positives to seven. More importantly, ICCDetector discovers 1708 more advanced malwares than the benchmark, while it misses 220 obvious malwares, which can be easily detected by the benchmark. For the detected malwares, ICCDetector further classifies them into five newly defined malware categories, which help understand the relationship between malicious behaviors and ICC characteristics. We also provide a systemic analysis of ICC patterns of benign apps and malwares. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; ICC; Malware Detection","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Computer systems programming; Intrusion detection; Android; Android systems; Detection models; False positive rates; Malicious behavior; Malware detection; Mobile malware; Systemic analysis; Malware","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963956647"

Being used by users with varying degrees of awareness complicates the problem further. Most of the security problems are due to maliciousness of android applications. The malwares get installed in mobile phones through various popular applications particularly gaming applications or some utility applications from various third party app-stores which are untrustworthy. A common feature of the malware is to access the sensitive information from the mobile device and transfer it to remote servers. For our work, we have confined ourselves to defining maliciousness as leakage of privacy information by Android application. In this paper we have proposed a method named as CREDROID which identifies malicious applications on the basis of their Domain Name Server(DNS) queries as well as the data it transmits to remote server by performing the in-depth analysis of network traffic logs in offline mode. Instead of performing signature based detection which is unable to detect polymorphic malwares, we propose a pattern based detection. Pattern in our work refers to the leakage of sensitive information being sent to the remote server.

Indeed, attacks can be performed on the users' devices without user awareness, this represents additional risk in mission critical scenarios, such as Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR). Intrusion Detection Systems are important for scenarios where information leakage is of crucial importance, since they allow to detect possible attacks to information assets (e.g., installation of malware), or can even compromise the security of PPDR personnel. HyIDS is an Hybrid IDS for Android and supporting the stringent security requirements of PPDR, by comprising agents that continuously monitor mobile device and periodically transmit the data to an analysis framework at the Command Control Center (CCC). The data collection retrieves resource usage metrics for each installed application such as CPU, memory usage, and incoming and outgoing network traffic. At the CCC, the HyIDS employs Machine Learning techniques to identify patterns that are consistent with malware signatures based on the data collected from the applications. The HyIDS's evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed solution has low impact on the mobile device in terms of battery consumption and CPU/memory usage. © 2017 IFIP.","","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Disaster prevention; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Mercury (metal); Mobile agents; Mobile devices; Network security; Risk perception; Analysis frameworks; Battery consumption; Evaluation results; Hybrid intrusion detection; Information leakage; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning techniques; Security requirements; Mobile security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029408618"

At its core, the many strands of environmental criminology are bound by a common focus on the role that the immediate environment plays in the performance of crime, and a conviction that careful analyses of these environmental influences are the key to the effective investigation, control, and prevention of crime. This new edition brings together leading theorists and practitioners in the field to provide a comprehensive, integrative coverage of the field of environmental criminology and crime analysis. This book is divided into three sequential parts: • Understanding the crime event explores routine activity approach, crime pattern theory, the rational choice perspective, and situational precipitators of crime. • Analysing crime patterns discusses crime mapping, offender mobility, repeat victimisation, geographic profiling, and crime scripts. • Preventing and controlling crime covers topics including problem oriented policing, situational crime prevention, and environmental design. Fully updated and including new chapters on crime scripts and offender mobility, a scene-setting introductory overview, and critical thinking questions at the end of each chapter, this text is an essential and comprehensive resource for practitioners and students taking courses on environmental criminology, crime analysis, and crime prevention. © 2017 Richard Wortley and Michael Townsley.

Research has advanced from data acquisition techniques to evidence representation methodologies, advanced evidence parsing, and data analysis automation. As technology evolves and functionalities of mobile devices extend to other environments (cloud, Internet of Things, wearable devices, enterprise mobility management with bring your own device [BYOD] support), the probability of their involvement in crimes increases, with their portability and the data types they are storing being potential causes among others. Mobile devices nowadays serve multiple purposes simultaneously, varying from personal use to performance of business transactions, thus exchanging and saving big data quantities. Such a combination of data variety and quantity is rendering the extraction of conclusions during a forensic investigation more difficult than it used to be when mobile devices were not interoperating with many different environments. In this chapter, we are proposing a high-level outline of a multivariate inference system consisting of mobile forensic data from various sources, such as the devices themselves, cloud services, and different sensors. We are using logical rules so as to combine different data features and reach conclusions based on real-life scenarios. Moreover, we are testing two different fuzzy system membership functions in order to define the more suitable for our system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt toward the creation of a semi-automatic fuzzy inference system, which uses forensically acquired data. Previous automation attempts in the field are related to text clustering and classification of network attacks based on their severity and the number of network nodes involved. Neither binary nor text values are convenient for forensic data representation purposes. On the one hand, binary state representations are limited and cannot depict a situation at its whole. On the other hand, text-based solutions are semantics-associated, which, despite being useful, are out of the scope of this chapter and have been researched extensively. We are using the approach of assigning fuzzy values of different scaling to text variables with fixed values and then proceed to rule generation. The goal of the presented system is not to replace human expertise, but to facilitate investigations by acting as an experienced advisor, by using information to the maximum possible extent. Forensic data analysis upon post-criminal activity is actually an auditing procedure aiming to discover the guilty entities, by observing data usage patterns, which can be used as feed for detection methods in intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and serve for continuous performance improvement. However, this cooperation is not unidirectional. IDS logging also offers forensic mechanisms useful insights toward investigation discoveries. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC CRC Press is an imprint of Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.","","Automation; Big data; Computer crime; Crime; Data acquisition; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Information analysis; Intrusion detection; Membership functions; Network security; Semantics; Text processing; Wearable technology; Bring your own devices; Business transaction; Continuous performance improvements; Criminal activities; Criminal investigation; Forensic investigation; Fuzzy inference systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Digital forensics","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052454213"

This motivates us to study mobile app security, especially in Android open mobile operating system. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for mobile malware detection by adopting both dynamic analysis and static analysis. We collect execution data of sample malware and benign apps using a net_link technology to generate patterns of system calls related to file and network access. Furthermore, we build up a malicious pattern set and a normal pattern set by comparing the patterns of malware and benign apps with each other. For detecting an unknown app, we use a dynamic method to collect its system calling data. We then compare them with both the malicious and normal pattern sets offline in order to judge the unknown app. Based on the test on a set of mobile malware and benign apps, we found that our approach achieves better detection success rate than some methods using either static analysis or dynamic analysis. What is more, the proposed approach is generic, which can detect different types of malware effectively. Its detection accuracy can be further improved since the pattern sets can be automatically optimized through self-learning. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Android; Malware detection; Pattern match; System call","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Malware; Pattern matching; Pattern recognition; Static analysis; Android; Android securities; Detection accuracy; Hybrid approach; Malware detection; Mobile operating systems; Network access; System calls; Mobile security","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006166560"

Mobile malwares can lead to several cybersecurity threats i.e. stealing sensitive information, installing backdoors, ransomware attacks and sending premium SMSs etc. Previous studies have shown that due to the sophistication of threats and tailored techniques to avoid detection, not every antivirus system is capable of detecting advance threats. However, an extra layer of security at the network side can protect users from these advanced threats by analyzing the traffic patterns. To detect these threats, this paper proposes and evaluates, a Machine Learning (ML) based model for Network based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). In this research, several supervised ML classifiers were built using data-sets containing labeled instances of network traffic features generated by several malicious and benign applications. The focus of this research is on Android based malwares due to its global share in mobile malware and popularity among users. Based on the evaluation results, the model was able to detect known and unknown threats with the accuracy of up to 99.4%. This ML model can also be integrated with traditional intrusion detection systems in order to detect advanced threats and reduce false positives. © 2016 Infonomics Society.","Anomaly Detection; Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning; Mobile Malware; Traffic Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Learning systems; Malware; Mercury (metal); Anomaly detection; Anti-virus systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning classification; Mobile malware; Network based intrusion detection systems; Sensitive informations; Traffic analysis; Intrusion detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015980598"

The overarching pattern of this research is that, despite the various motivations for crime, crime is patterned across space and those crime patterns are stable over time. Consequently, understanding the nature of those spatial patterns is critical for understanding crime. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new set of theories emerged to explain the spatial patterns of crime: routine activity theory, geometry of crime and rational choice theory - collectively known as environmental criminology. Routine activity theory, developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson, states that in order to have a criminal event, a motivated offender and a suitable target must converge in space and time in the absence of a capable guardian. The origins of the contemporary theories within environmental criminology are largely related to, or became associated with, crime prevention. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Avi Brisman, Eamonn Carrabine and Nigel South; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133294780"

Conventional fingerprint-based localization techniques that utilize received signal strength or channel information as location fingerprints may face problems when dealing with emitters whose parameters, such as center frequency, are unknown. In this paper, a novel localization algorithm utilizing the phase-difference between elements of an antenna array as location fingerprints is proposed. The training fingerprints are interpolated in the frequency and spatial domains before performing pattern matching with the unknown emitter's fingerprints. Localization accuracy was evaluated through ray-tracing and Monte Carlo simulations, and results indicate that the proposed technique achieved relatively good performance compared to other localization techniques. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Fingerprint; frequency interpolation; geolocation; illegal radio; localization; spatial interpolation; unknown emitter; urban environment","Antenna arrays; Crime; Intelligent systems; Interpolation; Monte Carlo methods; Pattern matching; Ray tracing; Fingerprint; Frequency interpolation; Geolocations; localization; Spatial interpolation; unknown emitter; Urban environments; Mobile computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029948817"

These events may result in higher crime rates, spreading of infectious diseases, economic crises, and even in migration phenomena (e.g., refugees across borders or internally displaced people). Hence, researchers have started using mobile phone data for developing tools to identify such emergency events in real time. In our paper, we apply a stochastic model, namely a Markov modulated Poisson process, for spatio-temporal detection of hourly and daily behavioral anomalies. We use the call volumes collected from an entire geographic region. Our work is based on the assumption that people tend to make calls when extraordinary events take place. We validate our methodology using a dataset of mobile phone records and events (emergency and non-emergency) from the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. Our results show that we can successfully capture anomalous calling patterns associated with violent events, riots, as well as social non-emergency events such as holidays, sports events. Moreover, call volume changes also show significant temporal and spatial differences depending on the type of an event.

All kinds of mobile applications are emerging. In addition to the official market, there are also many ways to allow users to download the mobile app. As unidentified instances of malware grow day by day, off-the-shelf malware detection methods identify malicious programs mainly with extracted signatures of codes, which only can effectively identify already known malwares, but not new malwares in initial spread. If no samples of these malwares are reported and the virus code library is not patched, users won't be alerted to the malwares. Therefore, this paper proposed a new detection method by live log analysis. A sandbox is conducted to mimic human operations and monitor responses from APPs. Feeding these manual events can excite deactivated malwares and improve the accuracy of log analysis, even though these malware are unknown yet. This study takes recent malwares and benign programs to conduct experiments, and then verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with those in other papers. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms in both hit rate and pass rate. © 2016 IEICE.","Data Mining; live event feeding; Malware Detection; Sandbox","Computer crime; Data mining; Feeding; Viruses; Detection methods; Log analysis; Malware detection; Mobile applications; Mobile malware; Pattern analysis; Sandbox; Smart devices; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006341505"

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, rural municipalities (kommuner) often adopted policies aimed to expel them from or to prevent them from entering the municipality. This is well established by previous research. What is less known is that another kind of territorial exclusion existed as well: that of collective violence against Roma and Travellers - or against ""zigenare"" (""gypsies"") and ""tattare"", as they were pejoratively called. In these cases, groups of local men, often armed, came together to use physical force to drive off families. In this essay, 17 such cases in the period 1872-1955 are analysed. The results show that collective violence occurred throughout the whole period, mainly in southern Sweden. Up until the first years of the 20th century, the perpetrators were often groups of farmers or farmhands. Some incidents were preceded by rumours claiming that a single Roma or Traveller had committed a crime. These rumours, true or false, were then used to mobilize collective action against whole families. In two cases, local political decisions were essential to the mobilization: in one incident, the municipality even paid the fines for a farmer who was sentenced for acting violently. Some patterns in the violence directed against Roma and Travellers occur throughout the period, especially the method to subject houses owned by families labelled as ""tattare"" to systematic destruction. This method was used in the 1870's as well as in the 1940's. With some exceptions the police often reacted late when collective violence was aimed at families labelled as ""tattare"" or ""zigenare"", or treated the perpetrators in a lenient way, thereby more or less legitimizing the violence. To an even greater degree, this can be said of the local newspapers. The papers typically depicted the attacked families as dangerous people who had only themselves to blame. Some of the most striking examples of newspapers legitimizing collective violence are as recent as from the 1940's. The findings of this essay stress the importance of analysing not only the aims and means of participants in collective action, but also of analysing external agents such as politicians, the police and the press. These agents do not necessarily take active part in the physical violence, but play important roles in mobilizing, legitimizing and escalating racist, collective action - or, just as important, in delegitimizing and de-escalating it.","19th century; 20th century; Collective violence; Racism; Roma; Sweden; Travellers","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038868206"

Since the majority of new malware are generated using existing malicious code, it becomes very important tracking the mobile malware phylogeny. In this work, a Process Mining (PM) approach for building a malware phylogeny model using information contained in system calls traces, is proposed. The adoption of a declarative Process Mining technique allows to mine a constraint-based model that can be effectively used as a malware fingerprint expressing relationships and recurring execution patterns among system calls in the execution flows. The model characterizes the behavior of malware applications allowing the identification of similarities across malware families and among malware variants belonging to the same family. The proposed approach is evaluated using a dataset of more than 700 infected applications across seven malware families obtaining very encouraging results. © 2016 IEEE.","Declare; Linear temporal logic; Malware evolution; Malware phylogeny; Process mining; Security","Biology; Computation theory; Computer crime; Data mining; Global system for mobile communications; Constraint-based modeling; Declare; Linear temporal logic; Malicious codes; Malware detection; Malware families; Process mining; Security; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015203856"

Our approach focuses on the structure of information ows we gather in our analysis, and the patterns of behavior present in information ows. Our analysis not only gathers simple ows that have a single source and a single sink, but also Multi-Flows that either start from a single source and ow to multiple sinks, or start from multiple sources and ow to a single sink. This analysis captures more complex behavior that both recent malware and recent benign applications exhibit. We leverage N-gram analysis to understand both unique and common behavioral patterns present in Multi-Flows. Our tool leverages N-gram analysis over sequences of API calls that occur along control ow paths in Multi-Flows to precisely analyze Multi-Flows with respect to app behavior. Using our approach, we show that there is a need to look beyond simple ows in order to effectively leverage information ow analysis for malware detection. By analyzing recently-collected malware, we show there has been an evolution in malware beyond simply collecting sensitive information and immediately exposing it. Many previous systems focus on identifying the existence of simple information ows|i.e. considering an information ow as just a (source, sink) pair. However, modern malware performs complex computations before, during, and after collecting sensitive information and tends to aggregate data before exposing it. A simple (source, sink) view of information ow does not adequately capture such behavior. The uniqueness of our approach comes from the following two features. First, our information ow analysis represent an information ow not as a simple (source, sink) pair, but as a sequence of API calls. This gives us the ability to distinguish different ows with same sources and sinks based on the computation performed along the information ow. Second, our information ow analysis detects Multi-Flows, ows that either start with a single source and ow to multiple sinks, or start with multiple sources and ow to a single sink. We treat such ows as a single ow, instead of multiple distinct ows. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of a Multi-Flow and its corresponding simple ows. This allows us to examine the structure of the ows themselves. We leverage machine learning techniques to extract features from Multi-Flows and their API sequences (N-gram analysis) and use these features to perform SVM-based classification. Based on this approach, we build an open source implementation of Multi-Flow analysis and API sequencing in the BlueSeal framework [2] [3] [1], along with N-gram analysis and a SVM-based classifier. We also conduct a detailed evaluation study, highlighting the differences in old and new apps. We leverage the app behavior extracted as features from both Multi-Flows and their API usage patterns and apply machine learning techniques to automatically identify malware based on the structure of its computation over sensitive data. We test our tool on a set of 1,576 benign apps downloaded from Google Play and 2,422 known malicious apps. Our results show that app behavior difference on sensitive data can be a significant factor in malware detection.","","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; E-learning; Education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Behavioral patterns; Complex computation; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Open source implementation; Sensitive informations; Simple informations; SVM-based classifiers; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026239531"

Methods: Results from an Australian university were analysed (N = 3798 results, N = 1459 students). Performances on unsupervised and supervised assessment items were converted to percentages and percentage point differences analysed at the academic discipline-, unit-, and student-level, looking for non-random patterns of unusually large differences. Results: Non-random, unusual patterns, consistent with contract cheating, were found at the academic discipline-, unit-, and student-level, with approximately 2.1% of students producing multiple unusual patterns. Conclusions: These findings suggest it may be possible to use existing administrative data to identify assessment items that provide suitable opportunities for contract cheating. This approach could be used in conjunction with targeted problem-prevention strategies (based on situational crime prevention) to reduce the vulnerability of academic assessment items to contract cheating. This approach is worthy of additional research as it has the potential to help academic institutions around the world manage contract cheating; a problem that currently threatens the validity and integrity of tertiary qualifications. © 2017 The Author(s).","Academic integrity; Contract cheating; Rational choice; Routine activity theory; Situational crime prevention","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048311230"

The interaction of different ecological features with these structures is analysed. The western Palaearctic was divided into 95 geographic entities. We produced presence-only matrices for all 955 Cerambycoidea species autochthonous to this area and derived species richness distributions and extracted faunal regions and faunal elements by cluster analyses and principal component analyses. Similar analyses were performed for sub-families and ecological groups. Longhorn beetles show a strong biogeographic structuring in the western Palaearctic. Species numbers strongly decrease to the north and west. Less mobile species and root feeders mostly contribute to the fauna of the Mediterranean region, whilst mobile species are more widespread. Feeders on broad-leaved trees dominate in western Europe, whilst feeders on coniferous trees are most important in northern Europe. Our results support multiple refugia in the Mediterranean region and underline the importance of Provence, Crimea and Crete as such refugia. Crete even might be an area of old endemism. The Atlanto- and the Ponto-Mediterranean regions are more strongly structured than assumed in classical biogeography. Mediterranean assemblages are mostly composed of non-flying species, root feeders and species with small distributions not found outside their glacial refugia. Tree feeders left their glacial retreats with their host plants. These range dynamics result in biogeographic structures with several dispersal barriers and filters composed of mountains, sea straits and climatic conditions. © 2016, Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik.","Biogeographic filters; Ecological features; Glacial refugia; Island biogeography; Postglacial colonisation; Species diversity","Coleoptera; Coniferales; beetle; biogeography; broad-leaved forest; cluster analysis; colonization; dispersal; endemism; island biogeography; natural barrier; Postglacial; principal component analysis; range expansion; refugee; species diversity; species richness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014579981"

Availability of multiple sources for downloading applications has aided the malware developers by increasing the consumer base for their applications. This has caused users falling victim to malicious applications. A major hindrance in blocking the entry of malicious applications into the Android market place is scarcity of effective mechanisms to detect malicious applications. Static analysis of an Android application gives a good idea as to what the application is capable of, but it's effectiveness decreases if the application is obfuscated. Dynamic analysis of an Android application shows the true behavior of the application during execution. Thus dynamic analysis is more useful in uncovering the threats that the user has from an application. The contribution of this work includes automation of Android application execution on an emulator to facilitate dynamic analysis of the application. Based on information collected during dynamic analysis of malware samples, we derived a set of patterns which indicate the occurrence of malicious activity.

This study identifies the key factors associated with outpatient general practitioner (GP), nursing or psychiatric healthcare utilization (HCU) within prisons. Cross-sectional data systematically collected by the prison medical staff were obtained for a sample of 1664 adult prisoners of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, for the year 2011. They contain detailed information on demographics (predisposing factors), diagnosed chronic somatic and psychiatric disorders (needs factors), as well as prison stay characteristics (contextual factors). For GP, nurse and psychiatric care, two-part regressions are used to model separately the probability and the volume of HCU. Predisposing factors are generally not associated with the probability to use healthcare services after controlling for needs factors. However, female inmates use higher volumes of care, and the volume of GP consultations increases with age. Chronic somatic and psychiatric conditions are the most important predictors of the probability of HCU, but associations with volumes differ in their magnitude and significance across disease groups. Infectious, musculoskeletal, nervous and circulatory diseases actively mobilize GP and nursing staff. Schizophrenia, illicit drug and pharmaceuticals abuse are strongly positively associated with psychiatric and nurse HCU. The occupancy rate displays positive associations among contextual factors. Prison healthcare systems face increasingly complex organizational, budgetary and ethical challenges. This study provides relevant insights into the HCU patterns of a marginalized and understudied population. © 2017 Moschetti et al.

These children are difficult to adopt because of their personal situation or their state of health. International adoption leads adoptive parents to move to a foreign country with unknown language, customs, culture and administrative formalities, leading to a feeling of loss of control, placing them in a vulnerable position. Some international adoptions cause real suffering for both the adopted child and his/her parents, especially when trauma disrupts the filiation process. Objectives: The objective is to understand, from a clinical vignette, how filiation process is implemented in case of trauma. It means, to understand how parents can integrate the real child and recognize themselves in him or her and how the adopted child with traumatic injuries can build a bond of love and trust to others. Material and methods: Clinical observation concerns a girl, abandoned at birth by her mother and who was victim on the second day of life, of an attempted murder with machetes. The child has been placed in an orphanage since that day. The aggression had serious after effects, not only physically but also psychologically. Thus, since the age 3 years, she has developed self-destructive behaviors with endangerments, including life-threatening situations. The first meeting between this child, aged 6, and her adoptive parents takes place at the orphanage. Not supported in this approach, parents are confronted with the relational difficulties of their adoptive daughter. Very isolated in a foreign country, they feel a deep uneasiness and they question the validity of the adoption process, causing shame and guilt and even suicidal ideation. Once in France, the girl adapts quickly to the culture of her new country. Psychotherapy undertaken to put into words the emotions and the behaviors allows an appeasement in the family relations and the disappearance of violent agitations. But the process of filiation, still hampered by the trauma of this violent first meeting, requires the pursuit of psychotherapy to allow parents to accept the loss of the object, here the imaginary child and the parental ideal. Results: From this clinical observation, it appears that the first interactions between parents and adopted child play an important role in the construction of relationship. The parents welcome the child with a set of fantastical representations that reveal the place that has been given to him. Adaptation will be done by psychic movements, by comparing and relativizing the imagined child with the real child. It is a double movement of adaptation of both parents and child. In the mourning of the imaginary child, there is also the mourning of the perfect parent; it is in the articulation of these two losses that the depressive state of the baby blues arises. This baby blues can evolve into psychotrauma in case of confrontation with the violence of reality. Thirty percent of adopted children have, at the time of adoption, disorganized attachment patterns; but adoption would most often enable recovery through the mobilization of parents’ psychic abilities and their own attachment patterns. Hence, a necessary assistance for parents. Conclusion: In the current context of international adoption, it is important to provide prevention with specialized places and trained teams in order to recognize critical situations, help families and enable filiation process to take place. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Attachment; Clinical case; International adoption; Parenthood; Psychotrauma","abandoned child; acceptance and commitment therapy; adopted child; adoption; adoptive filiation; adoptive parent; aggression; agitation; Article; automutilation; baby blue; behavior disorder; child; child parent relation; clinical observation; crime victim; disorganized attachment pattern; emotion; emotional attachment; endangerment; family relation; guilt; human; international adoption; life threat; love; mourning; movement perception; orphanage; perception; physic ability; psychotherapy; psychotrauma; self concept; self destructive behavior; shame; social adaptation; social isolation; social validity; suicidal ideation; trust","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015720260"

To uphold security integrity and maintain user confidence, various approaches have been studied in the field of malware detection. As malware become more capable at hiding its malicious intent through the use of code obfuscation, it becomes imperative for malware detection techniques to keep up with the pace of malware changes. Currently, most of the existing malware detection approaches for Android platform use semantic pattern matching, which is highly effective but is limited to what the computers have encountered before. However, their performance degrades significantly when it comes to identifying malicious apps they have never tackled before. In this paper, we propose DroidDeepLearner, an Android malware characteri-zation and identification approach that uses deep learning algorithm to address the current need for malware detection to become more autonomous at learning to solve problems with less human intervention. Experimental results have shown that the DroidDeepLearner approach achieves good performance when compared to the existing widely used malware detection approaches. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; deep learning; machine learning; malware","Computer crime; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Pattern matching; Semantics; Android; Android platforms; Code obfuscation; Human intervention; Identification approach; Malware detection; Semantic pattern; Sensitive informations; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015156545"

Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling, and media sharing use it. In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default endto-end encrypted service. This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls, videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp version 2.16.2 (released April 2016). In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on its privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, which forms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protection against forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue that simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadata can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their patterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the security architecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocols used. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what further measures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability. We start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to be understood to properly understand security, (ii) the security architecture, (iii) security evaluation, (iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of the important concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating the architecture are - end-to-end encryption (E2EE), signal protocol, and curve25519.

We draw on the rational choice perspective to investigate how burglars select a target by relying on house-related attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk. It extends current applications of the discrete spatial choice framework to burglary target selection by adopting the house as the spatial unit of analysis and studies burglars' target selection process in a larger and more diverse study area than that of earlier studies. Using data on 650 residential burglaries and on approximately 500,000 residential properties in the Belgian province East Flanders, we consider a discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection to establish which house-related attributes influence burglars' target selection process. Our findings demonstrate that terraced houses, houses without a garage, houses that have not been outfitted with a central heating and/or air-conditioning system and houses nearby burglars' residences are more likely to be selected. Overall, our analysis suggests that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets while higher perceived rewards actually decrease the odds of a house being burglarized. Risk-related attributes are unimportant for burglars' target choice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Burglary; Crime; Discrete choice; Location choice; Rational choice perspective; Target selection","crime; discrete choice analysis; location decision; modeling; spatial analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941791776"

User authentication is an important step to protect information and in this context, face biometrics has more advantage. Face biometrics are natural, intuitive, easy to use and less human invasive. Unfortunately, recent work has face biometrics vulnerable to spoofing attacks using cheap low-tech equipment. We have introduced a method for face spoofing detection using spatiotemporal (dynamic texture) extensions of highly popular local binary pattern operator. With wide deployment, face recognition systems has been used in applications from border control to mobile device unlocking and laptop device unlocking. The combat of video spoofing attacks requires increased attention. We address the problem of video spoofing detection against replay attacks by using the aliasing analysis in spoofed face videos.

In this paper, we begin to address this omission by examining the kinds of problems residents in the city of Brisbane, Australia, are likely to encounter with neighbours and identifying patterns in their distribution on the basis of neighbourhood characteristics. Making a distinction between private nuisance problems on the one hand and antisocial and criminal behaviour on the other hand, we observe how neighbourhood levels of concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility and population density all increase the chances of residents encountering a combination of nuisance and antisocial or criminal neighbour problems over nuisance problems only or no problems at all. Conversely, a higher concentration of foreign-born residents is found to be associated with residents being more likely to experience nuisance or no problems over more criminal and antisocial forms. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","antisocial behaviour; crime; neighbourhoods; Neighbours; nuisance problems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928205984"

The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crime—illicit drug dealing in an open air drug market—and tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded.

Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders. Methods: Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders’ spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age. Results: Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders. Conclusions: This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Discrete spatial choice; Mixed logit; Offender mobility; Residential burglary","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938515452"

Moreover, the analysis of anonymized and aggregated large-scale human behavioral data offers new possibilities to understand global patterns of human behavior and helps decision makers tackle problems of societal importance. In this article, we highlight the potential societal benefits derived from big data applications with a focus on citizen safety and crime prevention. First, we introduce the emergent new research area of big data for social good. Next, we detail a case study tackling the problem of crime hotspot classification, that is, the classification of which areas in a city are more likely to witness crimes based on past data. In the proposed approach we use demographic information along with human mobility characteristics as derived from anonymized and aggregated mobile network data. The hypothesis that aggregated human behavioral data captured from the mobile network infrastructure, in combination with basic demographic information, can be used to predict crime is supported by our findings. Our models, built on and evaluated against real crime data from London, obtain accuracy of almost 70% when classifying whether a specific area in the city will be a crime hotspot or not in the following month. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.","big data analytics; crime; data mining; predictive analytics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991832961"

Market operators face the challenge of keeping their stores free from malicious apps, a task that has become increasingly complex as malware developers are progressively using advanced techniques to defeat malware detection tools. One such technique commonly observed in recent malware samples consists of hiding and obfuscating modules containing malicious functionality in places that static analysis tools overlook (e.g., within data objects). In this paper, we describe Alterdroid, a dynamic analysis approach for detecting such hidden or obfuscated malware components distributed as parts of an app package. The key idea in Alterdroid consists of analyzing the behavioral differences between the original app and a number of automatically generated versions of it, where a number of modifications (faults) have been carefully injected. Observable differences in terms of activities that appear or vanish in the modified app are recorded, and the resulting differential signature is analyzed through a pattern-matching process driven by rules that relate different types of hidden functionalities with patterns found in the signature. A thorough justification and a description of the proposed model are provided. The extensive experimental results obtained by testing Alterdroid over relevant apps and malware samples support the quality and viability of our proposal. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Computer security; Malware; Mobile computing","Computer crime; Mobile computing; Pattern matching; Security of data; Side channel attack; Smartphones; Static analysis; Analysis approach; Automatically generated; Data objects; Malware detection; Market operators; Smartphone malware; Malware","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963891446"

Drawing from current literature, we hypothesized that victimization would have a stronger effect on moving decisions for Whites than for Blacks or Hispanics, and that racial/ethnic residential segregation would moderate the impact of victimization on mobility. Using a longitudinal sample of 34,134 housing units compiled from the National Crime Victimization Survey for the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States (1995-2003), we found results that both support and contradict the hypotheses. Specifically, White residents display consistent evidence that victimization is a significant predictor of household mobility. Blacks and Hispanics, in contrast, are more varied in their moving behavior after victimization. In addition, significant differences exist among these groups in responses to victimization and in how mobility is influenced by residential segregation. Higher levels of residential segregation play a part in the victimization-mobility relationship among Blacks in a way that is more complex than we hypothesized. © 2014 American Society of Criminology.","Ethnicity; National crime victimization survey (NCVS); Race; Residential mobility; Victimization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925342140"

Methods: Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space–time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy. Results: Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons. Conclusions: Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this “invisible” Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment.

This literature review is separated into three major debates and focused on four major themes that consistently appear in the study of violent conflicts in the North Caucasus: nationalism and identity (grievance), criminality and opportunism (greed), repression (revenge and trauma), and religion (radicalization). The first debate concentrates on the structural factors explaining mass mobilization in the North Caucasus following the end of the Soviet Union. The second debate underscores the role of religious radicalization in mobilization patterns in Chechnya and the North Caucasus, as well as its potential links with other conflicts (Afghanistan and Syria) and the importance of suicide bombings. Finally, the third debate focuses on the study of counter-insurgency and counterterrorism, the development of the Caucasus Emirate, and the diffusion of insurgent violence across the region. The article concludes by underlining the need to engage on a larger theorization of violent mobilization in the North Caucasus seeking to integrate structural, organizational and individual variables linking the global dynamics and local specificities of the region. © 2015 International Association for the Study of the Caucasus.","Chechnya; Islam; North Caucasus; terrorism; violent mobilization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988829119"

Digital watermarking is promising technology to detect illegal replication or fabrication of such 2D codes. However, due to geometric distortions and/or interferences between patterns of camera sensors and screen pixels, watermark may not be sufficiently extracted from subbands which are used when embedding the watermark. This paper proposes a two-stage optimization method for watermark embedding and extracting scheme design. The proposed method discriminates frequency subbands between for embedding and extraction, whereas general watermarking schemes extract the watermark from the same subbands as while embedding. To evaluate actual image deterioration by digital-analogue conversion with mobile phone screen and camera, the proposed method uses actual mobile phones to obtain real images of valid and replicated 2D codes. Experimental result have shown that the proposed two-stage optimization of watermark embedding and extracting schemes improved watermark performance for 2D code replication detection.","Mobile phone; Two-dimensional barcode; Watermark optimization","Bar codes; Cameras; Cellular telephones; Cellular telephones; Crime; Deterioration; Digital watermarking; Extraction; Geometric distortion; Image deterioration; Replication detections; Two Dimensional (2 D); Two stage optimizations; Two-dimensional barcode; Watermark embedding; Watermarking schemes; Embeddings","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939545768"

The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders. Methods: Using a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences. Results: Findings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered – some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences.

It analyzes the commonalities and differences between a collection of crime reports in order to understand crime patterns and identify abnormal cases. A big challenge of CCA is the data processing and exploration. Traditional manual approach can no longer cope with the increasing volume and complexity of the data. In this paper we introduce a novel visual analytics system, Spherical Similarity Explorer (SSE) that automates the data processing process and provides interactive visualizations to support the data exploration.

Currently, it is impossible to detect and prevent all malware because the amount of new malware continues to increase exponentially; malware detection methods need to improve in order to respond quickly and effectively to malware. For the quick response, revealing the main purpose or functions of captured malware is important; however, only few recent works have attempted to find malware's main purpose. Our approach is designed to help with efficient and effective incident responses or countermeasure development by analyzing the main functions of malicious behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel method for function-oriented malware analysis approach based on analysis of suspicious API call patterns. Instead of extracting API call patterns for malware in each family, we focus on extracting such patterns for certain malicious functionalities. Our proposed method dumps memory sections where an application is allocated and extracts suspicious API sequences from bytecode by comparing with predefined suspicious API lists. By matching API call patterns with our functionality database, our method determines whether they are malicious. The experiment results demonstrate that our method performs well in detecting malware with high accuracy. © 2016 Jae-wook Jang and Huy Kang Kim.","","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Mobile devices; Effective incident response; High-accuracy; Malicious behavior; Malware analysis; Malware detection; Mobile malware; Quick response; Sensitive informations; Malware","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962285684"

There is a paucity of information on the government's mandatory TB notification order from the perspective of private medical practitioners (PPs). Objective: To understand the awareness, perception and barriers on TB notification among PPs in Chennai, India. Methods: Total of 190 PPs were approached in their clinics by trained field staff who collected data using a semi-structured and pre-coded questionnaire after getting informed consent. The data collected included PPs' specialization, TB management practices, awareness about the TB notification order, barriers in its implementation and their suggestions to improve notification. Results: Of 190 PPs from varied specializations, 138 (73%) had diagnosed TB cases in the prior three months, of whom 78% referred these patients to government facilities. Of 138 PPs, 73% were aware of the order on mandatory TB notification, of whom 46 (33%) had ever notified a TB case. Of 120 PPs, 63% reported reasons for not notifying TB cases. The main reasons reported for not notifying were lack of time (50%), concerns regarding patients' confidentiality (24%) and fear of offending patients (11%). Of 145 PPs, 76% provided feedback about information they felt uncomfortable reporting during notification. PPs felt most uncomfortable reporting patient's government-issued Aadhar number (77%), followed by patient's phone number (37%) and residential address (26%). The preferred means of notification was through mobile phone communication (24%), SMS (18%) and e-mail (17%). Conclusion: This study highlights that one-fourth of PPs were not aware of the TB notification order and not all those who were aware were notifying. While it is important to sensitize PPs on the importance of TB notification it is also important to understand the barriers faced by PPs and to make the process user-friendly in order to increase TB notification. © 2016 Thomas et al.

Mobile devices are being used for critical business tasks such as e-commerce, banking transactions, video conferences, email communications and confidential data storage. Companies are moving towards mobile-app-only strategies and advertisers are displaying ads on mobile apps as well. Mobile device ads can often reveal information such as location, gender, age and other valuable data about users.

The results show that the methodology can identify a user even if he or she uses the same device, multiple devices, different networks or follows different usage patterns.

Compared with group clustering or classification based on trajectory distance, the overlapping interference can be effectively avoided between members in different groups, and this method fits the objective law of group movement better.

This is mainly because signature-based features are very sensitive to the training data and cannot capture general behaviours of identified malware. To improve the robustness of classifiers, we study the problem of learning and verifying unwanted behaviours abstracted as automata. They are common patterns shared by malware instances but rarely seen in benign applications, e.g., intercepting and forwarding incoming SMS messages. We show that by taking the verification results against unwanted behaviours as input features, the classification performance of detecting new malware is improved dramatically. In particular, the precision and recall are respectively 8 and 51 points better than those using API calls and permissions, measured against industrial datasets collected across several years. Our approach integrates several methods: formal methods, machine learning and text mining techniques. It is the first to automatically generate unwanted behaviours for Android malware detection. We also demonstrate unwanted behaviours constructed for well-known malware families. They compare well to those described in human-authored descriptions of these families. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Machine learning; Malware detection; Mobile security; Software verification; Static analysis","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Data mining; Feature extraction; Formal methods; Formal verification; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile security; Static analysis; Verification; Android malware; Classification performance; Malware detection; Malware families; Precision and recall; Software verification; Text mining techniques; Verification results; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977470909"

Many real-life successful hacking attempts that enabled attackers to get unauthorized access to sensitive database entries including user passwords have been experienced in the past. Seizing password hashes, attackers perform brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow-table attacks to reveal plaintext passwords from their hashes. Dictionary attacks are very fast for cracking hashes but their success rate is not sufficient. In this paper, we propose a novel method for improving dictionary attacks. Our method exploits several password patterns that are commonly preferred by users when trying to choose a complex and strong password. In order to analyze and show success rates of our developed method, we performed cracking tests on real-life leaked password hashes using both a traditional dictionary and our pattern-based dictionary.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for safety support systems to prevent crimes against children or for antiloss, especially when parents are not with their children, such as to and from school. However, existing children's tracking systems are not smart enough to provide the safety supports, as they simply locate the children's positions without offering any notification to parents that their children may be in danger. In addition, there is limited research on children's tracking and their antiloss. In this article, based on location histories, we introduce novel notions of children's life patterns that capture their general lifestyles and regularities, and develop an intelligent data mining framework to learn the safe regions and safe routes of children on the cloud side. When the children may be in danger, their parents will receive automatic notifications from the cloud. Wealso propose an effective energy-efficient positioning scheme that leverages the location tracking accuracy of the children while keeping energy overhead low by using a hybrid global positioning system and a global system for mobile communications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in applying data mining techniques to applications designed for children's safety. Our proposed techniques have been incorporated into Soter, a children's safeguard system that is used to provide cloud service for smart bracelets produced by Qihoo.

This paper discusses the extent to which expectations of benefits and burdens were met or not met and how actual effects were distributed within and between the affected communities. Providing local benefits and mitigating potential damage to community wellbeing are critical to the social license to operate for the onshore gas industry. Methods: Findings were derived from assessment of priority indicators agreed on by representatives of the community, industry, and government. These indicators track population, income, employment, housing costs, and crime rates as well as rainfall and petrol prices from 2001 to the present. These data were combined with insights from interviews to yield a 'systems view' of the social and economic changes at the town level. This combination of aggregated data and local input enabled 'ground truthing' of the findings. Results: The benefits and burdens of CSG development are not evenly distributed town-by-town, household-by-household, business sector-by-business sector, or year-by-year. The heterogeneous pattern of outcomes reflects features of a booming resource industry, for example, the size of the workforce, differing skill requirements for the workforce associated with different phases of projects, location of project sites, and the number, pace and life cycle of each element of a project. While there are clear benefits in employment and business incomes, increased mobility and transience in the population can be seen to contribute to significant disruption to social networks, shared norms of behavior and values. Changes in the built environment, with the new buildings, new businesses, and new types of homes can affect residents' sense of identity and place. Although there are indications that communities are responding and adapting to social disruption during the construction phase of CSG development, it is important for the industry, government, and community to take measures to monitor and enhance social capital. Additive information: The CSG construction phase is now abating and the numbers of fly-in/fly-out workers declining. However, early in 2015, the industry reported that there were still on the order of a thousand wells per year to be drilled during the next 15 years. These figures can fluctuate, and they have since been revised down to around 600, coinciding with a drop in oil and gas prices and greater knowledge of the natural gas resources in the region. This scale of development occurs in an area covering approximately 40,000 square kilometres with 40,000 inhabitants. Questions remain about the degree to which the region - which also exports coal, wheat, and beef - will be subject to highs and lows as international gas prices fluctuate and geology reveals how much natural gas can be extracted in commercially viable quantities. Research to date indicates that the complexity of factors involved calls for considered strategies for ongoing monitoring of impacts and provision of information at the town level to enhance local capacity to service the industry, maintain wellbeing, and achieve regional development aspirations. Audiences: Implications can be drawn for managers of stakeholder, Indigenous, and community relations, government relations, media relations, and social performance as well as for staff and contractors on worksites, in communities, and on the road. Importantly, there are implications for local content policies, community investment by the industry, and regional development.

In order to address this gap, the paper at hand looks into the roles of mobile applications in supporting routines, and the related principles for mobile application design.

Activity spaces encompass a person’s anchor points – locations that are frequented regularly, such as home, work, school, and recreational areas – and the travel paths that connect them. Activity spaces of criminals are routinely mapped in order to better understand the spatial patterns and processes of crime at the individual level. Although many geographic information system-based methods have been used to map activity spaces over the years, potential path areas are becoming a preferred method since they incorporate both spatial and temporal data, as well as time budget and mobility constraints. This paper extends potential path areas for mapping activity spaces of criminals in two ways. First, time-geographic density estimation (TGDE) is used to estimate individual activity spaces using potential path areas that have associated probability densities. Second, activity spaces of numerous individuals are combined into a single intensity surface that maps areas of a city that are more frequented by offenders and, accordingly, expected to support higher crime rates. The approach is demonstrated using a dataset of home and work addresses of registered sex offenders in the city of St. Louis. The final density surface of their combined activity spaces is related to the locations of reported sex crimes. The results highlight how sex crimes are concentrated in offender activity spaces and suggest the approach might be useful for predictive policing. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","density estimation; hot spots; sex offenders; Time geography","Missouri; Saint Louis [Missouri]; United States; activity pattern; crime; GIS; mapping; spatial analysis; urban area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962680542"

It is frequently noticed that text password remains predominantly popular over the other formats of passwords, due to the fact that it is simple and expedient. However, text passwords are not always sturdy enough and are very easily stolen and misused under different vulnerabilities. Other persons can obtain a text password when a person creates a weak password or a password that is completely reused in many sites. In this condition if one password is hacked, it can be used for all the websites. This is called the Domino Effect. Another unsafe situation is when a person enters his/her password in a computer that is not trust-worthy; the password is prone to stealing attacks such as phishing, malware and key loggers etc. Among the most significant current threats to online banking are keylogging and phishing. These attacks extract user identity and account information to be used later for unauthorized access to user's financial accounts. This paper proposes a user authentication protocol which leverages a user's Android Smartphone and short message service to resist password stealing and password reuse attacks. This protocol only requires each participating website possesses a unique phone number and users only need to remember a long-term password for login on all websites. To provide more security to Android Smartphone, an additional method called color pattern screen locking is also proposed in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.","Authentication; Encryption and decryption; Network security; Password; password reuse attack; password stealing attack","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Cryptography; Embedded systems; Locks (fasteners); Malware; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Websites; Authentication protocols; Data and information; Encryption and decryption; Password; password reuse attack; password stealing attack; Short message services; User authentication protocols; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957037695"

Some of these attacks have characteristics of intelligence and can be modelled as a set of collaborating software components such as those used in intelligent agents. In this paper, we discuss a set of parameters useful for analyzing and characterizing potential advanced cyber threats and for helping cybersecurity experts prepare to defend against them. A set of intelligent agents can be designed to collaborate in order to solve a complex problem, each agent having its own set of knowledge and expertise and being able to respond to requests from other agents for help in solving the problem. An intelligent agent can contain or have access to knowledge about context (e.g. patterns of network traffic) or problem-solving and can use any of the artificial intelligence reasoning techniques that are available to larger, more comprehensive software modules. Some agents are mobile, that is they can move across a network to operate on multiple network nodes. These intelligent agent paradigms can represent advanced threats. For example, intelligent agents as individual intelligent software entities, as a collaborating set, or as a swarm with emergent intelligence could be used to model threats which manifest cyber tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). This paper includes an analysis of the design parameters of intelligent agent architectures and the implications of these parameter choices for agent behaviors that can be used for analyzing and testing systems for the purpose of learning to secure them against sophisticated cyber-attacks. In order to motivate and support this analysis we provide a scenario use case which envisions the use of advanced intelligent agent teams for analysis of possible threats and for cybersecurity testing. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Cyber security; Intelligent agents; Models","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computer crime; Crime; Human engineering; Malware; Mobile agents; Models; Network security; Problem solving; Software agents; Collaborating software; Cyber security; Design parameters; Intelligent agent architecture; Intelligent software; Multiple components; Multiple networks; Reasoning techniques; Intelligent agents","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986309428"

Smartphone thefts account for the largest percentage of thefts in recent crime statistics. Using a victim's smartphone, the attacker can launch impersonation attacks, which threaten the security of the victim and other users in the network. Our threat model includes the attacker taking over the phone after the user has logged on with his password or pin. Our goal is to design a mechanism for smartphones to better authenticate the current user, continuously and implicitly, and raise alerts when necessary. In this paper, we propose a multi-sensors-based system to achieve continuous and implicit authentication for smartphone users. The system continuously learns the owner's behavior patterns and environment characteristics, and then authenticates the current user without interrupting user-smartphone interactions. Our method can adaptively update a user's model considering the temporal change of user's patterns. Experimental results show that our method is efficient, requiring less than 10 seconds to train the model and 20 seconds to detect the abnormal user, while achieving high accuracy (more than 90%). Also the combination of more sensors provide better accuracy. Furthermore, our method enables adjusting the security level by changing the sampling rate.","Accelerometer; Android; Authentication; Magnetometer; Orientation sensor; Security; Sensors; Smartphone; Support vector machines","Accelerometers; Information systems; Information use; Magnetometers; Mobile security; Sensors; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Android; Environment characteristic; Impersonation attack; Implicit authentications; Orientation sensors; Security; Security and privacy; Smartphone securities; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84934969763"

Cloud computing is synonymous with virtualisation which is about creating virtual versions of the hardware platform, the operating system or the storage devices. Virtualisation is omnipresent in the cloud environment that poses challenges to implementation of security as well as cybercrime investigation. Techniques used in traditional digital forensics may not be appropriate for timely analysis of large capacity virtual hard disk files. Hence, there is a need for reducing analysis time for cloud crime cases like child pornography, financial frauds, etc. In this paper, we designed and developed a new 'real-time digital forensic analysis process' to minimise the overall processing time of evidence.

The campaign initially encouraged citizens to block the Central District, Hong Kong’s financial center. However, as the campaign evolved, large protests were organized all over Hong Kong. While vigorous clashes occurred between Occupy Central protesters and police officers on the streets of Hong Kong, cyber attacks were launched quietly by supporters of both sides against each other’s assets. The cyber weapons included mobile applications with malware for surveillance, tools for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and sophisticated phishing emails with advanced persistent threat functionality. This chapter presents information about cyber attacks related to the Occupy Central campaign and classifies the attacks based on their purpose, techniques, targets and propagation. Based on the attack classification and timeline, a framework is provided that helps predict attack patterns and behavior in order to prevent or mitigate attacks launched during similar political events. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.","Cyber attacks; Occupy Central campaign; Political events","Crime; Critical infrastructures; Denial-of-service attack; Law enforcement; Malware; Network security; Public works; Telecommunication networks; Attack classifications; Attack patterns; Cyber-attacks; Distributed denial of service attack; Mainland chinas; Mobile applications; Occupy Central campaign; Political events; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951870098"

In such scenario, some malicious nodes may try to intercept and manipulate the sensitive situational data with the intention of corruption and fraud. One way of preventing such corruption is to detect the malicious nodes based on their reputation and avoid them during data forwarding. In our earlier work [1], we proposed a dynamic reputation estimation technique where a group of trusted, independent, roving observer were assigned to specific affected zones. They randomly monitor, estimate the behavior of nodes in terms of their cooperation pattern as well as group-biasness and periodically publish a global node reputation matrix to help other nodes in selecting a suitable unselfish, unbiased and cooperative forwarder. In this paper, we suggested some improvement on the reputation collection mechanism proposed in our earlier work so that global reputation matrix can be generated quickly in a sparse network. In a post-disaster scenario, volunteers normally work around shelters; As a result, volunteers are found to be sparsely spread across the entire affected area. Observers, being unaware of the locations of volunteers or shelters, move around randomly within their designated zones to collect reputation of volunteers. Thus, the time taken to collect the reputation of all nodes in a specific zone is found to be quite large. Our objective, in this paper, is to adapt the mobility of an observer towards the more volunteer-rich areas in that zone so that maximum volunteers can be met in minimum time and the reputations may be collected quickly. Inspired by Ant colony based route selection algorithm we have implemented volunteer-concentration based adaptive mobility of the observers. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using ONE simulator [13]. © 2015 IEEE.","adaptive mobility; Ant colony algorithm; Delay Tolerant Network; Group-bias; Post-disaster communication network; Reputation estimation; Selfish node","Ant colony optimization; Crime; Disasters; Genetic algorithms; Matrix algebra; Smartphones; Ant colony algorithms; Group-bias; Post-disaster communications; Reputation estimation; Selfish node; Delay tolerant networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929402338"

In trust estimation phase, global trust value is estimated for each node in the chosen path based on direct and indirect trust values.

Human mobility patterns cause shifts in the baseline population, however, that can potentially influence the crime statistics. This study therefore employed an ambient population that combined residential population data with data depicting the commuting activity in small administrative areas. The effects of the commuter-harmonized ambient population on crime were then evaluated in a series of negative binomial regression models. The models also controlled for criminogenic factors and incorporated eigenvector spatial filtering to adjust for spatial effects. The results show significant effects of commuting patterns on crime outcomes. For certain crimes, such as violence, theft, and disorder, the inbound commuters are significantly associated with high risk. It was further discovered that an offset variable comprising the commuter-harmonized ambient population data models the crime outcomes more reliably than when residential population data are used. Spatial filtering was found to effectively eradicate residual spatial autocorrelation after accounting for effects of the predictor variables. We conclude that calculating crime rates using the residential population does not constitute an accurate risk measure and that the ambient population has crucial implications for realistic and reliable target representation and crime modeling. © 2016 by American Association of Geographers.","Ambient population; Criminogenic factors; Eigenvector spatial filtering; Regression","commuting; crime; eigenvalue; numerical model; population dynamics; regression analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971421837"

The collection of this data has raised the need to analyse or mine the data to deduce patterns that are helpful in addressing crime. Since data analytic expertises are limited in developing nations, outsourcing the data to a third-party service provider is a cost effective management strategy. However, crime data is inherently privacy sensitive and must be protected from ""honest-but-curious"" service providers. In order to speed up real time analysis of the data, streaming data can be used instead of static data. Streaming data anonymity schemes based on k-anonymity offer fast privacy preservation and query processing but are reliant on buffering schemes that incur high information loss rates on intermittent data streams. In this paper, we propose a scheme for adjusting the size of the buffer based on data arrival rates and use k-anonymity to enforce data privacy. Furthermore, in order to handle buffered records that are unanonymizable, we use a heuristic that works by either delaying the unanonymized record(s) to the next buffering cycle or incorporating the record(s) into a cluster of anonymized records with similar privacy constraints. The advantage of this approach to streaming-data anonymization is two-fold. First, we ensure privacy of the data through k-anonymization, and second, we ensure minimal information loss from the unanonymized records thereby, offering the opportunity for high query result accuracy on the anonymized data. Results from our prototype implementation demonstrate that our proposed scheme enhances privacy for data analytics. With varied data privacy requirement levels, we incur an average information loss in delay of 1.95% compared to other solutions that average a loss of 12.7%.","Crime reporting; Data anonymity; Information loss; K-anonymity; Privacy enhancing model; Streaming data","Cost effectiveness; Crime; Data acquisition; Data Analytics; Developing countries; Information systems; Information use; Outsourcing; Crime reporting; Data anonymity; Information loss; K-Anonymity; Streaming data; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938781050"

We propose to collect an application's network behavior and interaction to characterize application behaviors. An integrated testbed system has been designed and prototyped for such network behavior collection, with a scenario simulator generating system and user events to trigger application behaviors. Statistical features are derived from application network traffic. The sequences of triggering events and network behavior features are further fed to a recurrent neural network to learn and construct one general model for each typical category of mobile applications. Experiments show that applications in each category with similar functionality exhibit consistent network behavior patterns. Malware behaviors, on the other hand, deviate apparently from the expected event-behavior patterns of the claimed categories. This finding is suitable for evaluating and measuring unknown mobile applications to predict risk and trustworthiness. © 2015 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Open systems; Recurrent neural networks; Application behaviors; Application networks; Behavior consistency; Consistent network; Malicious activities; Malware behaviors; Mobile applications; Statistical features; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964857783"

Currently there is little in the way of age-specific service provision for elderly offenders despite their high degree of chronic physical and mental health need. In contrast to other offenders, this group is more likely to have mobility needs as well as a different pattern of social and custodial problems. Research into this area is limited, though growing, particularly in the US and UK, with some interesting developments being made. A strong evidence-base is needed to inform national and international policy about how best to care for and manage older offenders. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.","Acute mental health; Elderly prisoner; Male prisoner; Prison population; Restorative justice","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068883069"

While previous work has been mainly focused on devising adversary-aware classification algorithms to counter evasion attempts, only few authors have considered the impact of using reduced feature sets on classifier security against the same attacks. An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks. Inspired by previous work on adversary-aware classifiers, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection model that can improve classifier security against evasion attacks, by incorporating specific assumptions on the adversary's data manipulation strategy. We focus on an efficient, wrapper-based implementation of our approach, and experimentally validate its soundness on different application examples, including spam and malware detection. © 2015 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; classifier security; evasion attacks; feature selection; malware detection; spam filtering","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Internet; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile security; Pattern recognition; Application examples; Classification algorithm; Data manipulations; Feature sets; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Security properties; Test time; Feature extraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928252929"

Objective: To study the uses and crime control impacts of mobile computing technology in the context of geographically focused “hot spots” patrols. Research Design: An experiment was conducted using 18 crime hot spots in a suburban jurisdiction. Nine of these locations were randomly selected to receive additional patrols over 11 weeks. Researchers studied officers’ use of mobile information technology (IT) during the patrols using activity logs and interviews. Nonrandomized subgroup and multivariate analyses were employed to determine if and how the effects of the patrols varied based on these patterns. Results: Officers used mobile computing technology primarily for surveillance and enforcement (e.g., checking automobile license plates and running checks on people during traffic stops and field interviews), and they noted both advantages and disadvantages to its use. Officers did not often use technology for strategic problem-solving and crime prevention. Given sufficient (but modest) dosages, the extra patrols reduced crime at the hot spots, but this effect was smaller in places where officers made greater use of technology. Conclusions: Basic applications of mobile computing may have little if any direct, measurable impact on officers’ ability to reduce crime in the field. Greater training and emphasis on strategic uses of IT for problem-solving and crime prevention, and greater attention to its behavioral effects on officers, might enhance its application for crime reduction. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","experiment; hot spots; mobile computing; policing; technology","Crime; Female; Humans; Law Enforcement; Male; Mobile Applications; Police; Program Evaluation; Social Control, Formal; crime; female; human; law enforcement; male; mobile application; organization and management; police; prevention and control; program evaluation; social control; statistics and numerical data; utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963652543"

We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network.

This approach is to extract wavelet-based features from sensor pattern noise which are then classified using a support vector machine.

Based on a case study of Haitian residents deported between 1989 and 2009, I argue that criminal deportation cannot be explained as a stable proportion of the pool of permanent residents, but rather in terms of the political attention it generates. A change-point analysis identified two separate political mobilization phases. During the first phase (1994-1998), the integration of long-term residents is defined as a political issue and is translated into legislation (Bill C-44). The second phase (2003-2005) is a new episode of expansion that reformulated the issue around the concepts of risk and efficiency (Bill C-11). Despite recent legal reforms designed to accelerate removals of foreign criminals (Bills C-43 and C-60), the arrival of the Conservative Party (2006-2009) coincided with a decrease in criminal deportations during the period under review. © 2016 Canadian Political Science Association (l'Association canadienne de science politique).","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954508901"

Since the Android platform has taken the dominant position in smartphone popularity, the number of Android malware has grown correspondingly and represents critical threat to the smartphone users. This rise in malware is primarily attributable to the occurrence of variants of existing malware. A set of variants stem from one malware can be considered as one malware family, and malware families cover more than half of the Android malware population. A conventional technique for defeating malware is the use of signature matching which is efficient from a time perspective but not very practical because of its lack of robustness against the malware variants. As a counter approach for handling the issue of variants behavior analysis techniques have been proposed but require extensive time and resources. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection mechanism that uses automated family signature extraction and family signature matching. Key concept of the mechanism is to extract a set of family representative binary patterns from evaluated family members as a signature and to classify each set of variants into a malware family via an estimation of similarity to the signatures. The proposed family signature and detection mechanism offers more flexible variant detection than does the legacy signature matching, which is strictly dependent on the presence of a specific string. Furthermore, compared with the previous behavior analysis techniques considering family detection, the proposed family signature has higher detection accuracy without the need for the significant overhead of data and control flow analysis. Using the proposed signature, we can detect new variants of known malware efficiently and accurately by static matching. We evaluated our mechanism with 5846 real world Android malware samples belonging to 48 families collected in April 2014 at an anti-virus company; experimental results showed that; our mechanism achieved greater than 97% accuracy in detection of variants. We also demonstrated that the mechanism has a linear time complexity with the number of target applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Android; Family signature; Malware; Smartphone security; Static analysis; Variant detection","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Mobile security; Network security; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Static analysis; Viruses; Android; Control flow analysis; Conventional techniques; Family signature; Linear time complexity; Signature extraction; Smart-phone applications; Smartphone securities; Malware","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924898377"

Moreover, the continuous emerging of new and sophisticated malware makes current solutions to protect mobile phones inadequate shortly after being implemented. In this paper a new approach for run-time malware detection is proposed. It consists in analyzing system call traces gathered from malware and trusted applications to identify a set of relationships and recurring execution patterns that characterize their respective behavior. The characterization of the malware behaviour is expressed in terms of declarative constraints between system calls and can be used to identify similarities across malware families, detect malware variants within the same family, and to build trees of malware families based on their similarities. The effectiveness and efficiency of the approach have been assessed using a dataset of more than 1500 between trusted and malicious applications across six malware families. The results show that the proposed approach exhibits a very good discriminating ability exploitable for both malware detection and the study of malware evolution. © 2016 IEEE.","constraint languages; declarative process models; Declare; dynamic analysis; malware detection; ProM; Software security","Cellular telephones; Computer crime; Dynamic analysis; Intrusion detection; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; PROM; Telephone sets; Constraint language; Declarative process models; Declare; Malware detection; Software security; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015218457"

The term ""crime scene"", which got widespread into common language, depicts all the elements collected at the place where a crime occurred and which could later become pieces of evidence. However, the place by itself, the link between the offender and the place, the influence of the urban environment and the cultural aspect of it do not receive that much attention in the literature. This paper originates from a comparison of the work of two psychologists specialized within the field of geoprofiling, D. Canter and K. Rossmo, the latter being a Canadian citizen and the former an Englishman. If their postulates were similar, their findings however diverged. If primary caretakers and early interactions are not to be underestimated regarding their roles into the personality development, we will in these pages consider the urban environment by itself in serial sexual offenses. Methods: Due to a restricted access to this type of patients, we mainly focused our hypothesis on a literature review and a few patients of ours, met during previous research works. Concepts used in this paper overlap various fields such as psychodynamic, criminology, criminalistics, psycho-sociology and even urbanism. We focused in this paper onto the importance of the culture and the urban concrete environment as probable variables explaining these discrepancies observed into the behavioral patterns and distances covered by Serial Sex Offenders between the two shores of the Atlantic. The underlying question being how their space conception, their ""mental maps"", depends of the culture they were bred in and how it could have an incident onto their offense zones? Results: The findings highlight an inherently cultural variation of the spatial conception, but also how the space is built up and integrated between the USA (and all the large and historically ""recents"" territories) and Europe. American sexual serial offenders are more likely to cover larger distances, almost twice as much than their European counterparts. It seems that our hypothesis is relevant; a cultural distinction may exist on the way spatial environment is perceived and could thus have incidences into the offense patterns. Conclusions: With the development of the E.U., our spatial conceptions as European citizens evolve. Thanks to mass transportation, and the Erasmus programs, it is not uncommon for an Italian individual to study in Scotland or Finland for instance. This is of some importance into how the spatial mobility is becoming more thinkable, and somehow how it induces a shrinkage of the distance into the mental mapping process. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Culture; Environment; Offender; Psychological profile; Topography","Article; criminal behavior; criminology; cultural factor; Finland; human; mental health; psychodynamics; sexual crime; topography; United Kingdom; urban area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983189187"

However, research has shown that choosing the appropriate denominator is non-trivial. Different crime types exhibit different spatial opportunities and so does the population at risk. The residential population is the most commonly used population at risk, but is unlikely to be suitable for crimes that involve mobile populations. In this article, we use ""crowd-sourced"" data in Leeds, England, to measure the population at risk, considering violent crime. These new data sources have the potential to represent mobile populations at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than other available data. Through the use of two local spatial statistics (Getis-Ord GI∗ and the Geographical Analysis Machine) and visualization, we show that when the volume of social media messages, as opposed to the residential population, is used as a proxy for the population at risk, criminal event hot spots shift spatially. Specifically, the results indicate a significant shift in the city center, eliminating its hot spot. Consequently, if crime reduction/prevention efforts are based on resident population based crime rates, such efforts may not only be ineffective in reducing criminal event risk, but be a waste of public resources. © 2014 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.","population at risk; spatial crime analysis; twitter; violent crime","Crime; Housing; Risk assessment; Social networking (online); Geographical analysis; Public resources; Residential population; Social media datum; Spatial and temporal resolutions; spatial crime analysis; Spatial statistics; twitter; Population statistics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988285613"

At present, the vehicle usage is basic necessity for everyone. Simultaneously, protecting the vehicle against theft is also very important. Traditional vehicle security system depends on many sensors and cost is also high. When the vehicle is stolen, no more response or alternative could be available to help the owner of the vehicle to find it back. The main goal of this paper is to protect the vehicle from any unauthorized access, using fast, easy-to-use, clear, reliable and economical fingerprint recognition technique. This vehicle security system intimates the status of the vehicle to the authoritative person (owner) using Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication technology. If the person is certified, vehicle access is allowed. Else SMS will be sent to the owner and the engine will be immobilized. The prototype model for the security system is built on the embedded platform using PIC Microcontroller which controls all the processes and cost is also very stumpy. On higher end theft attempts like cutting battery power supply, protection to the vehicle is provided by Engine Control Unit (ECU) embedded on microcontroller. By using GPS technology, vehicle can be identified very easily. Thus, the system provides security at both levels, i.e. when battery supply is provided or not. © 2015 The Authors.

With the emergence of the first large-scale mobile botnets, the core network has also become vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service attacks such as the signaling attack. Furthermore, complementary access methods such as Wi-Fi and femtocells introduce additional vulnerabilities for the mobile users as well as the core network. In this paper, we present the NEMESYS approach to smart mobile network security. The goal of the NEMESYS project is to develop novel security technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem, and to improve mobile network security through a better understanding of the threat landscape. To this purpose, NEMESYS will collect and analyze information about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting smart mobile devices and the core network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We are developing a data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots and honeyclients in order to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile attacks and understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile devices.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network. © 2015 IEEE.","agents; intrusion detection; networks","Agents; Computer crime; Information science; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Networks (circuits); Agent based; Central nodes; Intelligent mobile agent; Intrusion Detection Systems; Log file; PlanetLab; Security policy; Virtual networks; Mobile agents","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945253051"

Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing “eyes on the street” and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events. The article explains each theory, discusses the spatial scale at which the dynamics operate, highlights gaps in the current body of knowledge, and proposes a two-pronged research path forward. © 2014 SAGE Publications.","crime events; informal social control; opportunity; social disorganization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921058961"

Consequently, the requirements for managing these enormous datasets have increased drastically, so trajectory management has become an active research field. In order to avoid querying raw trajectories, which is neither convenient nor efficient, a symbolic representation of the geometric data has been introduced. A comprehensive framework for describing and querying symbolic trajectories including an expressive pattern language as well as an efficient matching algorithm was presented lately. A symbolic trajectory, basically being a time- dependent symbolic value (e.g., a label), can contain names of traversed roads, a speed profile, transportation modes, behaviors of animals, or cells inside a cellular network. The quality and efficiency of transportation systems, targeted advertising, animal research, crime investigation, etc. may be improved by analyzing such data. The main contribution of this paper is an improvement of our previous approach, featuring algorithms and data structures optimizing the matching of symbolic trajectories for any kind of pattern with the help of two indexes. More specifically, a trie is applied for the symbolic values (i.e., labels or places), while the time intervals are stored in a one-dimensional R-tree. Hence, we avoid the linear scan of every trajectory, being necessary without index support. As a result, the computation cost for the pattern matching is nearly independent from the trajectory size. Our work details the concept and the implementation of the new approach, followed by an experimental evaluation.

The force attributed to molding the copper wire into the terminal is a significant portion of the total force needed to form the crimp. Therefore, any wire deviation from the norm is translated into a force pattern aberration that can be detected using basic signal pattern analysis. As the mobility industry is contemplating replacing copper with aluminum wire, in order to save on weight and material cost, the traditional force monitoring becomes ineffective in detecting wire faults in the crimp. The reason is that aluminum is softer than copper, and most of the force exerted during the crimp cycle is consumed by forming the copper terminal itself. The small force deviation due to an aluminum wire fault becomes much more difficult to detect. Therefore, a new technique is needed to monitor crimped aluminum wires. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using ultrasound technology to monitor a crimp press cycle in order to separate a normal from a faulty crimp.

Unfortunately, as the number of threats grows continuously, the number of malware signatures grows proportionally. This is time consuming and leads to expensive computation costs, especially for mobile devices where memory, power and computation capabilities are limited. As the security threat level is getting worse, parallel computation capabilities for mobile phones is getting better with the evolution of mobile graphical processing units (GPUs). In this paper, we discuss how we can benefit from the evolving parallel processing capabilities of mobile devices in order to accelerate malware detection on Android mobile phones. We have designed and implemented a parallel host-based anti-malware for mobile devices that exploits the computation capabilities of mobile GPUs. A series of computation and memory optimization techniques are proposed to increase the detection throughput. The results suggest that mobile graphic cards can be used effectively to accelerate malware detection for mobile phones. © 2015 IEEE.","Malware detection; Multi-pattern matching; Parallel processing; Trace analysis of mobile phones","Cellular telephones; Computer crime; Distributed computer systems; Graphics processing unit; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Network security; Pattern matching; Pattern recognition; Program processors; Smart cards; Telephone sets; Trace analysis; Computation costs; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Malware detection; Memory optimization; Multi-pattern matching; Parallel Computation; Parallel processing; Security threats; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019476052"

The current study examines the effect of sexual murderers’ organized behaviors on their ability to both delay and/or avoid police detection. Using a combination of negative binomial and logistic regression analyses on a sample of 350 sexual murder cases, findings showed that although both measures of delaying and avoiding detection are positively correlated, different behavioral patterns were observed. For instance, offenders who moved the victim’s body were more likely to avoid detection but the victim’s body was likely to be recovered faster. Moreover, victim characteristics have an impact on both measures; however, this effect disappears for the measure of delaying detection once the organized behaviors are introduced.

This paper presents a novel and convenient way of accurately specifying malicious behavior in mobile environments by taking Android as a representative platform of analysis and implementation. Our specification takes a sequence-based approach in declaratively formulating a malicious action, whereby any two consecutive security-sensitive operations are connected by either a control or taint flow. It also captures the invocation context of an operation within an app’s component type and lifecycle/callback method. Additionally, exclusion of operations that are invoked from UI-related callback methods can be specified to indicate an action’s stealthy execution portions. We show how the specification is sufficiently expressive to describe malicious patterns that are commonly exhibited by mobile malware. To show the usefulness of the specification, and to demonstrate that it can derive stable and distinctive patterns of existing Android malware, we develop a static analyzer that can automatically check an app for numerous security-sensitive actions written using the specification. Given a target app’s uncovered behavior, the analyzer associates it with a collection of known malware families. Experiments show that our obfuscation-resistant analyzer can associate malware samples with their correct family with an accuracy of 97.2 %, while retaining the ability to differentiate benign apps from the profiled malware families with an accuracy of 97.6 %. These results positively show how the specification can lend to robust mobile malware detection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Behavior specification; Malware detection; Mobile security","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Mobile security; Security of data; Security systems; Specifications; Android malware; Behavior specifications; Malicious behavior; Malware detection; Malware families; Mobile environments; Robust detection; Static analyzers; Malware","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951856436"

However, in such settings, they have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including the deliberate manipulation of data at test time to evade detection. In this work, we focus on the vulnerability of linear classifiers to evasion attacks. This can be considered a relevant problem, as linear classifiers have been increasingly used in embedded systems and mobile devices for their low processing time and memory requirements. We exploit recent findings in robust optimization to investigate the link between regularization and security of linear classifiers, depending on the type of attack. We also analyze the relationship between the sparsity of feature weights, which is desirable for reducing processing cost, and the security of linear classifiers. We further propose a novel octagonal regularizer that allows us to achieve a proper trade-off between them. Finally, we empirically show how this regularizer can improve classifier security and sparsity in real-world application examples including spam and malware detection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Learning systems; Malware; Optimization; Syntactics; Application examples; Linear classifiers; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Memory requirements; Processing costs; Processing time; Robust optimization; Pattern recognition","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996636557"

Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments. © The Author(s) 2014.","discrete spatial choice; offender mobility; replication; residential burglary","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920645553"

The success of fingerprints in forensic science and law enforcement applications, coupled with growing concerns related to border control, financial fraud and cyber security, has generated a huge interest in using fingerprints, as well as other biological traits, for automated person recognition. It is, therefore, not surprising to see biometrics permeating various segments of our society. Applications include smartphone security, mobile payment, border crossing, national civil registry and access to restricted facilities. Despite these successful deployments in various fields, there are several existing challenges and new opportunities for person recognition using biometrics. In particular, when bio- metric data is acquired in an unconstrained environment or if the subject is uncooperative, the quality of the ensuing biometric data may not be amenable for automated person recognition. This is particularly true in crime-scene investigations, where the biological evidence gleaned from a scene may be of poor quality. In this article, we first discuss how biometrics evolved from forensic science and how its focus is shifting back to its origin in order to address some challenging problems. Next, we enumerate the similarities and differences between biometrics and forensics. We then present some applications where the principles of biometrics are being successfully leveraged into forensics in order to solve critical problems in the law enforcement domain. Finally, we discuss new collaborative opportunities for researchers in bio- metrics and forensics, in order to address hitherto unsolved problems that can benefit society at large. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion, Revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data. The experiments show the capability of CrimAnalyzer in identifying crime-related phenomena. © 2015 IEEE Computer Society.

Further, in searches using data from the smartphones to gather evidence, evidence must be collected and analyzed quickly. Therefore, in this paper, a method is proposed for rapidly collecting data at a crime scene based on the type of criminal charge.

Many serious challenges threatened its cohesion, such as the Suez crisis in 1956, the disputes over the so-called double-track decision in 1979, and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1993. While the history of the alliance has often been told as a history of crises (e.g. Stanley Hoffman, 1981), neither internal disputes over the war in Iraq nor the disappearance of a ‘communist threat’ have led to a break-up of NATO. The transatlantic alliance lives on. It has even expanded in size and tasks after the end of the Cold War. Recent tensions between ‘the West’ and Russia over Crimea and Ukraine make clear that the Atlantic alliance is anything but dead. As Stephen Walt put it: ‘NATO owes Putin a big thank-you’ (Walt, 2014). In International Relations (IR), debates on the Atlantic alliance have witnessed ups and downs as well. While realist, liberal, and institutionalist scholars strove to explain the existence and persistence of NATO by referring either to an alliance against threat (Walt, 1990, 1997), an alliance of democracies (Risse-Kappen, 1995, Risse, 1996), or a security manager (Wallander, 2000), other approaches have advocated a more critical and reflective understanding of the discourses and practices which constitute(d) the alliance in the first place (Klein, 1990; Bially Mattern, 2005; Behnke, 2013; Hellmann, 2006; Jackson 2003; Neumann and Williams, 2000; Pouliot, 2010; Adler, 2008). NATO’s lasting ability to overcome internal and external challenges to its cohesion, I will argue, directs our attention exactly to the discursive practices which enabled a continuous re-constitution of a Western security community. By re-constitution I refer to the Janus-faced process of activating and transforming foundational narratives which justify the existence and continuity of NATO. This process commonly includes constructions of threats and a sense of a shared identity which are both ingrained in symbolic orders and mobilized by articulations of a common security strategy. Of further interest, therefore, is how the allies answered the question why NATO should exist, how they invented and used a common notion of identity, interests, and threats in order to justify a deep and lasting pattern of military cooperation between North America and (Western) European states. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048401774"

This suggests that the potential for intentional exploitation of unsuspecting users is an ongoing issue, and finding anomalies in telecommunications data can aide in the security of users, their phones, their personal information, and the companies that provide them services. Most anomaly detection approaches applied to this type of data use some type of statistical representation; however, we think that a more natural representation is to consider telecom traffic as a graph. In this paper, we specifically focus on using graphbased anomaly detection to find and report anomalies in telecom data. Up until now, little work seems to be focused on detecting and reporting anomalies in telecommunications data represented as a graph. Moreover, even less work seems to focus on detecting anomalies in phone call history with this same representation. Our goal in this application paper is to use real-world cell phone traffic to detect anomalies in user patterns based on phone call and text message history.

A biochemistry/molecular biology-based subarea of forensic analysis, forensic serology, deals with the complex task of gathering information on the type of sample, age, origin, or sex from biological fluids found at a crime scene. Forensic serology relies on two methods: immunoassays and DNA/RNA analysis. This chapter reviews biochemical analysis of biomarkers and these methods are exemplified with the analysis of the ethnicity and sex of crime suspects, as well as the determination of blood sample age. Knowing the difference in the concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood of healthy adults of two ethnic groups, Caucasian (CA) and African American (AA), and taking into account the distribution pattern, the authors mimicked the samples of different ethnic origins with appropriate CK/LDH concentrations. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Such storms can result from malware and mobile botnets, as well as from poorly designed applications, and can cause service outages in 3G and 4G networks, which have been experienced by mobile operators. Since the radio resource control (RRC) protocol in the 3G and 4G networks is particularly susceptible to such storms, we analyze their effect with a mathematical model that helps to predict the congestion that is caused by a storm. A detailed simulation model of a mobile network is used to better understand the temporal dynamics of user behavior and signaling in the network and to show how RRC-based signaling attacks and storms cause significant problems in both the control and user planes of the network.

The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. Our study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. Our findings indicate that individuallevel characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs.

While a number of adversary-aware learning algorithms have been proposed, they are computationally demanding and aim to counter specific kinds of adversarial data manipulation. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing a multiple classifier system capable of improving security against evasion attacks at test time by learning a decision function that more tightly encloses the legitimate samples in feature space, without significantly compromising accuracy in the absence of attack. Since we combine a set of one-class and two-class classifiers to this end, we name our approach one-and-a-halfclass (1.5C) classification. Our proposal is general and it can be used to improve the security of any classifier against evasion attacks at test time, as shown by the reported experiments on spam and malware detection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Computer crime; Internet; Learning algorithms; Mobile security; Data manipulations; Decision functions; Feature space; Malware detection; Multiple classifier systems; Pattern classifier; Test time; Two-class classifier; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937460019"

Herein we describe the sexual behaviors, estimate prevalence of anal intercourse (AI) among truck drivers (“truckers”) and their wives, and determine partner-specific demographic and behavioral correlates of AI. We carried out a cluster-sampled cross-sectional survey among 18–49 year-old wives and their trucker husbands in a south Indian district. Data were collected by same-gender research team members with color-coded computer-assisted interviews. We used random intercept logistic regression to identify the independent correlates of AI. Thirteen percent of 475 wives and 467 truckers reported ever having AI with their spouse. Of those who responded, 55 % of 40 wives and 47 % of 36 truckers never used condoms during AI. Of those who responded, 22 of 32 wives and 24 of 32 husbands felt that condoms were unnecessary during AI. Reporting ever having AI was associated with younger age and higher education of both husband and wife. AI reported by wives was associated with having sexual partner(s) other than husband (adjusted OR 8.8 [95 % CI 3.2–24.0]), correctly answering all HIV knowledge items (adjusted OR 4.9 [95 % CI 1.9–12.5]), husband’s sexual debut occurring before marriage (adjusted OR 1.9 [95 % CI 1.0–3.5]), and husband’s high HIV risk perception (adjusted OR 2.5 [95 % CI 1.2–5.4]). AI reported by truckers was associated with having sex with a male or transgender (adjusted OR 4.0 [95 % CI 1.2–13.3]). Reported prevalence of AI was high considering that in India anal sex is non-normative, heavily stigmatized and, criminal.

The static analysis process involves several steps such as n-gram analysis of dex files, de-compilation of the App, pattern search, and analysis of the AndroidManifest file; (ii) a dynamic analysis sandbox that executes Android Apps in a controlled virtual environment, which logs low-level interactions with the operating system. The effectiveness of the developed framework is confirmed by testing it on popular Apps collected from F-Droid, and malware samples obtained from a third party and the Android Malware Genome Project dataset. As a case study, we show how the analysis reports obtained from AndroSAT can be used for studying the frequency of use of different Android permissions and dynamic operations, detection of Android malware, and for generating cyber intelligence about domain names involved in mobile malware activities.","Android Security; Dynamic Analysis; Static Analysis","Computer crime; Dynamic analysis; Frequency domain analysis; Malware; Mobile security; Security systems; Static analysis; Statistical tests; Virtual reality; Analysis process; Android applications; Android securities; Application installations; Dynamic operations; Frequency of use; Security analysis tools; Security aspects; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924370881"

Specifically, the paper analyzes how the website of the Phoenix-based Arizona Republic newspaper, azcentral.com, constructed the assault and its aftermath, focusing on what framing suggested about the causes of the crime and the role of identity discourses about gender, class, race, nation, and age. Findings suggest two dominant frames that blame the crime and its aftermath on Liberian culture by mobilizing identity discourse to construct youthful male Liberian refugees as violent ""others,"" and by suggesting that gang rape and victim-blaming are alien to American culture. A less prevalent frame counters the cultural explanation, pointing instead to individual responsibility. To some extent, dominant framing implicates social structures as a cause of rape, but overemphasizes race and nation to mask how they intersect with gender and age, thereby constructing the story in ways that support public anxiety about refugees more than progressive reforms to alleviate gender violence. The conclusions suggest that the frames identified follow established patterns for news constructions of gender violence involving young perpetrators of color. Thus, the study adds a new dimension to recent research likening online newspapers to their print predecessors in ways that reveal a cautious approach to the embrace of the innovative possibilities of internet-based news. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","gang rape; masculinity; online news; race; refugee; youth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886445737"

Unfortunately, this market-centric model is affected by several major security and trust issues, due to the fact that anyone can easily create, and deploy through the market, a malicious app that could potentially lead to a massive malware spread. In this paper, we propose a framework to classify Android malware based upon the concept of common patterns of actions executed by malicious applications. The basic idea is to extract, from known malware, a subset of frequent subgraphs of system calls that are executed by most of the malware. This set of subgraphs constitutes a database of known malicious features. Then, when a new application is downloaded from a market, it is first run in a sandbox to monitor its behavior. This will result in an execution trace that may contain some of the subgraphs previously found in malware.

An implementation of a specialised receiver software allows passive monitoring of GSM traffic along with physical layer burst extraction even for handover and frequency hopping techniques. We introduce time-based patterns of modulation errors as a unique device-dependent feature and carefully remove random effects of the wireless communication channel.

Nonetheless, detection of HTTP botnets is still a real challenge. Botmasters currently implement multiple techniques to hide their activity within the large amount of network traffic. On the other hand, although malware HTTP headers include multiple anomalies, little are being accounted for during detection. This paper analyzes anomalies in the HTTP user agent header field within malware traffic. It presents a taxonomy of malware user agent anomalies and uses this taxonomy in order to propose an appropriate detection mechanism. We observe, within a large set of malware HTTP traffic, that almost one malware out of eight uses a suspicious user agent header in at least one HTTP request. User agent anomalies are still being manually analyzed, whereas thousands of new malware samples are collected daily. This paper shows that a deeper analysis of malware user agents can reveal valuable detection patterns. It uses these patterns to automatically classify user agent anomalies and to extract signatures for malware detection. Our experimental results show that this solution provides a new mechanism that detects yet unknown malware by the time of building the signatures, while also satisfying a very low false positives rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Four significant factors are identified that alone or in combination appear to impact on the frequency with which these men experience police contact and custody, including young age at first police contact, experiencing out of home care as a child, alcohol misuse, and limited locational mobility. Whilst it might be expected that the presence of mental ill-health and/or cognitive disability would be a key predictor of the frequency and intensity of police contact and custody, the findings suggest rather that the presence of multiple disadvantages beginning in the early years and compounding throughout individuals' lives, in which mental illness may or may not be a factor, is more significant than the presence of any one diagnosis in precipitating police contact and custody for this group. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive disability; Complex needs; Indigenous Australians; Mental disorders; Police contact; Police custody","Adolescent; Adult; Crisis Intervention; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Law Enforcement; Male; Mentally Ill Persons; Middle Aged; New South Wales; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Police; Prisoners; Vulnerable Populations; adult; age; alcohol abuse; alcohol intoxication; article; Australia; cognitive defect; detention; drug abuse; home care; human; Indigenous Australian; juvenile delinquency; male; mental disease; mental health; police; adolescent; crisis intervention; health service; law enforcement; mental patient; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; prisoner; psychology; vulnerable population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901596255"

It is argued that a judicial reading of the situation gained prominence, both because of activist mobilisation outside Sudan and because the UN Security Council failed to agree on a more robust “responsibility to protect” approach. The externalisation of the issue of accountability for crimes in Darfur had several consequences. In addition to contributing to a lack of local ownership of justice, the recasting of complex local patterns of conflict in the moral vocabulary of a western judicial system simplified complexities on the ground. The arrest warrant was also issued at a time when international actors were pursuing a number of policy objectives in Sudan, including the implementation of the peace agreement between the government and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM). Combining a confrontational approach with a cooperative one has turned out to be extremely difficult, and the arrest warrant has exposed growing divisions among members of the international community, both regarding the response to atrocities in Darfur and regarding the purpose and priorities of the ICC. © 2013, © Universitetsforlaget 2013.","Darfur; Human Rights; ICC; Peace-Building; Sudan; Transitional Justice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992635362"

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a random sample of approximately 1,200 residents nested in 30 neighborhoods in Guangzhou, China. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for the data analysis. Findings: First, the majority of residents in Guangzhou held generally positive attitudes toward the police. Second, demographic characteristics were weakly related to satisfaction with police. Third, perception of police legitimacy was associated with evaluations of police performance. Finally, perceived neighborhood crime problems led to lower levels of satisfaction with police. Research limitations/implications: This research used cross-sectional data. Thus, the relationships between independent and dependent variables examined in this study are functional but not necessarily causal. Practical implications: Police in Guangzhou should seek ways to improve their relationship with never married residents and mitigate citizens' negative perceptions of neighborhood crime problem through various community policing programs, such as holding routine meetings with residents to discuss crime and disorder situations in the neighborhoods. Police in Guangzhou should also continue to inform local residents about the legal right of police to issue commands and increase levels of perceptions of police legitimacy and willingness to follow police instructions. Originality/value: This is the first paper to examine the correlates of satisfaction with Chinese police at the individual and neighborhood levels simultaneously. Using a random survey of citizens, along with methodological improvement in measurement and modeling, this paper provides readers with more accurate and representative information about public evaluations of Chinese police than previous studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Crime control; Police; Public opinion; Residential mobility; Satisfaction with police","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868013738"

In particular the chapter explores how physical artifacts that are based on data extracted from computer generated virtual spaces are being created as a way of challenging how we read, interpret, and respond to digital information. This emerging trend for the realization of data sets into three-dimensional (3D) physical objects is discussed from the perspective of creative practice and digital information visualization. In these new constructs, digital data sets are concretized into a physical form, remediated from information sources, such as mobile phone coverage records, crime statistics, and temperature patterns. Through a series of examples, the chapter will investigate how these tangible translations can change our relationship to screen-based digital content, in particular statistical data, and seeks to reveal how by encoding digital information into a physical object we can establish a way of reading this data through spatial, temporal, and material variations that sit outside of the computer-monitor and the digital environment.

Primary explanations of these patterns, particularly at the micro-level, have focused on the impact of street culture. In this article, we draw from a multiyear ethnography in Cape Town, South Africa, to offer a theoretical elaboration of the place of culture in contributing to victimization risks among urban minority young men. The study is based on data collected from a sample of 26 young men of color who lived on the Cape Flats between 2003 and 2006. Using grounded theory methods, we suggest the import of unequal access to spatial mobility as a multifaceted means by which culture mediates young men's risks for victimization in disadvantaged communities. We find that transitory mobility-conceptualized as youth's temporary access to cultural spaces outside their segregated residential neighborhoods-is an important source of cultural heterogeneity in townships that can intensify the strength of local social identities and outgroup antipathies directed at those whose mobility is perceived as a cultural threat. Transitorily mobile young men's cultural repertoires are a key facet of street efficacy that can either insulate them from risk or heighten their vulnerabilities. Our findings are suggestive of important sources of variation in young men's victimization outcomes in disadvantaged communities, offering insights about factors that shape risks beyond those linked to the victim-offender overlap in high-risk settings. © 2013 American Society of Criminology.","Cultural heterogeneity; Street culture; Transitory mobility; Victimization risk","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888114670"

Then, we derive the threshold for predicting whether a malware propagates or not in MWSNs as time passes. Finally, we propose the spatial pattern based method to analyze and predict the spatial distribution of nodes infected by malwares as time passes. Both theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results show that the movement speed of nodes and the communication radius of nodes have a significant effect on the malware propagation in MWSNs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","equilibrium point; malware propagation; MWSNs; reaction-diffusion equation; spatial pattern; stability","Convergence of numerical methods; Information management; Linear equations; Mathematical models; Sensor nodes; Equilibrium point; Malware propagation; MWSNs; Reaction diffusion equations; Spatial patterns; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865614588"

With this book, Martin Andresen presents the first comprehensive and sole-authored textbook on this influential and compelling school of criminological thought. He covers a wide range of topics, including: the origins of environmental criminology; the primary theoretical frameworks, such as routine activity theory, geometric theory of crime, rational choice theory, and the pattern theory of crime; the practical application of environmental criminology; an examination of how theories are operationalized and tested; policy implications for the practice of crime prevention. As well as these ""popular topics"", Andresen also discusses also a number of topics that are at the leading edge of research within environmental criminology. This text will be ideal for courses on crime prevention, where students are often encouraged to consider policy problems and apply theory to practice. This book offers up environmental criminology as a theoretical framework for making sense of complex neighbourhood problems, meaning that it will be perfect for modules on geography of crime, crime analysis and indeed, environmental criminology. It would also be a good supplement for courses on criminological theory. © 2014 Martin A. Andresen.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84917195352"

This exploration is placed in the context of West African migration worldwide and based on census material, historical data and empirical data from others and examples from my fieldwork in Senegal and in the Netherlands. The study of West African migrants is specifically of interest in the Netherlands because West African immigration, especially from Ghana and Nigeria, formed an important element in the growth of the authorities' anxiety about illegality and criminality in Dutch society. Dutch antimigrant political climate and strict immigration measurements seem to have two, opposing effects: on the one hand, the period of illegality, and thus of restricted movement, for illegal migrants increases. On the other hand, the stimulus for those with a legal status to migrate out of the Netherlands, and thus their mobility, also increases.","","Ghana; Netherlands; Nigeria; census; empirical analysis; historical perspective; illegal immigrant; migrants experience; mobility; perception; social history","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946174467"

Proximity malware is a class of malware that exploits the opportunistic contacts and distributed nature of DTNs for propagation. Behavioral characterization of malware is an effective alternative to pattern matching in detecting malware, especially when dealing with polymorphic or obfuscated malware. In this paper, we first propose a general behavioral characterization of proximity malware which based on naive Bayesian model, which has been successfully applied in non-DTN settings such as filtering email spams and detecting botnets. We identify two unique challenges for extending Bayesian malware detection to DTNs (""insufficient evidence versus evidence collection risk"" and ""filtering false evidence sequentially and distributedly""), and propose a simple yet effective method, look ahead, to address the challenges. Furthermore, we propose two extensions to look ahead, dogmatic filtering, and adaptive look ahead, to address the challenge of ""malicious nodes sharing false evidence.""

Several studies developed specially during the 90's presented indexes and indicators related to the sustainability of regions. Among them, there can be mentioned the Index for Sustainable Economic Welfare-ISEW, the Human Development Index -HDI, the Genuine Progress Indicator-GPI, the Index of Economic Well-Being and the Human Well-Being Index-HWI. The mentioned indexes represent different indicators, such as: household work, weighted personal consumption, costs of environmental deterioration, longterm environmental damage, depreciation of natural capital, life expectative at birth, level of education, standard of life, cost of resource depletion, pollution, costs of crime, of family breakdown, of automobile accidents, of ozone depletion, loss of farmlands, of wetlands, of forest areas and of leisure time, increase of capital stock and balance of international trade, value of voluntary work, net capital investment, net foreign burrowing, services of highways, mobility, consumption of non-renewable and/or cultural resources, economic inequalities and poverty, communication means, political and civil rights attended and basic needs level of satisfaction and others. Since the indicators have different natures, the process to measure indexes is difficult as they should represent all of them through weights or using analytic methods. One of the Brazilian regions whose sustainable development is questioned is the Baixada Fluminense which comprehends 13 districts, with an area of 2800 km2 and a population close to 4 millions of inhabitants. This region, located in the Rio de Janeiro State, close to Rio de Janeiro City, was irregularly occupied thus affecting the environment and degrading areas where a violent parallel power was establish with the purpose of solving local conflicts (Nascimento, 2011). Nowadays this region was transformed in a dormitory town, providing the City of Rio the Janeiro with man power, especially that of lesser qualification and is poorly provided with policies, practices and tools of governance capable of inducing sustainable regional development (Lago, 2007). Most of the districts that compose the region under study is depicted by press, public opinion and statistic studies as violent and abandoned (Enne, 2004). The present study is a first initiative to measure the stages of the region sustainable development with the definition of indicators and with their relation to the existing legal frame. To achieve this purpose, data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics-IBGE that produced the study ""Profile of Brazilian Municipalities"", was consulted (http:/www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/perfilmunic/2009/default.shtm). After analyzing the mentioned data that comprehend 738 variables that portrays existence and nature of policies, equipment and public management practices, and using an aggregated pattern (Jannuzzi, 2009), the chosen indicators, namely, city planning, municipal management and information and communication technologies, citizenship education, housing and transport, health and welfare, security and justice access, human and gender rights and environment, were meant to represent the sustainability of the development of the chosen Brazilian region, namely, Baixada Fluminense. Once the indicators were defined, the existing legal frame that supports each of them was listed and compounded. The next step consists in verifying the effectiveness of governmental control since the existence of a strong legal frame by itself does not support necessarily the sustainability of the city. It is necessary to apply each one of the mentioned legal prescriptions and to control the construction and the operation of all urban equipments as well as all urban services. After measuring the government behavior in this direction and the existing legal frame actually applied these two aspects are to be compounded to get an answer about the urban region sustainability.","","Accidents; Construction equipment; Costs; Environmental protection; Information technology; International trade; Investments; Ozone layer; Planning; Public policy; Regional planning; Social aspects; Urban planning; Environmental deterioration; Human development index; Information and Communication Technologies; Level of satisfaction; Municipal managements; Security and justices; Sustainable economics; Sustainable regional development; Sustainable development","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899139729"

Despite the number of studies evaluating the collateral consequences of these laws, the implications of spatial restrictions on housing availability and residential mobility for convicted sex offenders remain an empirical question. Because of the social implications, but also risks associated with recidivism, a better understanding of the spatio-temporal movements of sex offenders is critical for developing effective management policies and strategies aimed at promoting public safety. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze sex offender residential movement patterns over a 2.5 year period in Hamilton County, Ohio.

However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example. Methods Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour - central place foraging, Brownian walks and Lévy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Lévy walks, respectively. Results Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Lévy walks. Conclusions The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Lévy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed. © 2014 The Authors.

Azavea recently set out to take advantage of these trends by combining geographic analysis with contemporary machine learning algorithms and cloud computing to help police departments make more effective use of their limited resources. The team developing HunchLab sought not only to implement the yearly warning system represented by the original prototypes, but also to use crime patterns to predict areas at higher than normal risk. The goal was to help officers prevent spikes in crime from even occurring. The team reviewed the academic literature and decided to implement two analytic techniques: near-repeat pattern analysis and cyclic-load forecasting.","","GIS; implementation process; law enforcement; legislation; policy approach","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906231906"

It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC).

We analyze deviations from the given behavior specification for anomalies that indicate a possible misuse of the service related to money laundering activities. We evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach and provide measurements on computational and recognition performance of the tool - Predictive Security Analyser - produced using real operational and simulated logs.

Ltd., a global mobile advertising company based in Singapore. In particular, the task is to identify fraudulent publishers who generate illegitimate clicks, and distinguish them from normal publishers. The competition was held from September 1 to September 30, 2012, attracting 127 teams from more than 15 countries. The mobile advertising data are unique and complex, involving heterogeneous information, noisy patterns with missing values, and highly imbalanced class distribution. The competition results provide a comprehensive study on the usability of data mining-based fraud detection approaches in practical setting. Our principal findings are that features derived from fine-grained timeseries analysis are crucial for accurate fraud detection, and that ensemble methods offer promising solutions to highly-imbalanced nonlinear classification tasks with mixed variable types and noisy/missing patterns.

The variation, on the other hand, raises questions about conceptual and theoretical idioms used so far in the analysis of CMP.

Highlighting the strengths and limitations of the term, I use the rise and fall of CMP in Tel Aviv in 2011 and 2012 as an example of how the implicit logic of aggression and response, so central to earlier employment of the notion of resistance, can be hijacked by defensive regimes that seek to delegitimize and criminalize critique, thus forcing CMP to decline and implode. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.","Contemporary Metropolitan Protest; Criminalization; Ethnography; Protest; Repression; Resistance; Securitization; Tel Aviv; Urban Struggles/Rebel Cities","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905083254"

It reflects on the difficulty this brings for conventional law enforcement activity and illustrates the opportunities provided for situational crime prevention techniques. Conceptually, the chapter draws on the ‘new mobilities paradigm’ (Sheller and Urry 2006) to consider how social changes documented in this emergent social science field intersect with changes in the organisation of criminality – particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality – which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational crime. We examined this phenomenon through a small empirical study conducted in three English police forces between 2007–8. This study comprised an analysis of the organised crime investigations of a medium-sized force, supplemented by 11 interviews conducted with senior investigators in three police forces, attendance at seminars, and informal conversations with practitioners at different organisational levels and locations.; We propose that increased levels of mobile criminality are impacting significantly on the scope and variety of organised crime in England. In particular it is evident that, despite the attention paid to transnational policing in the organised crime literature, the burden of policing organised crime continues to fall upon local police forces where demand outstrips supply. In consequence, the necessity of a new paradigm for dealing with organised crime is critical. We argue here that a situational crime prevention approach, coupled with a further modification of that concept (which we refer to as situational crime disruption), is more effective, in terms of impact and cost. © The editors and contributors 2010.","","","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925854709"

Sensitive and appropriate management of disclosures is essential to re-empower victims in making choices on the course of events following disclosure. Not all victims opt to engage with the criminal justice system. However, the option of police engagement to some degree may be supported by the offering of third-party reporting, providing police with intelligence that would otherwise be inaccessible. The presence of genital injuries is more likely with non-consensual than consensual sexual activity, but genital injuries are still more likely to be absent following sexual assault. Physical examination following sexual assault seeks to identify any peripheral injuries associated with restraint or non-compliance. Screening to exclude the possibility of sexually transmitted infections should be informed by the incubation periods of common pathogens, and prophylactic treatment guided by local resistance patterns. Emergency contraception, ongoing contraception and safer sex advice should form part of the consultation. In addition, self-harm and suicide risk assessments should be undertaken to ensure onward safety.

Machine Learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that then are used to detect attacks on computer systems. The selected attributes were applied to Data Mining Classification Algorithms which helps in bringing out the best and effective Algorithm by making use of the error rates, false positive and packet drop rates. © 2014 IEEE.","Intuitionistic fuzzy; MANET; Relevance Vector Machine","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computer crime; Data mining; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy sets; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Network security; Classification algorithm; Data mining classification algorithms; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Machine learning techniques; MANET; Neural network algorithm; Relevance Vector Machine; Intrusion detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983151051"

I highlight the policy vacuum and challenges of balancing free expression, safety, privacy, supervision and regulation within the school context. I explain the emerging pattern in my research, that suggests digital natives (youth growing up immersed in digital media) often fail to distinguish the lines between harmless joking or teasing, and harmful cyberbullying that negatively impacts those targeted and fail to realize potential legal risks. Legal liability for cyberbullying can include lawsuits for defamation through online postings that spread rumours, gossip and demeaning comments. Young people risk criminal liability for online threats made in jest that might be perceived as ""actual"" threats that will be carried out in physical contexts. Potential charges of possession and distribution of child pornography can be laid for ""sexting,"" a form of intimate photographs or videotapes distributed online to embarrass others. My chapter calls for legal literacy among educators, and the need to sensitize the legal community to shifting norms of social communication among digital youth. I argue that new laws specifically aimed at controlling cyberbullying show less promise than legal frameworks in North America, Europe and Australia that already exist. These frameworks include constitutional and human rights considerations, tort law (civil liability - defamation, libel, slander, privacy); and criminal law. I argue for preventative policy and practice responses that are congruent with the obligations of countries that are parties to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). These approaches will go further towards mobilizing socially responsible digital citizenship among youth than reactive approaches that continue to be adopted by schools and some governments that are introducing harsher legislation. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: prime, rugged, dry, and remote. Prime sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying ""prime"" locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2013.","cannabis; cannabis cultivation; journey to crime; rational choice; target selection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873617093"

In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail-crime pattern and social disorganization theory-and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder. © 2013 American Society of Criminology.","Discrete choice; Random utility model; Riots; Spatial decision making","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877664225"

Across studies, higher social class rank was associated with increased essentialism of social class categories (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and decreased support for restorative justice (Study 4). Moreover, manipulated essentialist beliefs decreased preferences for restorative justice (Study 3), and the association between social class rank and class-based essentialist theories was explained by the tendency to endorse beliefs in a just world (Study 2).

The people of West Africa share a socio-cultural and economic link, which contributes to these movements across national borders. The socio-cultural link is evident through the agglomerations of people by arbitrarily drawing the colonial map. The economic link is facilitated by trading across borders, due to close proximity, and also by socio-cultural and language commonalities. All these factors along, with a shared colonial legacy, influence movement options, whether country of transit or of destination. Human trafficking remains an intractable global problem, 2 which has re-emerged in recent times as a modernized form of slavery. Trafficking involves the movement of people from their country of origin to other destinations by any means of forced labor or services. This illicit business in persons, mostly children and women, affects almost all countries and reaps enormous profits for traffickers and their criminal intermediaries. Human trafficking is considered one of the largest sources of profits for organized crime, generating an estimated seven to ten billion dollars annually, according to the United Nations estimate.3 The globalization of the world economy has increased the movement of people across borders, legally and illegally; especially from the poorer to the wealthier countries. The international organized trafficking network has taken advantage of the free flow of people to extend its own global reach. The trafficking process involves source, transit and destination countries, with some countries combining all these characteristics simultaneously. Since trafficking is an underground criminal enterprise, there are no precise statistics on the extent of the problem. Nevertheless, the estimates of the US Department of State’s 2007 Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP Report) vary from 4 to 27 million. The United Nations estimates that about two million women are trapped each year in the worldwide sex industry, while countless children and other women are forced into low-waged jobs. Below, we focus on labor migration, human trafficking and multinational corporations within the ECOWAS region. This paper examines the patterns and challenges of labor migration in West Africa. To understand the dynamic of labor migration, under the heading of patterns we focus on the causes of labor migration. The challenges to labor migration that are discussed are incoherent policies on migration management. Furthermore, we examine the trafficking of women, girls and children, the root causes of trafficking, ECOWAS involvement in signing and ratifying the ‘human trafficking protocol’ and recommendations to the ECOWAS states for better response to victims of human trafficking. We conclude with recommendations for ECOWAS to formulate and adopt effective policies for migration management in the region. © 2012 Ato Quayson and Antonela Arhin for selection and editorial material.

The internationalization of internal security seems to have sent a new wave through the management and organization oflaw enforcement. First, there is crime itself. European states have come to recognize common patterns in their crime statistics, such as its growth, its scale, and its consequences for society as a whole (Hom & Cozijnsen 1995: 1). Second, the explanation of crime is now more than ever related to supra-nation al causes, such as the relaxation of internal border controls, the cross-frontier mobility of criminals and the global character of crime-enterprises. Law enforcement organizations, mostly the producers of these analyses, react tointernational ization of internal security in different ways. They tend to adapt the scale of their organization to the seriousness of the crime, and they seek to improve their efficiency by adopting innovative managerial strategies. In this process, police organizations monitor the latest developments in befriended and neighbouring countries and 'borrow' features which they consider to be resourceful in their fight against crime problems. This demonstrates how internationalization of criminality influences the development of national law enforcement, but it also demonstrates that, conversely, cross-border law enforcement shopping encourages the internationalization of policing. It goes without doubt that processes of internationalization and cross-fertilization tend to iron out some of the remaining differences between the Anglo-Saxon and continental policing systems. © Rob Mawby 1999.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070971933"

The distributed nature of the architecture reduces the workload on network clients and eliminates duplication of effort wherever possible. The use of virtual machine interfaces between the hardware and the network connection isolates the hardware interface in order to maintain trust and integrity of the connection and reduce the potential for an attacker using a trusted resource to damage network assets.

Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices.

As a result, communication infrastructure gets disrupted for weeks. In such situations, smart-phone based adhoc opportunistic networks may be set up with the smart-phones carried by the relief workers (also referred as nodes) to communicate the situational information from different affected corners to some remote monitoring station. In such scenario, some malicious nodes may try to intercept and manipulate the sensitive situational data with the intention of corruption and fraud. One way of preventing such corruption is to devise an automated mechanism to detect and avoid the malicious nodes during data communication process. Reputation of nodes may be used as a measure to detect malicious nodes where reputation is estimated based on their degree of cooperation with other nodes in the network during data communication. In this paper, we propose an observer based dynamic reputation estimation technique for detection of selfish nodes where a group of independent roving observer nodes were introduced in the network to monitor the behavior of volunteer nodes as forwarder and receiver and to identify whether a node has any group-bias.

Data collected from both police files and semistructured interviews with 72 serial sex offenders who have committed 361 sexual assaults have been used. Negative binomial regression was used to identify the relationships between the situational and modus operandi characteristics and the criminal mobility exhibited during the sexual assault. Events that involved child or adolescent victims, those where the offender did not use pornography prior to crime, and those where victim resistance was observed exhibited more criminal mobility. Moreover, crimes in which the victim was selected, the victim was alone when approached by the offender, and the assault was characterized by sexual penetration and a lack of premeditation exhibited more criminal mobility. Results seem to suggest that criminal mobility is a goal-oriented action taken by serial sex offenders to successfully complete their crime and to avoid detection and apprehension. © The Author(s) 2013.","criminal event; criminal mobility; journey to crime; serial sex offenders; sexual assault","Humans; Models, Psychological; Sex Offenses; Travel; criminal event; criminal mobility; journey to crime; serial sex offenders; sexual assault; article; criminal event; criminal mobility; human; journey to crime; psychological aspect; psychological model; serial sex offenders; sexual assault; sexual crime; statistics; travel","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879200200"

For visualization of the genetic similarity, the dendrogram UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Means) was generated by the similarity matrix of the Jacquard coefficient, based on 34 alleles of ten microsatellite loci. Total DNA was extracted by the CTAB 2x method and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) products were analyzed in denaturing polyacrylamide 6% gels, stained with silver nitrate. The number of base pairs was estimated by the method of inverse mobility, based on known size product regression. Similarity ranged from 34 to 100%, reflecting high genetic variability. Analyzed loci were not enough to distinguish all 17 watermelon cultivars. The pairs 'Sugar Baby' and 'Omaru Yamato', 'Charleston Gray' and 'Sunshade', 'Crimson Sweet' and 'Nova Crimson' presented 100% of similarity. In dendrogram two groups were observed at 0.42 similarity cut point, with Citrullus colocynthis, positioned as an out group. One watermelon group was formed predominantly by cultivars derived from 'Crimson' and another group was formed by cultivars of different types such as 'Sugar Baby', 'Charleston Gray' and 'Pérola'. Allele pattern and base pair (bp) estimates for the 34 alleles in the 10 microsatellite loci revealed in the present study are a first endeavor to use microsatellite markers in situations of cultivar protection for the watermelon agribusiness in Brazil. They can also be used in situations of commercial disputes regarding certification of the main watermelon cultivars used in the country.","Citrullus lanatus; Genetic divergence; Plant variety protection; SSR","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892606424"

Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending. © The Author(s) 2013.","computational criminology; criminological theory; geometry/pattern theories of crime; interpersonal victimization; rational choice theory; routine activity theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891602252"

In this paper, we describe a new, complementary system, called DroidMiner, which uses static analysis to automatically mine malicious program logic from known Android malware, abstracts this logic into a sequence of threat modalities, and then seeks out these threat modality patterns in other unknown (or newly published) Android apps. We formalize a two-level behavioral graph representation used to capture Android app program logic, and design new techniques to identify and label elements of the graph that capture malicious behavioral patterns (or malicious modalities). After the automatic learning of these malicious behavioral models, DroidMiner can scan a new Android app to (i) determine whether it contains malicious modalities, (ii) diagnose the malware family to which it is most closely associated, (iii) and provide further evidence as to why the app is considered to be malicious by including a concise description of identified malicious behaviors. We evaluate DroidMiner using 2,466 malicious apps, identified from a corpus of over 67,000 third-party market Android apps, plus an additional set of over 10,000 official market Android apps. Using this set of real-world apps, we demonstrate that DroidMiner achieves a 95.3% detection rate, with only a 0.4% false positive rate. We further evaluate DroidMiner's ability to classify malicious apps under their proper family labels, and measure its label accuracy at 92%. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","android Malware Analysis and Detection; mobile Security","Commerce; Computer crime; Malware; Security of data; Security systems; Static analysis; Android applications; Android malware; Automatic-learning; Behavioral patterns; Complementary systems; False positive rates; Graph representation; Mobile security; Android (operating system)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906493196"

We do not wish to offend anyone by what we say. But consideration of our speech is not something new. As Gabriella Baika stakes out in this thought-provoking manuscript, worries about transgressive speech began in the High Middle Ages. This broad-ranging book, which explores the notion of peccata linguae ""sins of the tongue,"" mobilized the work efforts of an impressive number of theologians. Moral errors committed with the aid of the tongue, the organ responsible for speech, came to be viewed as crimes comparable to theft, adultery, or murder. The Rose and Geryon examines patterns of verbal behavior in works by Jean de Meun and Dante (with a focus on the Romance of the Rose and the Divine Comedy) in relationship with the most influential systems of verbal sins in the Middle Ages, systems elaborated by William Peraldus, Thomas Aquinas, Domenico Cavalca, and Laurent of Orléans. The book begins with a presentation of these four systems, and from there proceeds to analyze Jean de Meun's Testament as a possible source of influence for the Divine Comedy and take a closer look at Dante's prose works in search for a comprehensive theory of sinful speech. Furthermore Baika discusses verbal transgressions such as flattery, evil counsel, double talk, sowing of discord, and falsifying of words, under the heading Lingua dolosa ""The Guileful Tongue,"" and the relationship between violence and the poetic discourse. The myriad ways in which the two iconic poets of medieval France and Italy absorb the tradition of peccata linguae in their works prove that abusive speech was not the exclusive sphere of interest of the ecclesiastical writers; secular poetry in the vernacular enriched in original ways the medieval debate on verbal vices. The Rose and Geryon addresses scholars and students of French and Italian literatures, as well as readers interested in ethics and women's studies. © 2014 The Catholic University of America Press.

Exposure of these people to arsenic was assessed using synchrotron-based elemental X-ray fluorescence mapping, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectromicroscopy measurements on ancient human hair. These combined techniques of high sensitivity and specificity enabled the discrimination between endogenous and exogenous processes that has been an analytical challenge for archeological studies and criminal investigations in which hair is used as a proxy of premortem metabolism. The high concentration of arsenic mainly in the form of inorganic As(III) and As(V) detected in the hair suggests chronic arsenicism through ingestion of As-polluted water rather than external contamination by the deposition of heavy metals due to metallophilic soil microbes or diffusion of arsenic from the soil. A decrease in arsenic concentration from the proximal to the distal end of the hair shaft analyzed may indicate a change in the diet due to mobility, though chemical or microbiologically induced processes during burial cannot be entirely ruled out. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","","Arsenic; Arsenic Poisoning; Chile; Hair; History, Medieval; Humans; Synchrotrons; Arsenic; Chemical analysis; Chemical contamination; Chemical speciation; Heavy metals; Water pollution; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; arsenic; Analytical challenge; Arsenic concentration; Combined techniques; Criminal investigation; External contamination; Fourier transform infra reds; Intermediate periods; X ray fluorescence; arsenic poisoning; article; chemistry; Chile; hair; history; human; metabolism; synchrotron; utilization review; Soil pollution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891817454"

Since 2007, budgeted expenditures incurred by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) aimed at protecting the public have been categorised into objectives which are disclosed on the web. This study examined the annual expenditures patterns of those budgeted categories and found that the monetary amount and priority rankings of the respective categories were quite predictable. In other words the two goals and their related objectives appear to have received consistent priority and levels of funding. Within the nine categories, the cost per Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) can be quite different. Overall, it can also be said that based on the amounts approved by Congress during the period studied, the FTC is funded well because the changes are significant.

Servers of many companies and/or governments have been victims of such attacks. DDoS attacks jam the network service of the target using multiple bots hijacked by crackers and send numerous packets to the target server. In such an attack, detecting the crackers is extremely difficult, because they only send a command by multiple bots from another network and then leave the bots quickly after command execute. Therefore, we need an intelligent detection system for DDoS attacks to defend network services. To develop the system, we utilized machine learning techniques to study the patterns of DDoS attacks and detect them. We analyzed large numbers of network packets provided by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis, and detected some important patterns that affect the accuracy of the detection system. We implemented the detection system using the patterns of DDoS attacks. A support vector machine with the radial basis function (Gaussian) kernel is its core part. The detection system is accurate in detecting DDoS attacks. © 2014 Infonomics Society.","bigdata analysis; distributed denial of service attack; machine teaming; netowrk security","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided network analysis; Computer crime; Cracks; Internet; Learning systems; Mobile security; Network security; Radial basis function networks; Transmission control protocol; bigdata analysis; Distributed denial of service attack; Intelligent detection; Large-scale network; Machine learning techniques; netowrk security; Network services; Radial basis functions; Denial-of-service attack","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949922880"

Theoretically bundled within these neighborhood effects are institutions' and actors' social networks that are the foundation of other neighborhood-level processes such as social control, mobilization, and cultural assimilation. Yet, despite such long-standing theoretical links between neighborhoods and social networks, empirical research rarely considers or measures dimensions of geography and social network mechanisms simultaneously. The present study seeks to fill this gap by analyzing how both geography and social networks influence an important social problem in urban America: gang violence. Using detailed data on fatal and non-fatal shootings, we examine effects of geographic proximity, organizational memory, and additional group processes (e.g., reciprocity, transitivity, and status seeking) on gang violence in Chicago and Boston. Results show adjacency of gang turf and prior conflict between gangs are strong predictors of subsequent gang violence. Furthermore, important network processes, including reciprocity and status seeking, also contribute to observed patterns of gang violence. In fact, we find that these spatial and network processes mediate racial effects, suggesting the primacy of place and the group in generating gang violence. © American Sociological Association 2013.","intergroup conflict; neighborhoods; social networks; spatial analysis; street gangs; violent crime","Boston; Chicago; Illinois; Massachusetts; United States; acculturation; crime; neighborhood; social network; spatial analysis; theoretical study; urban area; urban society; violence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878489119"

The proposed framework relies on client-server architecture, the client continuously extracts various features and transfers them to the server, and the server's main task is to detect anomalies using state-of-art detection algorithms. Multiple distributed servers simultaneously analyze the feature vector using various detectors and information fusion is used to concatenate the results of detectors. We also propose a cycle-based statistical approach for mobile device anomaly detection. We accomplish this by analyzing the users' regular usage patterns. Empirical results suggest that the proposed framework and novel anomaly detection algorithm are highly effective in detecting malware on Android devices. © 2013 IEEE.","Malware; Security; Service-oriented; Smartphones","Client server computer systems; Computation theory; Computer crime; Information services; Mobile devices; Network security; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Signal detection; Smartphones; Ubiquitous computing; Anomaly detection; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Client-server architectures; Detection algorithm; Distributed servers; Security; Service Oriented; Statistical approach; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903998624"

Academia has taught computer forensics students that one of the most important elements of the digital forensic process is having a working copy of the original device. Though this concept works well with computers and laptops, it does not with smartphones. At this point, a bit-for-bit image of a smartphone cannot be made. Furthermore, any action taken on a smartphone is logged and therefore, attempting to create a copy would in essence change the state of the device; making the use of hashes null and void. In an effort to realize interesting and unique forensic patterns in the operations of smartphones, two experiments were designed using XRY, DiffMerge, and four smartphone devices: RIM Blackberry 8703e, Blackberry 7103, Blackberry 8530, and Symbian HTC TouchPro 6850. These experiments allowed the researchers to compare and contrast the four smartphones not only by the specific device but by carrier, manufacturer, file size by category, file size by test, and folder size in terms of how the kernel deals with file stores, edits, and deletes after specific user operations. The outcome of the experiments resulted in a process that helps the forensic examiner to manually inspect a device while being aware of the path of contamination introduced to the device through user functions. The goal of this research is to create an open debate in the forensic community about the consideration of different standards when examining smartphones, one of which would be the acceptance of change. © 2013 IEEE.","digital forensics; mobile device; process modelling; Small Scale Digital Forensics","Computer forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Experiments; Mobile devices; National security; Security systems; Signal encoding; Digital forensic; File sizes; Process modelling; Symbian; Smartphones","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893300247"

We examined this phenomenon through a small empirical study conducted in three English police forces between 2007-8.

According to their creation purpose, they can execute their tasks autonomously in distributed environments by communicating with other mobile and static agents. In this paper, we described an architecture for intrusion detection by combining both lDS mechanisms of both network and host based lDS. The proposed approach can monitor the system by using mobile agents which are the lowest-level element to collect and analyze intrusion data. By using this technology it is aimed to overcome the speed-bottleneck of lDS by reducing network load.","Cyber-attack; Intrusion detection; Mobile agent; Security","Autonomous agents; Computer crime; Mobile agents; Network architecture; Cyber-attacks; Distributed environments; Distributed intrusion detection systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Mobile agent-based systems; Network activities; Network based intrusion detection systems; Security; Intrusion detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907402815"

Such reforms often have coincided with the retrenchment of state-sponsored social insurance, even as unemployment, crime, and informality have risen. This article examines how insecurity associated with lack of adequate protection against the risks of income loss and violent crime affects patterns of political engagement in Brazil. Although it is often assumed that insecurity is mobilizing, analysis of an original household survey reveals that those lacking the means to ensure against livelihood risks are systematically more likely to forbear from active political participation. Insecurity and poverty, moreover, reveal divergent effects on political participation, wherein it is not the poorest, but rather the most insecure citizens who are most likely to forbear from active citizenship. Emerging democracies thus may be more deeply riven by cleavages of insecurity than by income when it comes to the question of whose voice is heard in democratic politics. © Southern Political Science Association, 2014.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84910639681"

Success of P2P networks has encouraged mobile vendors to offer P2P services on mobile networks. Handheld mobile devices though constrained in memory, power and processing resources are capable of using communication technologies like Bluetooth, MMS, SMS, Infrared and WLAN services. Such versatility has however exposed mobile devices to threats like mobile P2P malware. With the number of mobile phone malware escalating to an alarming figure of more than one thousand, it has become ever more important to analyze the affects of propagation of such malware in the wild that could subsequently act as the baseline for protection against such malware. This paper initially presents propagation analysis of generic mobile P2P malware categories and then provides a detailed analysis of propagation of real-world malware from three malware families accommodating around 100 well known mobile P2P malware. Paper is aimed at providing a much needed insight into propagation characteristics of mobile P2P malware like their propagation speed and battery depletion affect. © 2014 IEEE.","Malware classification; Malware propagation; Mobile malware families; Mobile P2P","Computer crime; Information technology; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Peer to peer networks; Communication technologies; Handheld mobile devices; Malware classifications; Malware propagation; Mobile malware; Mobile P2P; Propagation analysis; Propagation characteristics; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903466350"

Various information is potential to be mined from it. In this paper, the large-scale mobile internet traffic is employed to protect end-users from mobile malwares that emerge at a similar speed to that of mobile internet. Traditional mobile malware detection methods often inevitably consume the limited battery life and computing resource of the end device. To solve these problems, a novel framework, Mining Mobile Internet Packets for Malware Detection (MMIP-MD), is proposed. Since the new technology of format preserving encryption (FPE) made the data of mobile internet traffic from telecommunication operators accessible and minable without leaking end-users' privacies, the framework thus aims feasibly at detecting mobile malwares using the traffic data only, which moves the detection from the end device to the internet side. It has good extensibility since a variety of mining algorithms can be applied on this framework to discover behavioral patterns of malwares. In addition, a real example of Bayes classification was implemented to illustrate the framework and test its feasibility. © 2014 IEEE.","big data; data mining; MMIP-MD; mobile internet; packet","Algorithms; Big data; Computer crime; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Mobile devices; Bayes classification; Behavioral patterns; Computing resource; Format-preserving encryptions; Mining algorithms; Mobile Internet; packet; Telecommunication operators; Malware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946686964"

Estimates indicate that billions of text messages are traveling the airwaves daily. Nevertheless, text messaging is becoming a source of customer dissatisfaction due to the rapid surge of messaging abuse activities. Although spam is a well tackled problem in the email world, SMS spam experiences a yearly growth larger than 500%. In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis of SMS spam traffic from a tier-1 cellular operator. Communication patterns of spammers are compared to those of legitimate cell-phone users and Machine to Machine (M2M) connected appliances. The results indicate that M2M systems exhibit communication profiles similar to spammers, which could mislead spam filters. Beyond the expected results, such as a large load of text messages sent out to a wide target list, other interesting findings are made. For example, the results indicate that the great majority of the spammers connect to the network with just a handful of different hardware models. We find the main geographical sources of messaging abuse in the US. We also find evidence of spammer mobility, voice and data traffic resembling the behavior of legitimate customers. © 2012 ACM.","abuse; cellular networks; SMS; spam; traffic analysis","Internet; Telephone systems; abuse; Cellular network; SMS; spam; Traffic analysis; Message passing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870944163"

With these types of security methods being used, there is much vulnerability. Another alternative is biometric authentication. Biometric security systems have been researched for many years. Some mobile manufacturers have implemented fingerprint scanners into their phones, such as the old Fujitsu F505i [7] and the current Motorola Atrix. Since theft of cell phones is becoming more common every day, there is a real need for a security system that not only protects the data, but the phone itself. It is proposed through this research that a biometric security system be the alternative to knowledge-based and password-based authentication. Furthermore, a device dongle must be implemented into this infrastructure to establish a reliable security system that deters theft for the majority; biometrics alone is not sufficient. Cell phones need power and must be charged almost daily. A biometric phone charger that acts as a dongle with a solid state relay, will be presented as a viable solution to theft in this research. Additionally, it will be shown through the results of this research that a system dependant only on biometrics is unreliable and unsecure. Essentially, a mobile security system that combines biometrics with dongle technology is believed to be the ideal solution for limiting the black market of stolen cell phones; without the biometric charger/dongle, the stolen cell phone would be rendered useless. © 2013 IEEE.","biometric security; cell phone biometrics; cell phone relay; cell phone security dongle; mobile devices; mobile security","Authentication; Cellular telephones; Crime; Knowledge based systems; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Research; Security systems; Telephone sets; Biometric authentication; Biometric security; Biometric security systems; Cell phone; Fingerprint scanners; Mobile security; Password-based authentication; Viable solutions; Biometrics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84882766265"

For purposes of this research, we have classified events as «unusual» for a mobile user when an event is an infrequently occurring one from the user's normal behavior patterns-all of which are collected and recorded on a user's mobile phone. We build a general unusual event classification model to be automated on the smartphone for use by any mobile phone users. To classify both normal and unusual events, we analyzed the activity, location, and audio sensor data collected from 20 mobile phone users to identify these users' personalized normal daily behavior patterns and any unusual events occurring in their daily activity. We used binary fusion classification algorithms on the subjects' recorded experimental data and ultimately identified the most accurately performing fusion algorithm for unusual event detection. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors.

Results indicate a 46 percent reduction in offenders violating spatial restriction zone policy as compared to a counterfactual case where offenders move as a function of housing distributions. Strong legacy effects are also found as offenders previously in violation of restriction policies move into other restricted zones at a higher rate than offenders who were previously in compliance with the policy. Parcels that previously were home to registered offenders also continue to attract offenders in future periods. Although we find differences in the probabilities of attracting offenders for parcels outside and inside restricted zones that are consistent with offender restrictive policies, these differences are actually significantly smaller than what holds under the counterfactual. Parcels in restricted zones continue to attract offenders at a higher rate than expected, despite the policy restrictions. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Markov chains; sex offenders; space-time","Hamilton County [Ohio]; Ohio; United States; compliance; Markov chain; movement; policy making; probability; residential mobility; spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891558005"

Automated traffic applications typically encompass the detection and segmentation of moving vehicles as a crucial process. Background subtraction and shadow detection are amongst the most challenging tasks involved in the segmentation of foreground blobs in dynamic environments. An effective balance between accuracy and speed is required to process a continuous feed of high resolution images from multiple cameras. Police Eyes is a mobile, real-time traffic surveillance system we have developed to enable automatic detection of traffic violations. Police Eyes would be useful to police for enforcing traffic laws and would also increase compliance with traffic laws even in the absence of police. The system detects illegal crossings of solid lines using image processing and efficient computer vision techniques on image sequences acquired from IP cameras. The automatic solid line crossing detection system can be used at locations where the traffic violations are notoriously high and are known to create traffic congestion and avoidable accidents. The system can be installed on an embankment, at an intersection area, at a lane change restriction area, at a no parking area or anywhere there is an observed pattern of drivers intentionally violating traffic laws. We have installed the system in an industrial grade embedded PC and deployed it in a police mannequin. Results of an empirical field evaluation show that the system performs well in a variety of real-world traffic scenes. © 2013 IEEE.","","Crime; Image processing; Motor transportation; Telecommunication traffic; Traffic congestion; Automated detection; Automatic Detection; Background subtraction; Computer vision techniques; Dynamic environments; High resolution image; Intersection areas; Real-time traffic surveillances; Information technology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883072382"

The main goal of the proposed system is to protect mobile device users and cellular infrastructure companies from malicious applications by: (1) identification of malicious attacks or masquerading applications installed on a mobile device, and (2) identification of republished popular applications injected with a malicious code (i.e., repackaging). More specifically, we attempt to detect a new type of mobile malware with self-updating capabilities that were recently found on the official Google Android marketplace. Malware of this type cannot be detected using the standard signatures approach or by applying regular static or dynamic analysis methods. The detection is performed based on the application's network traffic patterns only. For each application, a model representing its specific traffic pattern is learned locally (i.e., on the device). Semi-supervised machine-learning methods are used for learning the normal behavioral patterns and for detecting deviations from the application's expected behavior. These methods were implemented and evaluated on Android devices. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that: (1) various applications have specific network traffic patterns and certain application categories can be distinguished by their network patterns; (2) different levels of deviation from normal behavior can be detected accurately; (3) in the case of self-updating malware, original (benign) and infected versions of an application have different and distinguishable network traffic patterns that in most cases, can be detected within a few minutes after the malware is executed while presenting very low false alarms rate; and (4) local learning is feasible and has a low performance overhead on mobile devices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago.

However, such studies have been largely atheoretical and may have confounded warning and coaching. This study examined the effect on malingering of a warning that was based on criminological-sociological concepts derived from the rational choice model of deterrence theory. A total of 78 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unwarned simulator group, or one of two warned simulator groups. The warning groups comprised low- and high-level conditions depending on warning intensity. Simulator participants received no coaching about how to fake tests. Outcome variables were scores derived from the Test of Memory Malingering and Wechsler Memory Scale-III. When the rate of malingering was compared across the four groups, a high-level warning effect was found such that warned participants were significantly less likely to exaggerate than unwarned simulators. In an exploratory follow-up analysis, the warned groups were divided into those who reported malingering and those who did not report malingering, and the performance of these groups was compared to that of unwarned simulators and controls. Using this approach, results showed that participants who were deterred from malingering by warning performed no worse than controls. However, on a small number of tests, self-reported malingerers in the low-level warning group appeared less impaired than unwarned simulators. This pattern was not observed in the high-level warning condition. Although cautious interpretation of findings is necessitated by the exploratory nature of some analyses, overall results suggest that using a carefully designed warning may be useful for reducing the rate of malingering. The combination of some noteworthy effect sizes, despite low power and the small size of some groups, suggests that further investigation of the effects of warnings needs to continue to determine their effect more fully. © 2010 Psychology Press.","Deterrence theory; Malingering; Neuropsychology; Simulation; Test of Memory Malingering; Warnings; Wechsler Memory Scale-III","Adolescent; Adult; Cues; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Deception; Female; Humans; Lie Detection; Male; Malingering; Memory Disorders; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Wechsler Scales; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; association; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; forensic medicine; human; male; malingering; memory disorder; middle aged; neuropsychological test; physiology; psychological aspect; psychomotor performance; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; recumbency; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; Wechsler Intelligence Scale; deception; malingering; Memory Disorders; psychology; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955068782"

A systematic study of South Africa’s current history reveals that the government’s repressive policies during apartheid and the political rivalry among different political parties notably ANC and IFP during transition, had provided a fertile ground for the emergence of the culture of violence. In fact, this culture of violence continues to persist in post-apartheid South Africa even after almost two decades of rule of the democratic government. Moreover, high levels of corruption and links between criminal gangs and government officials in the post-apartheid period has worsened the condition in South Africa.

However, in much of the previous work, the focus was either on spatial or temporal analysis related to the evolution of local crime patterns in conjunction with the special events. This research uses a hybrid agent-based simulation to examine the impact of temporal pulse events on the criminal site selection process. The simulation provides researchers with a method for adjusting both the temporal and spatial patterns in response to a series of a-priori special events. Using the data from this simulation, we illustrate the effectiveness of a new modeling approach. Initial results show that adding a hierarchical framework to a feature-space regression model improves crime prediction accuracy and offers the law enforcement analyst better insight into both the temporal and spatial considerations of criminals.

We present a novel probabilistic diffusion scheme for detecting anomalies possibly indicating malware which is based on device usage patterns. The relationship between samples of normal behavior and their features are modeled through a bipartite graph which constitutes the basis for the stochastic diffusion process. Subsequently, we establish an indirect similarity measure among sample points.

One common pattern of many commonly found malware on mobile phones is that: the malware always attempts to access sensitive system services on the mobile phone in an unobtrusive and stealthy fashion. For example, the malware may send messages automatically or stealthily interface with the audio peripherals on the device without the user's awareness and authorization. To detect the unauthorized malicious behavior, we present SBIDF, a Specification Based Intrusion Detection Framework, which utilizes the keypad or touchscreen interrupts to differentiate between malware and human activity. Specifically, in the proposed framework, we use an application independent specification, written in Temporal Logic of Causal Knowledge (TLCK), to describe the normal behavior pattern, and enforce this specification to all third party applications on the mobile phone during runtime by monitoring the inter-component communication pattern among critical components. Our evaluation of simulated behavior of real world malware shows that we are able to detect all forms of malware that attempts to access sensitive services without possessing user's permission. Furthermore, the SBIDF incurs a negligible overhead (20 μ secs) which makes it very feasible for real world deployment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Audio Attack; Intrusion Detection; Messaging Attack; Mobile Phone","Computer crime; Cryptography; Intrusion detection; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Specifications; Telephone; Telephone sets; Temporal logic; Audio Attack; Communication pattern; Critical component; Human activities; Malicious behavior; Malwares; Messaging Attack; Mobile markets; Normal behavior; Real world deployment; Runtimes; Sensitive systems; Simulated behaviors; Third parties; Touch screen; Cellular telephone systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959294299"

Recently, a number of experiments have explored the problem of spatial or temporal data mining, and some clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, not many studies have been dealing with the integration of spatial data mining and temporal data mining. Moreover, the data in spatial temporal database can be categorized as high-dimensional data. Current density-based clustering might have difficulties with complex data sets including high-dimensional data. This paper presents Iterative Local Gaussian Clustering (ILGC), an algorithm that combines K-nearest neighbour (KNN) density estimation and Kernel density estimation, to cluster the spatiotemporal data. In this approach, the KNN density estimation is extended and combined with Kernel function, where KNN contributes in determining the best local data iteratively for kernel density estimation. The local best is defined as the set of neighbour data that maximizes the kernel function. Bayesian rule is used to deal with the problem of selecting the best local data. This paper utilized Gaussian kernel which has been proven successful in the clustering. To validate the KNN-kernel based algorithm, we compare its performance againts other popular algorithms, such as Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and K-Means, on Crime database. Results show that KNN-kernel based clustering has outperformed others. © 2010 IEEE.","Bayesian rule; Gaussian Kernel; Iterative Local Gaussian Clustering; Kernel clustering; KNN; Spatio-temporal database","Bayesian networks; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Database systems; Estimation; Gaussian distribution; Mobile telecommunication systems; Probability density function; Self organizing maps; Bayesian rule; Gaussian kernels; Gaussians; Kernel clustering; KNN; Spatio-temporal database; Clustering algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957758160"

Conceptually, the paper draws on the “new mobilities paradigm”. Empirically, it is based on a small, exploratory study, comprising analysis of investigations carried out over a three-month period in 2007 and 2008, by a serious and organised crime unit in a police force in England, and 11 interviews carried out in three police forces in England. The data are used for illustrative purposes only. It is argued that increased levels of mobile criminality are impacting significantly on British police forces, placing considerable strain on the practical structures which underpin the NIM, and posing serious challenges to operational efficiency and effectiveness. This paper makes a contribution by linking the social changes documented in the emergent social science field of “mobilities study” with changes in the organisation of criminality, particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality, which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational as well as “lower level” crime. Examining this phenomenon enables us to see that despite the attention paid to transnational policing in the organised crime literature, the burden of policing both organised and opportunistic crime continues to fall upon local police forces. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Crimes; Globalization; Information management; Policing; United Kingdom","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957896744"

Current intrusion detection technologies have several shortcomings. Applying mobile agents to intrusion detection design is step forward on better intrusion detection. Mobile-agent based distributed intrusion detection systems are very promising for the following reasons: reduction of data movement, load-balance, flexibility, fault-tolerance, detection of distributed attacks. Hybrid intrusion detection is defined by both the method used to detect attacks and the placement of the system on the network. Intrusion detection system may perform either misuse detection or anomaly detection and may be deployed as network-based or host-based system. This paper proposes to distribute classical intrusion detection model with mobile agents making an agent-based hybrid intrusion detection system. The proposed model can help detect simple intrusions in early stage and also distributed intrusions by monitoring several subjects installed on network. Main benefit from mobile agents in such system is ability to generate separate services for specific tasks and analyze unknown user patterns with several methods of artificial intelligence.","Hybrid intrusion detection; Intrusion detection systems; Mobile agents; Network security","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Mobile agents; Network security; Patient monitoring; Regional planning; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Fault tolerance; Mercury (metal); Mobile agents; Network security; Patient monitoring; Regional planning; Agent-based hybrids; Computer and networks; Distributed attack; Distributed intrusion detection systems; Hybrid intrusion detection; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion detection technologies; Agent-based hybrids; Computer and networks; Distributed attack; Distributed intrusion detection systems; Hybrid intrusion detection; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion detection technologies; Intrusion detection; Intrusion detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893360608"

And how severe are the negative effects of counterterrorism on civil liberties, the rule of law, and patterns of democratic governance? We focus here on advanced liberal democracies other than the United States in order to provide historical and comparative perspective.1 The effects of the American global war on terrorism have been studied extensively, but the discussion is not always situated in a broader international context.2 This volume does not deal specifically with the United States, but several of the chapters consider the American case within a comparative framework. Many of the discussions are also concerned with the divisions between the United States and Europe in dealing with contemporary terrorism. Also, since the shock of the 9/11 attacks, legal scholars have addressed the effects of counterterrorism much more energetically and thoroughly than have political scientists. This volume is the beginning of an effort to fill the gap in our understanding of the political as well as the legal impact of democratic responses to terrorism.3 Counterterrorism policy is controversial, and it is almost certain to become more so if governments continue to strengthen their response to terrorism. Democratic governments do not initiate counterterrorism policy with the express intent of undermining democracy, but they may be too ready to accept the idea of an inevitable trade-off between security and liberty; to think that because terrorists might exploit democracy, attractive ""loopholes"" must be closed; or to deny the real costs of counterterrorism. Fears of failing to prevent a disastrous terrorist attack causing a large loss of civilian lives may lead policymakers to take a shortsighted and overconfident view of the ability of robust security measures to prevent terrorism. The contributors to this volume agree that the effects of the response to terrorism have been costly to democracy in many ways, but that within certain broad outlines, policy consequences have differed in nature and severity. In general, policy changes since 2001 have been much more damaging to democracy than earlier counterterrorism measures, even as responses to the threat of Al Qaeda and its associated groups have usually not departed radically from counterterrorism policies of the past. A key consideration in analyzing these issues is the possibility that a government's response to terrorism will diminish democracy more than the acts of terrorism themselves. Liberal democracies confront painful policy choices: Terrorism is a threat that must be confronted in order to preserve the safety and security of the nation, but counterterrorist policies can diminish individual civil liberties and alter patterns of governance to the detriment of democracy. Measures designed to prevent terrorism often limit the basic rights and freedoms of citizens, invade their privacy, strengthen executive power, centralize police and intelligence bureaucracies, blur the distinction between domestic intelligence and law enforcement functions, expand the influence of the military in decisionmaking, cloak decisionmaking processes in secrecy, and encourage undemocratic shifts in public attitudes and political values (such as intolerance toward minorities or unquestioning acceptance of erosions of civil liberties).4 In fact, as John E. Finn's chapter notes, it is not a simple matter even to determine what national counterterrorism policies are. Their scope goes well beyond specifically labeled antiterrorism legislation, and counterterrorism regimes are constantly changing. Internationally, common strategies against terrorism can lead to closed borders and reliance on military force over criminal justice, as well as infringements of individual rights. Disagreements over how to deal with terrorism spark controversy and partisanship within and between nations. The Bush administration's pursuit of a global war on terror frustrated many allies-and where governments were supportive of the United States, their publics often were not. Risk perceptions and conceptions of ""homeland security"" diverge (Föhrenbach 2006). Many of the political consequences of counterterrorism efforts are unintended or secondary, although some cynical observers might suspect that governments, particularly officials of the executive branch, manipulate the threat of terrorism to expand their powers. The effects discussed here, however, seem frequently to have been unanticipated. In the heat of the moment of crisis, governments tend to act in haste without fully considering either the full scope of the alternative actions that are open to them or the consequences of that range of options. Lack of forethought and preparation produces decisions that are less than optimally rational, and publics have little chance to weigh in even if they have the inclination, expertise, and information to do so. There is insufficient check on what the government does. The question then is how enduring such changes are and whether they can be reversed if their effects are later judged harmful to democracy. This is a key element of the concept of proportionality of response to threat. Experiences and perceptions of the threat of terrorism vary considerably among countries, not just between the United States and the rest of the world, and responses differ according to the threat and according to context. Before the 9/11 attacks, the consensus was that democracies confronting internal threats or ""domestic terrorism"" were more likely to adopt policies that undermine democratic principles than were democracies facing terrorism originating from outside, or ""international terrorism"" (Charters 1994, 213-14). That is, states presumably react more harshly to civil violence from groups composed of their own citizens acting within their borders than to violence organized by foreigners or occurring outside the country. The implications of violent dissent from within seemed much more serious than the external threat of terrorist attack, which before 9/11 was considered minor and was in fact extremely rare. In general, terrorism was not a national security issue, although the Reagan administration took international terrorism quite seriously, blamed Soviet ""state sponsorship"" of terrorism as part of the Cold War rivalry, and bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan complicity in terrorism directed against American targets in West Germany. Since the American declaration of a war on terror, however, the argument that internal terrorism is most provocative can certainly no longer be sustained. It is also interesting to note that the European Union (EU) list of terrorist organizations makes a distinction between domestic groups and those with foreign affiliations or transnational ambitions, and that the two types are subject to different levels of sanctions (see chapter 3). Complicating matters, as we have come to recognize in the period since the 9/11 attacks, is the fact that many terrorist conspiracies are mixed in origin rather than exclusively internal or external, a point that Dirk Haubrich stresses in his chapter on the United Kingdom. Terrorist plots often involve a combination of citizens of the state and noncitizens or local operatives with external direction, resources, or inspiration.5 Many such plots are rooted in social and family networks that are transnational. These groups are not directed by states, although their leaders may seek refuge in lawless areas, ally themselves with weak regimes such as the Taliban, or seek support from diasporas located abroad. National borders are increasingly blurred and permeable, especially as electronic communications make it easier to organize underground conspiracies across continents and to publicize a group's ambitions worldwide to mobilize support and inspire imitation. Because some terror plots now emanate from sources formerly considered benign or inconsequential, expressions of religious faith or identity can seem alarming. Germany and Japan, for example, have removed protected religious status from some opposition groups charged with using or advocating terrorism. Britain also cracked down on mosques led by radical Islamist clerics who preached support for anti-Western terrorism, such as Abu Qatada, although Britain was relatively slow to act even after the 9/11 attacks. It has become harder to obtain such privileged status, but the long-term effects are still uncertain. One possibility is that radical activity will shift from mosques or on other public religious establishments to underground venues or onto the Internet. © 2010 by Russell Sage Foundation.

Geographic mobility was defined as the use of multiple locations to obtain repetitive sexual contact with the same victim. The sample consisted of 77 adult offenders convicted for having committed a sexual offence against a child, and who agreed to provide confidential self-report data concerning their offending behaviours. Based on a set of offence characteristics, offenders who used a single location were compared to offenders who used multiple locations for sexual contact. Results showed that offenders who used multiple locations are more likely to isolate the victim, use violence, involve the victim in several sexual episodes, abuse the victim for a period exceeding one year, and make the victim participate and perform sexual behaviours on them during sexual episodes. Examining more closely offenders who used multiple locations for abuse, three offence patterns were further identified (i.e., familial-low mobility offence, non familial-high mobility offence, and familial-high mobility offence). Going for a car ride was also found to be a common location/situation used in the familial-low mobility offence subgroup, while the use of outdoor locations on a regular basis was found to be rare in high mobility patterns subgroups. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954758197"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN. © 2012 IEEE.","Black hole attack; Denial of Service; Intrusion Detection Systems; MANET; Routing attacks; Simulation-based security analysis; Wireless Sensor Networks","Communication; Intrusion detection; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile devices; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Transmission control protocol; Wireless sensor networks; Black hole attack; Denial of Service; Intrusion Detection Systems; MANET; Routing attacks; Simulation-based security; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863893394"

However, the lack of security mechanisms makes them vulnerable to attacks such as file piece pollution, connection slot consumption, and bandwidth exhaustion. These effects are made worse by the ability of attackers to manufacture new identities, or Sybil nodes, at will. The net effect of Sybil nodes and weak security leads to inefficient BitTorrent operation, or collapse. In this paper, we present defenses against threats from Sybil attackers in BitTorrent.

In this study, we investigated the child, family, and school-related antecedents of the onset and prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 for a cohort of 1208 low-income minority children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Data on well-being have been collected prospectively since birth from administrative records, parents, teachers, and children. Results indicated that the prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 was 26% (self-reports or criminal justice system records) with a median age of first use of 17. Probit regression analysis indicated that substance abuse prevalence was primarily determined by gender (males had a higher rate), trouble-making behavior by age 12, school mobility, and previous substance use. Family and peer predictors included involvement in the child welfare system by age 9, parent expectations for school success at age 9, parent substance abuse by child's age 15, and deviant peer affiliation by age 16. Age of first substance use was predicted by gender and race/ethnicity (males and Blacks had earlier incidence), involvement in the child welfare system, and family risk status at age 8. As with prevalence, the pattern of predictors for males was similar to the overall sample but the magnitude of effects was stronger. The predictors of the timing of substance use dependency were gender, family conflict by age 5, involvement in the child welfare system, social maturity at age 9, adolescent school mobility, and school dropout by age 16. Findings indicate that the promotion of family involvement and positive school and social behaviors can reduce the risk of substance abuse. © 2010.","Child development; Drug use; Longitudinal design; Prediction; Substance abuse","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954145286"

Today about 70 million people are of foreign birth or parentage-23 percent of all Americans, including 90 percent of all Asians and 76 percent of all Hispanics (Portes and Rumbaut 2006). They include nearly 70 million foreign-born persons-of whom 12 million are estimated to be undocumented immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Central America (Passell 2006)-and another 40 million of foreign parentage. This immigrant-stock population, the largest ever, is a youthful one-and todays U.S.-born second generation, with a median age of twelve, is poised to explode into adulthood in the coming ten to twenty years. They are coming of age in an otherwise aging society undergoing profound social and economic transformations, a process that is straining the social contract between natives and newcomers and raising questions about how the commitment to democratic values of equity and inclusion will be met (Myers 2007; Tienda 2002). The incorporation of these newcomers has coincided with a postindustrial period of economic restructuring and rising inequality, during which the returns to education and advanced educational credentials have sharply increased. Simultaneously, the U.S. labor market has become bifurcated into high-tech/high-wage and manual/low-wage sectors-attracting distinct streams of immigrant workers, from skilled professionals to undocumented laborers. As the post-World War II era of sustained economic growth, low unemployment, and rising real wages ended for most workers by the early 1970s, men with only a high-school degree or less were hardest hit. For example, the proportion of those workers who failed to earn enough in a year to support a family of four at the poverty line grew between 1975 and 1993 from 25 to 50 percent among Hispanics, from 31 to 45 percent among non-Hispanic blacks, and from 14 to 24 percent among non-Hispanic whites (Danziger 2004). Postsecondary schooling significantly lengthened for young people, with the years from eighteen to the mid- and even late twenties becoming increasingly devoted, often with continuing parental support, to the accumulation of human capital and college credentials. Many changes occurred at this time-women entered the labor market in large numbers and worked longer hours, two-income families became the norm, and the baby boom was followed by a baby bust and delayed childbearing. Additionally, there were changes in family forms, including what has come to be called a ""retreat from marriage,"" with high divorce rates (which peaked in 1980 but have remained high since) and sharp increases in cohabitation and nonmarital childbearing (Landale et al. 2006). In short, social timetables that were widely observed a half century ago for accomplishing adult transitions have become less predictable and more prolonged, diverse, and disordered (Settersten et al. 2005). The new era of mass immigration has also coincided with an era of mass imprisonment in the United States, which has further transformed paths to adulthood among young men with low levels of education (Pettit and Western 2004). The number of adults incarcerated in federal or state prisons or local jails in the United States skyrocketed during this period, quadrupling from over 500,000 in 1980 to 2.2 million in 2005 (U.S. Department of Justice 2006). The majority are young men between eighteen and thirty-four. Those figures do not include the much larger number of those on probation (convicted offenders not incarcerated) or parole (under community supervision after a period of incarceration). When they are added to the incarceration totals, over 7 million adults were under correctional supervision in the United States in 2006. Imprisonment rates vary widely by gender (over 90 percent of inmates in federal and state prisons are men); by racial-ethnic groups (there were 4,834 black male prisoners per 100,000 black males in the United States, compared to 1,778 Hispanic males per 100,000 and 681 white males per 100,000, although since 1985 Hispanics have been the fastest growing group being imprisoned); and by education. This is most salient among racial minorities for whom becoming a prisoner has become a modal life event in early adulthood. Stunningly, as Pettit and Western (2004) have noted, a black male high school dropout born in the late 1960s had a nearly 60 percent chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s, and recent birth cohorts of black men are more likely to have prison records than military records or bachelors degrees. Whether the future of Latino men without a high school diploma will approximate those patterns or not remains an open empirical question. During the years of the transition to adulthood from the late teens through the twenties, as postsecondary educational attainment has become critical to social mobility for both men and women, incarceration (for young men) and early childbearing (for young women) have emerged as two turning points- albeit fundamentally different ones-that can derail life course trajectories by blocking or disrupting educational and occupational opportunities to develop human capital and move into the economic mainstream. Having a prison record is not only linked to unemployment, lower wages, marital and family instability, and severe restrictions on social and voting rights (including lifetime disenfranchisement in many states), but also to stigmatized identities and pathways to criminal recidivism (Laub and Sampson 2003). In a cycle of cumulative disadvantage, young men and women with low levels of education are significantly more likely to become prisoners or young parents, respectively, than same-age and same-sex peers with higher levels of education. © 2010 by Rutgers University Press.

Additionally, a forum may be inactive for a long period and suddenly receive a burst of messages forcing forum mediators to frequently log on in order to know how the discussion is unfolding to intervene whenever it is necessary.

Among the various Biometric methods, Face recognition has become one of the most challenging tasks in the pattern recognition field in the past decades.

Face recognition is very important for many applications such as: video surveillance, criminal investigations and forensic applications, secure electronic banking, mobile phones, credit cards, secure access to buildings. For identifying individual in international traffic points, in access control and in many other fields it is very useful. At international traffic points, such as at the airport, where continuous search for a particular person is possible with the help of this system. With the help of smart cameras we can track and identify the person . In this paper we propose a novel face recognition method based on wavelet transform and fast discrete curvelet transform. Initially Wavelet transform is applied to the query image to get the subbands and then curvelet transform is applied for each subband images. Thus curvelet coefficients for each wavelet subbands are obtained. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.","Face database; Face recognition; Fast discrete curvelet transform; Wavelet transform","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860330464"

Anique and her daughter Clara (all names used are pseudonyms) left public housing in a high-poverty' high-crime neighborhood of South Los Angeles seven years ago. Since then' Anique has struggled to line up steady work and child care while bouncing from apartment to apartment in L.A.'s sprawling housing market. At one point' her daily commute was seventy miles each way' from Long Beach' where her mother and sister provided child care' to her job in Riverside County. But Anique had considerable work experience' and the skills and confidence that often come with that experience' at the time of her move. As we completed our visits with her in 2005' she and Clara were living in a neighborhood that felt safe' across the street from Anique's steady new job as a child support investigator with county government. Kimberlyn and her two teenaged boys also relocated from a public housing project in South Los Angeles to a much safer neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley. Kimberlyn credits that relocation-her ""last chance'"" she recalls-with getting her away from an abusive relationship. Although the new neighborhood provided safer' better schools for her sons' which Kimberlyn prized' she experienced racial harassment from white neighbors in her apartment complex. Plus' Kimberlyn was on welfare when she moved and had almost no work experience or credentials. When she could not or would not secure' in the Valley' the job training and other resources she knew she needed' she moved her family back to South Los Angeles and put her sons back into the much more disruptive and dangerous schools there. Kimberlyn has been unable to line up steady work and is back on welfare after stints as a security officer and brief spells in training. The child care her sister had provided in South Los Angeles abruptly disappeared' and her mother's needs are a major burden. For roughly half a century' policymakers and researchers have debated the impacts of place' and in particular of living in inner-city ghettos' on employment and self-sufficiency. Images of the welfaredependent or socially isolated ghetto poor' together with evidence of a spatial mismatch between increasingly decentralized job locations and the neighborhoods where low-skilled people are concentrated' fueled an interest in housing policy as a tool for shifting the ""geography of opportunity"" (Abrams 1955; Briggs 2005; Downs 1973; Wilson 1987). Created in 1974' the federal rental housing voucher program allows lowincome families to use government-provided housing subsidies to move away from poor and high-risk communities. Yet these families' minorities most of all' continue to face extraordinary barriers' such as racial discrimination' landlord refusal to accept the vouchers' the exclusion of affordable rental housing from more affluent and white communities' search costs' and more (Massey and Denton 1993; Pendall 2000; Turner 1998). Plus' some families have their own reasons for preferring poorer' more racially segregated areas to the unwelcome alternatives they perceive. Yet research on the long-run effects of programs that seek to expand housing choice by facilitating access to better neighborhoods-an approach known as ""assisted housing mobility""-has suggested that these efforts can improve the life outcomes of low-income' mostly minority adults and their children in several dimensions' including education' safety and security' mental health' employment' and self-sufficiency. Two programs' in particular' found their way to the headlines in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the unprecedented relocation it forced. In 1994' encouraging results from the Gautreaux housing desegregation program (Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000) spurred the federal government to invest $70 million in the randomized Moving to Opportunity experiment (MTO). At baseline' only about one-quarter of MTO adults were working; most were on welfare (Goering and Feins 2003). Although MTO was not designed to directly address participants' employment status or employability- including the barriers to work that low-skill single mothers often face-the experiment had the research-based expectation that if families moved to low-poverty neighborhoods' adults could become employed or get better jobs by moving closer to employment centers' developing more useful job networks (as a form of social capital) with more advantaged neighbors' and/or gaining momentum from an environment with stronger work norms. Controversial or not' realistic or not' these expectations were real' particularly in the minds of policymakers. Notwithstanding some encouraging evidence concerning early impacts of MTO on employment and welfare receipt at some sites' at the interim mark some four to seven years after random assignment' there were no generalized treatment effects on employment' earnings' or self-sufficiency (Orr et al. 2003). Significantly' though' more than twice as many MTO adults were working in all groups (Orr et al. 2003)-this over a period in which labor markets were tight and time limits on welfare assistance began to show effects-and many MTO families faced important barriers to work' in the form of chronic illnesses' lack of child care' and more (Popkin' Harris' and Cunningham 2001). So the market and entitlement reform effects may have swamped any treatment effect of MTO' at least in the short run. Moreover' by the interim point' many experimental-group families had moved on to somewhat poorer neighborhoods' for a range of reasons. Yet additional analyses of the interim impacts survey suggest that the employment picture may be more complex and mixed than initially thought' with positive effects for subgroups of adults or particular sites' and that interference and other challenges limit the experiment as a source of unbiased estimates of neighborhood effects' which are notoriously difficult to attribute. In this chapter' rather than estimate MTO treatment effects' we use qualitative and quantitative analyses to analyze how and why the mixed patterns obtain for employment. The focus of our qualitative work is nonexperimental analyses of causal mechanisms' including social processes' that tie place of residence to economic opportunity. We employ a mixed-method approach that is particularly crucial for advancing our understanding of the role that structural factors as well as choice play in the lives of the poor in a changing society (see Newman and Massengill 2006).

Unfortunately, this can often prove to be the case with our attempts to provide security. Just when we start to get a grip on the nature of the threats and what to look out for, the changing face of the technology we use can serve to confound our efforts. As the technologies change, they can enable old threats to persist in a new guise. Such a pattern has been seen many times with malware, which has managed to hijack a succession of new technologies (from email through to social networks, from desktops through to mobile devices), thus ensuring that as soon as users have been educated and trained to be aware of the threat in one context, it pops up in another that they are not expecting. A variety of technologies aims to simplify users' interactions with their devices and online services. Unfortunately, in some cases, there is potential for these to come at the expense of security and protection, or at least to amplify the risk from the user perspective. Prof Steven Furnell of Plymouth University examines the phenomenon and shows how these simplifications of the navigation experience can potentially be used to disguise malicious links. And he examines how the simplified online fraud protection to be found on some mobile devices can expose users to phishing threats. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","","Mobile devices; Malwares; On-line service; Phishing; Plymouth; Security and protection; Social Networks; Computer crime","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862685330"

The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed. © The Author(s) 2010.","rational choice; routine activities; script; sex offenders; situational crime prevention; target selection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955736816"

Results: Delinquent youth were found to be more sensitive to the environmental conditions exerted by community-level socioeconomic characteristics than their at-risk counterparts.

Among the steepest of such gradients is that of the United States' where there are large differences across people on measures of neighborhood environments' early childhood experiences' education' income' and housing quality. Persistent residential segregation of poor and minority populations has spurred a growing number of studies that investigate the effects of community background on a variety of socioeconomic outcomes. However' the role of the physical and socioeconomic neighborhood in contributing to health disparities has been relatively unexplored. Analyses of health disparities have instead focused largely on individual- And family- level determinants of health outcomes. Over the past decade' however' we have witnessed a renewed research and policy interest and recognition of the salience of nonmedical determinants of health' especially the socioeconomic determinants of health that derive from differential neighborhood quality (Schoeni et al. 2008). Previous research has shown that such individual health behaviors as cigarette smoking' alcohol use' diet' and exercise explain a relatively small amount of race and socioeconomic differences in health status (Lantz et al. 2001)' but it leaves open the question of the importance of parental socioeconomic status via its effect on access to neighborhood amenities. This chapter reports on recent research by the author on the influence of neighborhood conditions on health over the life course' with a particular focus on how childhood neighborhoods affect health later in life. In this research I take the perspective that disadvantaged neighbor- hood exposures may both accumulate and beget future exposures due to links between neighborhood characteristics and the socioeconomic mobility process. In particular' in the United States' there are substantial racial differences in the incidence and persistence of exposure to highpoverty neighborhoods (Johnson 2008b). Moreover' in terms of health' blacks can expect to live six fewer years than whites' and can expect to live more years with chronic health problems (Hayward and Heron 1999)' with most of the black-white difference in life expectancy stemming from racial differences in mortality rates prior to age 65. Racial disparities in neighborhood exposures' in childhood and adulthood' and the relationship between these disparities and those in health provide an important backdrop and motivation for this inquiry. Stressful neighborhood conditions due to high poverty rates' crime' violence' and weaker sources of social support may lead to increased risk of high blood pressure and accelerated rates of health deterioration more generally. There are well-known differences across neighborhoods in the amount of perceived safety; availability and quality of public spaces and recreational facilities; tobacco advertising; liquor stores; and availability and cost of nutritious foods. The empirical question is whether differences across neighborhoods in the prevalence of particular health conditions do in fact reflect causal processes operating over the life course. Given the known lengthy latency periods before most health effects manifest (e.g.' hypertension)' it is important to examine whether later-life racial health disparities are rooted in early-life childhood circumstances. It is also important to examine whether racial differences in adult health status are the result of a long-term cumulative process of socioeconomic environmental exposures over the life cycle. The selected studies highlighted in this chapter seek to identify causal influences on the life cycle trajectory of health inequality using innovative research designs to separate causal impacts of neighborhoods from correlations arising from familial selection into neighborhoods. The typical analytical approach used in neighborhood studies is to regress individual level outcomes such as health on neighborhood-level factors such as census tract mean income' poverty rates' or rates of single motherhood. But attempts to estimate causal effects of neighborhood context have faced well-documented challenges. The problem of endogeneity of residential location (in the form of ""selection bias"") has received perhaps the most attention in the literature (Manski 1993) and is a paramount concern because families choose where to live in part based on the characteristics they value. Thus' families who care more about investing in health-promoting activities may be less likely to choose to reside in a community with a poor health care system or high pollution. Many of the multidimensional aspects that influence residential location decisions are cannot be easily measured' which makes it particularly difficult to disentangle the causal influences of a child's family' school' and neighborhood. Few studies have used convincing identification strategies to overcome this challenge' exceptions being experimental evaluations such as Katz' Kling' and Liebman (2001) and Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn (2000). (See Gennetian et al. in this volume.) Other challenges also complicate attempts to examine causal effects of neighborhood context. One such challenge is the difficulty of obtaining accurate measures of neighborhood characteristics. Another problematic characteristic of many neighborhood studies is that they examine the relationship between contemporaneous health and neighborhood conditions without regard to changing circumstances during the life cycle or the persistence of exposure to neighborhood conditions. If exposure to neighborhood conditions at an earlier stage of the life cycle influences current health but is not accounted for' then the estimated relationship between contemporaneous neighborhoods and health may be misleading. Finally' causality between economic and health status runs in both directions in adulthood and has proven notoriously difficult to sort out empirically (Adda' Chandoln' and Marmot 2003). By focusing on childhood socioeconomic conditions' we can more easily identify causal impacts on subsequent health because reverse causality is a relatively minor concern (i.e' poor child health is not a significant factor in most cases that leads to low parental income or neighborhood disadvantage). The studies highlighted in this chapter employ a different approach than those typically used to address these challenges by exploiting a unique feature of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Specifically' the initial PSID sample in 1968 was highly clustered' with most original sample families having several other sample families living on the same block and who were subsequently followed over significant shares of the life course. This allows one to compare the similarity in adulthood health outcomes between siblings who grew up together versus unrelated individuals who grew up in the same narrowly defined neighborhood. Estimating the overall scope of any such causal links of neighborhood environments is of substantial policy importance because the residential locations of both the poor and the affluent are influenced by public policies related to crime' subsidized housing' zoning' tax subsidies for home ownership' and school districting' among other things. Moreover' understanding how the effects of neighborhood conditions differ over the life cycle is critical to helping policymakers develop interventions (e.g.' early childhood interventions or targeted policies for the geographic deconcentration of the poor) that build a bridge between childhood and early adulthood for impoverished families' so that fewer individuals arrive at the doorstep of retirement with accumulated exposures that are irreversible. In the next section' I provide an overview of the ways that neighborhoods' as well as families' may directly and indirectly affect an individual's health trajectory in adulthood and then summarize previous research on a number of topics relevant to my research. The third section lays out the methodological hurdles in estimating causal effects of neighborhood conditions' while the fourth summarizes recent research findings using innovative approaches that address these methodological challenges across a range of health outcomes over the life course. The final section discusses the policy implications and interventions that show the most promise to promote population health in order to build a more comprehensive and efficient health system.

Grounded in a recent study of the community impacts of hate crime, we offer some insights into these in terrorem effects of hate crime. We present here some of our qualitative findings. Interestingly, our findings suggest that, in many ways, awareness of violence directed toward another within an identifiable target group yields strikingly similar patterns of emotional and behavioural responses among vicarious victims. They, too, note a complex syndrome of reactions, including shock, anger, fear/vulnerability, inferiority, and a sense of the normativity of violence. And, like the proximal victim, the distal victims often engage in subsequent behavioural shifts, such as changing patterns of social interaction. On a positive note, there is also some evidence that these reactions can culminate not in withdrawal, but in the potential for community mobilization. © The Author(s) 2011.","community; harm; hate crime; in terrorem effects; victimization; vulnerability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864911631"

The aim of this chapter is to use information collected about the 130 policy debates from the RNGS study to explore propositions about framing as an important strategy for political actors and, in doing so, contribute to the accumulation of knowledge about movements, framing, and policy in political science. There are several strands of interest. In the last decade, the struggle over definitions and meanings of public policy moved to the center of the study of democracies (Gamson and Meyer 1996). Political ideas are not given; to the contrary, they are contested. Therefore, society-based groups and state actors align themselves with definitions of policy issues that might reflect their positions and aims. Political scientists have found that discourses, ideas, and frames are important sources of power. The struggle over their meaning (i.e., discursive politics) has increasingly become the focus of political analysis. This chapter considers different approaches to frame analysis and discursive policy analysis found in the fields of social and women's movement research (Zald 1996; Whittier 2002; Kenney 2003; Beckwith 2005; Schoen and Rein 1994; Snow and Benford 1992; Kingdon 1995), discursive institutionalism (Schmidt 2008), discursive policy analysis (Fischer 2003; Hajer and Wage-naar 2003), and feminist policy research (Bacchi 1999, 2005; Ferree et al. 2002; Squires 2005; Verloo and Lombardo 2007; Lombardo, Meier, and Verloo 2009a). Frames are ""organized ideas"" that provide at least some ""coherence to a designated set of elements"" (Ferree et al. 2002: 105). Framing organizes perceptions of social and political problems and gives meaning to specific situations and issues. In the studies of social movements, frames are seen as modes of defining problems and as structures of organized meanings (Snow and Benford 1992; Gamson 1988). Framing refers to the way in which actors define policy issues in terms of problems (diagnosis) and policy goals (prognosis) (Benford and Snow 2000; Zald 1996). Analysts agree that there is an important connection between the definition or framing of a policy problem and, eventually, policy outcomes (Schattschneider 1960; Kingdon 1995; Cobb and Elder 1983; Schneider and Ingram 1993; Muller 1990). Frames shape agenda-setting processes as well as decision making, and might also influence policy implementation. The opportunity to shape the overall idea of a policy gives power to collective actors from outside state institutions. They can, thus, insert their ideas into the policy process and realize their interests by changing the policy discourse and the underlying ideas in a specific policy environment in which the policy decisions are prepared. Such a change in framing constitutes one form of process change because it brings ideas and interests of new groups into the policy discourse and changes substantive representation. Moreover, outside actors are at the same time ""constructed"" as participants by the specific framing of an issue. In other words, a specific framing of an issue might mobilize collective action and allow these actors, and not others, to participate in a policy debate. Thus, since framing might open the door to power for women's movements, it becomes a political strategy to gain substantive and descriptive representation. Frames produce political action (Benford and Snow 2000: 631) and compose part of the cultural or discursive opportunity structure (Burstein 1999; Ferree et al. 2002). The cross-issue, cross-time, and cross-country analyses of this chapter seek to contribute to the fast-growing political science literature on framing by giving detailed empirical evidence on how women's movements and policies, as well as civil society and state, are connected through framing. As described more fully in Chapter 2, the research plan of the RNGS project discerns general frames, issue frames, and microframes. A general frame refers to wide-range definitions, that is, to a ""universe of political discourse"" (Jenson 1989), or what Bob Jessop (1994) calls the ""state project,"" for instance, the ""welfare state."" Gender equality might be such a wide general frame of the women's movement (Lombardo, Meier, and Verloo 2009a). The issue frame is the meaning of a specific policy area, used by actors in this specific policy subsystem in a specific policy debate, such as employment, health, or environment policy. Typical issue frames in abortion debates, for example, are health frames; in prostitution debates, we find crime frames. Such frames can be welcoming to the women's movement activists' ideas, or they can be hostile. A microframe is the position that specific actors, both inside and outside of the state (e.g., bureaucratic agencies, political parties, interest groups, and women's movements) seek to insert into the issue frame to change the definition of the issue and policy content. Microframes express discourses and ideas of individuals or organizations. Individuals and organizations in women's movements are such actors who, with their microframes, attempt to weigh into the debates at the level of the policy subsystem. The concept of state feminism used in this book places certain aspects of framing as indicators as well as drivers of women's movement success and agency effectiveness. For example, movement success is defined as the compatibility of policy content with movement microframes expressed in the debate. The compatibility of ideas of women's movement actors who take a position in a debate with the frames that characterize the given policy environment is explored as a central explanatory factor in the success of women's movements. Moreover, it is shown, in Part II of the book, that the role of women's policy agencies in mediating between women's movements and the policy environments may also be crucial-namely, the gendering or de-gendering of an issue by the agencies in a way that the perceptions of the issue by policy actors coincide with the movement frames in the debate (also see Ferree and Gam-son 2003). Women's policy agencies that effectively insert women's movement frames into policy debates are influential in enhancing Movement State Feminism in two respects: They facilitate the entry of women's movement actors in the policy arena, and they shape the policy outcome according to the women's movements ideas and goals. Alliances between women's movements and women's policy agencies are likely to occur through an agreement on frames-that is, on the definition of the policy issue at stake and on the vision of the policy solution. The state feminism framework also assumes that gendered issue frames help to put the aims of women's movement actors on the political agenda and that the gendering of an issue is important for the substantive and descriptive success of the women's movement. The major assumption is that frames are the ""glue"" to policy change, for the participation of women's movement actors, and for state feminism. The framing of a policy issue is a way to enhance the likelihood that women's movement actors will be able to change the content of a policy and to bring forward the quantitative representation of women in a policy arena. This chapter seeks to fill in the blanks relating to the content of women's movement framing in the RNGS policy debates, classifying the content of microframes expressed by women's movement actors.1 Then it uses information from the RNGS dataset to examine changes in issue frames and their relation to women's policy agency frames. While the role of framing is widely acknowledged in the political science literature, not much systematic empirical research has been conducted on the influence of frames in a policy process in which women's movements were involved. The first section investigates in detail how these frames attempt to gender policies in the issues of abortion, job training, prostitution, political representation, and hot issues of state restructuring over the last three decades. Did the frames change over time? Are there country-specific patterns of frames? Do clusters of countries exist that show commonalities in framing a specific policy issue and across the five issues? Are there specific groups of frames that shape specific issues? Case studies will show how women's movement actors brought issues onto the agenda by strategic framing of policy problems. Second, the chapter looks at patterns of the issue frames of policy actors. Given that changes in issue frames are an indication of cultural change inside the state, it explores patterns in the frames over time and whether cultural change toward gender equality has occurred. Is there cross-country variation in framing issues? To what extent were women's movements able to change frames in policy debates over time? What leads to a gendered or de-gendered issue frame? The third section examines the important nexus between women's movement microframes and policy actors' issue frames. The data on the congruence of these types of frames suggest factors that might explain the likelihood that women's movements microframes will be compatible with the frames used by policy actors and, thus, be more welcome in a specific policy environment. Finally, the chapter submits the major assumptions of the state feminism framework to empirical analysis. Are these assumptions warranted by the data from the debates? © 2010 by Temple University Press. All rights reserved.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901909538"

For the majority of adolescents, the problematic behaviors are limited to an experimentation period and are temporary. However, for some individuals, the first contacts with the disruptive behavior progress to more severe antisocial behavior patterns. The progression of the dissocial behavior from the childhood to the adolescence seems related to a difficult temperament, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, improper relationships with peers, precocious sexuality, poor parent-adolescent communication, arrests by delinquency and repetition. Traditionally, the dissocial behavior has been associated with low socioeconomic status, lack of public services, unemployment, marginalization and schools with unsuitable educational programs. However, current conceptualizations view this problem as much more complex. In communities that have covered the basic needs, even in those that possess a good quality of life, we can find children and adolescents with dissocial behavior that thereinafter become adults with antisocial personality. Therefore, during the last decades, research has displaced its attention from the structural variables to community (lack of attachment with the vicinity, social mobility, and population density), family (bonding, communication, supervision) and personal processes, favoring a biopsychosocial perspective to this problem. The aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model of dissocial behavior (as defined by the 27-item Dissocial Behavior Scale, ECODI27) based on the following predictor variables: a) Parent communication (Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale, PACS), b) Empathy (Interpersonal Relationship Index, IRI), c) Assertiveness (Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, RAS), d) Sensation seeking (Sensation Seeking Scale - Form V, SSS-V) and e) Risk socialization (Social Relationship Questionnaire, SRQ, created for this study) controlling for the impression management effect (Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding-version 6, BIDR-6). Method: A probability sample of adolescents, 14 to 17 years of age, living in two neighborhoods with high indexes of gangs and offenses was collected. Males were 112 and women 86, without statistical difference of frequencies (χ2 [1,N=196]=3.41, p=.06). All participants resided in San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Pearson's productmoment correlation, partial correlation and stepwise linear regression were used for data analysis. Results: There was a significant difference in dissocial behavior cases between male and female adolescents (χ2 [1,N=194]=14.75, p<.00), with Yates' correction: (χ2 [1,N=194]=12.59, p<.01). The percentage of cases is 18% in women and 45% in men. The total score of the 27-item Dissocial Behavior Scale (ECODI27) presented significant correlation with social desirability (.47 in men and .44 in women) and its factor of impression management (.53 in men and .47 in women). The self-deception factor was independent in men (r=.18, p=.06), but not in women (r=.26, p=.02). Higher dissocial behavior features were associated with lower scores on social desirability and its factors. The effect of the impression management factor had to be controlled for its statistical significance in men and women. Of the 18 variables of the social relationships questionnaire (SRQ) by the point-biserial correlation coefficient (dichotomic variables) and Pearson's product-moment correlation (ordinal and numerical variables), only four were significantly correlated to the ECODI27 total score: to belong (1) or not (2) to a gang outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.45, p<.01) and in the school (n=133, rpb=.35, p<.01), to have 1) or not 2) a friend group outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.20, p=.01), as well as to have 1) or not 2) a girlfriend or boyfriend in the school (n=131, rpb=.26, p=.02) and outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.18, p=.01). These correlations were positive, that is to say, acted as risk factors (lower score on ECODI27, more dissocial behavior). The variable of risk socialization was created with the sum of these five variables, giving more weight to the two variables of gangs by their higher correlations, so they are multiplied by two. The created variable has a range of 0 (not risk) to 7 (high risk). Of the 20 variables contemplated, nine presented significant correlation with dissocial behavior in men, after partializing the effect of the impression management: sensation seeking and its four factors (disinhibition, excitement seeking, emotion seeking and boredom susceptibility), risk socialization, total and open communication with the father and perspective taking. In women there were also nine significant variables: risk socialization, sensation seeking and its factors of disinhibition, boredom susceptibility and excitement seeking, total and open communication with the mother, total communication with the father and school grade. The regression models by sexes were calculated with the nine variables whose correlations with the ECODI27 total score resulted significant after partializing impression management. In men the calculation process ended in the fifth step. The model explained 49% of the variance of the ECODI27 total score and was significant (F [5,106]=21.99, p<.01). Five variables integrated the model: disinhibition (β=-.32), risk socialization (β=-.28), open communication with the father (β=.27), excitement seeking (β=-.20) and perspective taking (β=.16). In women the calculation process ended in the third step. The model explained 40% of the variance of the criterion and was significant (F [3,78]=19.38, p<.01). Three variables integrated it: total communication with the mother (β=.33), risk socialization (β=-32) and sensation seeking (β=-.28). Conclusions: The results of the present study can only be extrapolated to the population of the two studied neighborhoods and must be handled as generators of testable hypotheses in other similar populations. In addition, their self-report nature must be considered as an additional potential limitation. However, they indicate that the presence of dissocial behavior was high in the present sample, with an intermediate percentage (33%) between high school students (8.5%) and imprisoned offenders (50%). Risk socialization (engaging in gangs, friend group in the neighborhood and precocious sexuality), sensation seeking and little communication with the parent or tutor of the same sex than adolescent in men and women, as well as lack of perspective taking in men, were predictors of dissocial behavior. The sensation seeking was defined in the regression models by the SSS total score in women and by its factors of disinhibition and excitement seeking in men. These data make an attention call to the Council authorities of a propitiatory environment for dissocial behavior. From the obtained models, the intervention must be addressed to eradicate the phenomenon of the gangs; to encourage the internal control or planning and perspective taking in the pupils, through specific workshops within the school subjects of ethic or health care. They also call for the importance to work the open communication, above all with the parent or tutor of the same sex than the adolescent, through these workshops as well as during the meetings with the pupil's parents. Furthermore, to seek occupational-formative opportunities for those adolescents that have left the school seems critical, especially for those of 16-year-old or younger, considering the prohibition of working at that age.","Dissocial behavior; Empathy; Risk socialization; Sensation seeking; Social desirability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859831929"

Previous research in geographical criminology has revealed that: (1) the journey to crime is limited in distance and follows a distance decay pattern; (2) the home of the offender plays a central role as the starting point of crime trips; and (3) the direction of the trip is influenced by the opportunities to commit crimes. The findings are more or less accepted as 'laws' in the field. However, research on offender mobility is often limited by its method, data and sample of arrested offenders. This study, in contrast, investigated a sample of arrested foreign offenders (East Europeans) who were staying temporarily in Belgium. They lack the space awareness and routine activities of residential offenders. Using multiple methods and data, including police statistics, case file analysis and offender interviews, we investigated the travelling patterns of these offenders both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings demonstrate that: (1) the degree of distance decay is much more moderate than generally found in the literature; (2) the official living address plays hardly any role at all as an anchor point; and (3) these offenders travel away from opportunity structures, which is different from the routine activity patterns of Belgian offenders. Overall, our findings indicate that offender mobility does not fit the accepted general pattern or 'laws' as assumed in previous research. © The Author(s) 2012.","distance delay; foreign offenders; mobility","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861752036"

S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860640816"

Explaining the linkage between urban planning and crime patterns, Brantingham and Brantingham (1998b) argue that the spatial array and context of facilities (i.e., placement, juxtaposition, operation, and accessibility through high-volume traffic conduits) can account for the criminogenic capacity of certain places. Aggregating the usage of such places provides some indication of the dynamic interplay between the spatial and social context of the urban landscape that gives rise to crime patterns. Complicating the equation is the need to model the urban backcloth - the political, legal, and economic forces behind community planning and development - that generates the urban form, which ultimately shapes individual behaviors. It follows that crime problems can be better understood, and more effectively acted upon, by attending to the urban structure generated by routine behavior endemic to a specific region. © 2012 Martin A.

Q methodology occupies an interesting position in arguments around methodological pluralism in that its location within qualitative (as well as quantitative) traditions has often been represented as a contestable issue. To contextualise our exploration of qualitative methodological pluralism, we will begin by presenting the theoretical questions we see as relevant to the mixing of Q method with other qualitative methods, including Q's own contested positioning within this grouping. This strand of our argument highlights continuities between some conceptualisations of the pattern analytics of Q methodology and discursive and thematic analysis. To ground this point, we present an empirical study that used both Q methodology and thematic analysis to address an issue in the community. More specifically, we will describe how Q methodology and thematic analysis were used to approach the evaluation of a programme to reduce recidivism amongst offenders and thus offer practical solutions in an applied setting. We will conclude by reflecting on the possibilities of pluralism when methodological boundaries are understood as mobile, and when stability of boundary construction is conceptualised as relationally produced rather than pre-existing. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Methodological pluralism; Multiagency; Offender rehabilitation; Q methodology; Thematic analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79958184745"

The diagnosis views day labor as a public nuisance that imposes negative externalities on a locality by disrupting normal patterns of business, traffic, and pedestrian exchange. The remedy involves the enactment of new land use regulations, known as antisolicitation ordinances, designed to remove day laborers from the street comers-thereby undermining their ability to earn a living. Such ordinances regulate immigration indirectly by criminalizing conduct engaged in disproportionately by immigrant workers. Their proliferation, in turn, has invited a specific type of legal challenge focused on the deprivation of day laborers' First Amendment right to seek work. This Article examines a pivotal struggle in the national day labor movement: the two-decade long legal campaign to contest antisolicitation ordinances in the greater Los Angeles area. It asks whether and how litigation-often portrayed as a nemesis of social movements-has advanced the day laborers' cause. What it shows is that litigation has been an indispensMe social change tool in the fight for day laborers' rights, albeit one that carries inherent risk. On the positive side of the ledger, the Los Angeles day labor campaign has drawn upon strong legal capacity to mobilize a rights strategy, coordinated with grassroots organizing, against the backdrop of limited political options. It has thus avoided many of the familiar pitfalls of social change litigation in successfully challenging key ordinances. Yet, despite its success in preserving public space for day labor solicitation, the campaign's outcome rests in the hands of a federal appellate court, underscoring a fundamental social change reality: Even the most sophisticated litigation campaign ultimately hinges on the presence of sympathetic decisionmakers in the court of ultimate authority.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80054080462"

This study introduces the concept of ""forensic awareness"" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use. Methods: Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada. Results: Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness. Conclusion: Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649636707"

There are two main interests, namely source identification and forgery detection. Source identification focuses on identifying the source digital devices (cameras, mobile phones, camcorders, etc) using the media produced by them, while forgery detection attempts to discover evidence of tampering by assessing the authenticity of the digital media (audio clips, video clips, images, etc). In this paper, we propose a novel source camera identification method based on detection and matching of dustspot characteristics that settle in front of the imaging sensor create a persistent pattern in all captured images of digital single lens reflex camera. To prevent false detections, lens parameter dependent characteristics of dust spots are also taken into consideration. Experimental results show that the proposed detection scheme can be used in identification of the source digital single lens reflex camera at low false positive rates, even under heavy compression and down sampling.

Neighborhood inequality is also implicated in studies of enduring race/ethnic health disparities, and there are recent moves to broaden the definition of health care policy to policies targeting social inequality (Mechanic 2007). Residential segregation affects health outcomes in several different ways. First, income, education, and occupation are all strongly related to health (Adler and Newman 2002). Segregation is a key mechanism through which socioeconomic inequality is perpetuated and reinforced, as it hinders the upward mobility of disadvantaged groups by limiting their educational and employment opportunities. Second, segregation increases minority exposure to unhealthy neighborhood environments. Residential segregation creates areas with concentrated poverty and unemployment, both of which are key factors that predict violence and create racial differences in homicide (Samson and Wilson 1995). Neighborhood characteristics, such as exposure to environmental hazards, fear of violence, and access to grocery stores, affect health risks and health behaviors (Cheadle et al. 1991). Tobacco and alcohol industries also advertise their products disproportionately in poor, minority areas (Moore, Williams, and Qualls 1996). Finally, residential segregation leads to inequalitie in health care resources, which contributes to disparities in quality of treatment (Smedley, Stith, and Nelson 2002). One strategy for reducing health disparities among ethnic groups, particularly among blacks and whites, would be to reduce or eliminate racial residential segregation and the corresponding geographic concentration of poverty. Currently, we have a number of programs in place that are designed, directly or indirectly, to affect the socio-demographic characteristics of neighborhoods (e.g., FHA low-income mortgage loans, Hope VI mixed income housing developments, and Section 8 housing vouchers). However, despite almost a century of neighborhood research, social scientists do not know what forces maintain segregation, what the respective strengths of these forces are, or how they combine. In the absence of theoretical and empirical knowledge of how segregation works, it is difficult to effectively evaluate the short-run effectiveness of policies, let alone their long-run equilibrium consequences. Moreover, without some understanding of the global impact of these housing policies, interventions may be ineffective, or worse yet produce unintended consequences that exacerbate problems of concentrated poverty. Examples of unintended consequences include the exploding crime rates in mid-sized cities which have been linked to the anti-poverty programs Hope IV and Section 8 (see Rosin 2008; Galster 2003; Bostic and Lee 2008). Neighborhood formation and change is one example of a process in which collective dynamics emerge from the behavior of individual agents, mediated through interaction and aggregation. People who exit a neighborhood because they cannot tolerate its ethnic composition are both responding to and modifying neighborhood ethnic composition. This leads to a ""spiral"" or ""domino effect"" whereby small changes in neighborhood composition amplify and result in unexpected and extreme segregation. This is true even when people have relatively mild preferences for their own group (Schelling 1971, 1978). A number of health problems share these features of dynamic interdependence and feedback, including the spread of obesity, the development of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis and Staph infections, and the recent increase in HIV infection rates following the development of more effective antiviral treatments (see La Berge 2008; Elford 2006; Fong and Drlica 2003; Palumbi 2001; Lightfoot et al. 2005). Existing methods for studying this type of process have not been successful in developing effective mechanisms for change. Such processes have been dubbed ""policy resistant,"" as attempts at interventions often fail due to the response of the system to the intervention (Sterman 2006). My work blends empirical, analytic, and computational methods in an effort to develop a body of theoretical knowledge and corresponding agent-based model that can identify a few mechanisms central to maintaining segregated neighborhoods. The model incorporates information about how individuals discover and evaluate potential destinations, the relationship between decisions about where to live and aggregate patterns of segregation, and an understanding of how policies aimed at reducing segregation affect mobility behavior. The research is iterative, with model validation providing clues into what might be misspecified or missing from the behavioral or agent-based models, resulting adjustments of the behavioral and agent-based models, and subsequent reevaluation. Provided the agent-based model can reproduce key features of neighborhood turnover in different cities, my hope is that it will be useful in the development and evaluation of alternative policies for reducing segregation. Along the way, the model will provide useful information including how people respond to their environment under conditions of change and uncertainty, the relationship between mobility patterns, economic inequalities among ethic groups, and racial segregation, how segregation dynamics scale with population size, and the effect of government interventions such as public housing and housing vouchers on mobility patterns and the housing market. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","","Behavioral research; Chemical industry; Computational methods; Crime; Dynamics; Forecasting; Health; Health care; Health hazards; Housing; Knowledge based systems; Population statistics; Segregation (metallography); Urban planning; Agent-based model; Alcohol industry; Antiviral treatments; Collective dynamics; Disadvantaged groups; Domino effects; Drug-resistant strains; Economic inequality; Effective mechanisms; Empirical knowledge; Employment opportunities; Environmental hazards; Ethnic groups; Existing method; Global impacts; Government intervention; Grocery stores; Health outcomes; Healthcare resources; HIV infection; Housing development; Housing markets; Housing policy; Individual agent; Key factors; Key feature; Mobility behavior; Mobility pattern; Model validation; Mortgage loans; Neighborhood environment; Population sizes; Public housing; Racial difference; Residential segregation; Schelling; Segregation dynamics; Segregation process; Social inequalities; Social problems; Social scientists; Socio-demographic characteristics; Unintended consequences; Williams; Health risks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650384231"

We link outbound offending to a number of features that may explain crime travelling, including the target's features and offender/offence features. We find that outbound offending mostly occurs towards affluent target regions and near motorways, as such confirming findings from previous research. We also find crime sprees to be indicative for mobile offending. Thus, mobile property offenders tend to compensate for travelled distances, not only by targeting affluent areas and using fast transportation means, but also by committing several successive offences, hereby reducing their relative transportation cost for each offence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Criminology; Offender mobility; Property crime","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951580912"

This is undoubtedly a key challenge for Brazilian development because it has a direct impact on economic and political life, contributes to the deterioration of and limits access to public health and education services, and greatly reduces employment opportunities for those living in high-risk areas. One of the most noxious effects of violence is that the climate of fear and distrust it generates limits people's freedom, restricting mobility in certain urban areas, rendering ineffective self and external policing mechanisms. And the effect on family life is devastating: violence has led to the breakdown of thousands of homes. This chapter looks at homicide in Brazil, using accumulated data covering large areas and population. Various studies have attempted to explain why rates of violent crime vary between cities, metropolitan areas, or states, and have correlated such variations with social, demographic, and economic variables.1 A study of homicide in the U.S., for instance, lists the following factors, starting with the most important: high economic disparities or inequality, population structures and density (the larger areas with the densest population have the highest homicide rates), and high unemployment rates.2 Various authors have tested the idea that socioeconomic inequality in specific areas, regions, and cities helps to explain the distribution of homicide rates in Brazil. They have pointed to the relevance of economic cycles,3 poverty,4 and income and other economic variables related to inequality or investment in public safety at the city level.5 The central role of firearms in violence in Brazil is alarming. According to international comparisons of firearm deaths undertaken by the World Health Organization, which take total population into account,6 out of twenty-two ranked countries Brazil comes second in the number of homicides caused by firearms and first in juvenile firearm deaths. International data indicate not only the extremely high level of lethal violence in Brazil (over 70 percent of homicides were committed with firearms, as compared with around 10 percent for the other countries in the group), but also the predominance of the use of firearms in the resolution of conflicts. Research and studies about the regional determinants of firearm deaths allow us to understand better the demand for and potential benefits of national and regional policies to control firearms and ammunition effectively, and to reduce legal and black market supply and demand. Thus, the aim of this chapter is to look at the incidence of homicides committed with firearms and to examine the extent to which regional variations can explain variations in the homicide rate. For the period 1980-2000, the relevant regional variations include cultural traits and patterns of conflict and control specific to each region. However, rather than using the ""subcultures of violence"" argument,7 the chapter looks at theories of social disorganization and control.8 One can analyze regions with historically high rates of firearm homicides in light of social disorganization resulting from land disputes where there are no formal con trol mechanisms. In such contexts, the resolution of conflicts through honor and traditional social behavior patterns replace formal and informal control mechanisms.9 Curiously, these patterns emerge also in metropolitan areas, particularly those dominated by armed groups that are fighting for territorial control of urban centers. Looking at rates of homicide is, then, a way of understanding the diversity of experiences in Brazil. We have yet to take into account the level of diversity of experiences within large urban centers. The phenomenon most closely associated with the rise of homicides in Brazil is urbanization. Strictly speaking, it can be said that, as in other countries, violent crime is an urban phenomenon associated with processes of disorganization and the deterioration of control mechanisms in Brazilian urban centers.10 There are various competing theories about the links between homicide and urban dynamics. One pioneering theory proposed by the Chicago School is the so-called social disorganization theory. It analyses different territories within cities and the association between social disorganization and violence, transition zones and criminality, and urban violence and youth.11 This disorganization was observed in some areas of cities in the U.S., where the absence or decadence of traditional values was a cause of moral and family crisis, which in turn led to criminality. Such territories became sui generis regions of sorts, in which social order was not clearly defined. Conflicts emerge, then, in deteriorated communities, characterized by constant changes in the population and intense mobility. In other words, these are areas lacking any kind of infrastructure. Together, these facts led to a transition process culminating in criminal activities by adolescent gangs. These gangs are part of the poverty belt of communities constituted by people who live in a socioeconomic ""transition zone."" The theory of social disorganization, for instance, assumes that delinquency is a group rather than an individual phenomenon, and that community social disorganization makes it hard to control youth groups. Another interpretation is proposed by strain theory, which assumes that deviance is the result of pressures caused by social structure. It is classified as a ""systematic approach of social and cultural sources of a nonconformist behavior."" 12 The emphasis that society places on cultural objectives can, and frequently is, much greater than the attention focused on means that the cultural targets recognize as socially valid. We have then a polarizing system, which varies the emphases on these two moments; balance would correspond to a situation in which the social satisfactions provided adjust to both pressures. Merton, for instance, argues that delinquency emerges when it is impossible to attain socially expected levels of consumption. The gap between aspirations, inflated in a consumer society, and achievements, limited by inequality and poverty, are the main explanation for crime. Subcultural13 and learning theories,14 on the other hand, argue that deviance and crime are social or cultural products that do not necessarily emerge as a result of disorganized social structures, but rather as a result of the division of society into different groups which pursue their own goals-goals that are set independently of the mainstream or dominant culture. Once the use of violence has been normatively indicated, the counter-norm will be nonviolence. The individual that belongs to a community where violence is the established means to resolve conflicts will be ostracized or treated with indifference if they do not use violence ""appropriately. "" This kind of social pressure foments adherence to subcultural values in which aggression is considered the usual means to deal with conflict. The hypothesis is that the open use of violence is part of a normative subcultural system which has ramifications on the individual psyche. Thus, the individual is forced to behave according to the norms of the social group to which they belong. Further, in addition to being socialized according to established standards, behavior is submitted to various types of control. On the one hand, the group makes a certain kind of behavior possible, promoting the acquisition of abilities, values, expectations, and objectives; and on the other hand, the group makes the individual behave in a suitable manner. Criminal or delinquent behavior is the result of belonging to a social group in both senses. In contrast with theories in which crime is seen as a consequence of poorly integrated or collapsed systems, in social control theory, crime is a consequence of failed mechanisms of social control, in turn the result of conjunctural crisis or imperative tendencies in modern society.15 Theories of social control emphasize the role of the family, school, religion, and other institutions in the prevention of crime in general and in juvenile delinquency in particular. Crime and delinquency are linked to the failure of the institutions responsible for the social control, so that researchers focus on incomplete families, the absence of parental orientation, or school truancy, among other such factors. These factors should be studied together with learning and socialization theories on the basis of the notion, crudely put, that ""family, school, and church"" teach citizenship, while ""the streets"" teach crime and delinquency. These theories are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, socioeconomic factors are a feature they all share. The empirical data used to confirm this hypothesis covers Brazil as a whole, five regions, twenty-six states and their respective capitals, and the Federal District. The population data used here is gathered from the official site of the Brazilian Health Ministry.16 Data on homicides are from the Health Ministry's Mortality Information System. These data cover the period between 1980 and 2002. The information is coded according to the International Disease Classification (IDC), Revision IX (for 1980-1995), and Revision X (for 1996-2002).

In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour. © The Author(s) 2010.","Criminal behaviour; Deviance; Norms; Quantitative methodology; Rational choice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951648102"

While these networks possess numerous advantages over traditional wireless systems in dynamic environments they are still vulnerable to many of the same types of host-based and distributed attacks common to those systems. Unfortunately, the limited power and bandwidth available in WSNs and MANETs, combined with the dynamic connectivity that is a defining characteristic of the technology, makes it extremely difficult to utilize traditional intrusion detection techniques. This paper describes an approach to accurately and efficiently detect potentially damaging activity in WSNs and MANETs. It enables the network as a whole to recognize attacks, anomalies, and potential vulnerabilities in a distributive manner that reflects the autonomic processes of biological systems. Each component of the network recognizes activity in its local environment and then contributes to the overall situational awareness of the entire system. The approach utilizes agent-based swarm intelligence to adaptively identify potential data sources on each node and on adjacent nodes throughout the network. The swarm agents then self-organize into modular neural networks that utilize a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify relevant behavior patterns in the data without supervision. Once the modular neural networks have established interconnectivity both locally and with neighboring nodes the analysis of events within the network can be conducted collectively in real-time. The approach has been shown to be extremely effective in identifying distributed network attacks © 2011 SPIE.","Emergent behavior; Intrusion defense; Neural networks; Swarm intelligence","Cellular automata; Computation theory; Computer crime; Financial data processing; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Mobile ad hoc networks; Neural networks; Wireless sensor networks; Adjacent nodes; Agent based; Behavior patterns; Critical applications; Data source; Detection technique; Distributed attack; Distributed networks; Dynamic environments; Emergent behaviors; Entire system; Host-based; Interconnectivity; Intrusion defense; Local environments; Modular neural networks; Neighboring nodes; Self-organize; Situational awareness; Swarm agents; Swarm Intelligence; Wireless systems; Ad hoc networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960500621"

Together with the contributions from Dalmasso and Kandil, it exploits the opportunity created by the Arab uprisings to shed new light on patterns of social mobilization and collective action that research programmes focusing on authoritarian resilience had tended to overlook. Specifically, it presents an analysis that critically and loosely borrows from, communicates with and hopes to make a modest contribution to social movement theory (SMT). While threat and opportunity are necessary elements for popular mobilization, they are not sufficient. Both 'threat' and 'opportunity' therefore need to be contextualized within the specific social and political environment, real or perceived, of the 'early risers' in Syria, in order to appreciate their local significance. The article further argues that protestors, when under threat and faced with the opportunity, collectively rose up by capitalizing on their dense social networks. Strong clan-based or tribal social structures, circular labour migration, cross-border linkages and proliferating practices denoted as 'criminal' variably played a key role in cementing these social networks. It is also contended that these networks' ability easily to dissolve into one another due to their high degree of interconnectedness was instrumental in collective mobilization and their ability to pose a strong and enduring challenge to the regime. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","Syrian Arab Republic; collective action; mobility; social movement; social network","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864687959"

This paper considers forces responsible for the cyclical pattern of state expenditure and revenue. Annual fluctuations in state personal income are associated with small changes in state spending and significant changes in tax receipts; receipt of federal grants is associated with greater state spending. Tax collections, and to a lesser degree expenditure, of larger states are more closely associated with annual income fluctuations than are the tax collections and expenditure of smaller states. These state size differences may proxy for other state characteristics, such as the extent to which a state faces interstate competition for mobile businesses and individuals, and the quality of state government. The spending and tax revenue of states with less mobile populations closely track income fluctuations, as does spending in states where convictions of public officials for federal corruption crimes are more common. In small states, and in states with more mobile populations and better corruption records, government expenditure and revenue appear to rise and fall less with income, and in that respect more closely resemble the federal government.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051601218"

This makes it harder to detect and react upon malware attacks if using conventional techniques. In this paper, we propose an Android Application Sandbox (AASandbox) which is able to perform both static and dynamic analysis on Android programs to automatically detect suspicious applications. Static analysis scans the software for malicious patterns without installing it. Dynamic analysis executes the application in a fully isolated environment, i.e. sandbox, which intervenes and logs low-level interactions with the system for further analysis. Both the sandbox and the detection algorithms can be deployed in the cloud, providing a fast and distributed detection of suspicious software in a mobile software store akin to Google's Android Market. Additionally, AASandbox might be used to improve the efficiency of classical anti-virus applications available for the Android operating system. ©2010 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Computer operating systems; Dynamic analysis; Mobile devices; Robots; Viruses; Android markets; Anti virus; Computational power; Conventional techniques; Detection algorithm; Distributed detection; Linux kernel; Malware attacks; Mobile softwares; New applications; Operating systems; Smart-phones; Software detection; Static and dynamic analysis; Static analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78651410113"

Efforts to maintain, and expand, the voucher program should be based on the program's proven ability to provide decent and affordable housing rather than on unproven claims that it promotes poverty deconcentration and family self-sufficiency.

One can receive email on a PC, Laptop or mobile phone. SMTP was designed to be an easy and cost-effective implementation. This fact, however, makes SMTP a target to be abused. Unsolicited electronic communication, also known as spam, is just one such example of abuse of email. Tracing the origin of spam by using the information contained in SMTP headers is not possible because SMTP is a clear text protocol and can easily be intercepted and modified. Digital forensic specialists are plagued with sifting through large data sets to find incident information. During the process of introducing digital forensic readiness the amount of information that is gathered is inadvertently increased, to ensure that the information is valid and usable. Drawing from the experience of digital forensic experts to find specific data subsets that prove or disprove that an incident occurred can be used to automate the analysis process. Data analysis tools are created for the purpose of sifting through data, looking for known data patterns, and storing these patterns as a subset of the original data. Monitoring tools have been used successfully to gather information pertaining to the performance of IT systems. Security monitoring tools have been designed to collect security information in order to detect security breaches within the IT system. An extension to the security monitoring tool is proposed to gather security and usage information with regard to electronic communication.

Benchmarking is seen essential to rate those devices according to their usefulness for investigating crime scenes. Our main contribution is a revised version of our extensible framework for methodological benchmarking of contact-less fingerprint scanners using a collection of extensible categories and items. The suggested main categories describing a contact-less fingerprint scanner are properties of forensic country-specific legal requirements, technical properties, application-related aspects, input sensory technology, pre-processing algorithm, tested object and materials. Using those it is possible to benchmark fingerprint scanners and describe the setup and the resulting data. Additionally, benchmarking profiles for different usage scenarios are defined. First results for all suggested benchmarking properties, which will be presented in detail in the final paper, were gained using an industrial device (FRT MicroProf200) and conducting 18 tests on 10 different materials.","Benchmarking; Contact-less optical sensors; Latent fingerprints","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Crime; Mobile devices; Optical sensors; Pattern recognition; Portable equipment; Technology transfer; Benchmarking methodology; Benchmarking property; Collection process; Contact-less optical sensors; Crime scenes; Extensible framework; Forensic investigation; Industrial devices; Latent fingerprints; Legal requirements; Localisation; Mobile contacts; Pre-processing; Pre-processing algorithms; Sensory technologies; Technical properties; Tested objects; Usage scenarios; White light; Scanning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79953012483"

Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s.

Two case studies of young people's play practices involving digital games in Cape Town suggest the fragmentation and inequalities of contemporary play practices and the need for a more inclusive understanding of digital gaming. Mobile phones offer more accessibility than other digital gaming platforms and local appropriations include display of micro-commodities, concealment of outdated technology, control strategies and deletion of functionality. Young people move between multiple overlapping communicative spaces and hence complex cultural articulations arise when global game narratives are appropriated to make sense of racial otherness, crime and politics in South Africa. Since educational curricula cater for highly fractured publics, we ask whether it is advisable to speak of 'game literacy'.

To investigate the effects of mobility, we use a simulator to compare encounters between devices with those inferred by scanners.

This paper focuses on locating a limited set of fixed and mobile radiation sensors in a transportation network, with the intent to maximize the expected information gain and minimize the estimation error for the subsequent nuclear material detection stage.

The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. In addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements - the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention - to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime.

However, other assessments of racial stratification in American society suggest at least as much durability as change in Black social mobility since the 1980s. Our goal is to assess how patterns of racial disparity in violent crime and incarceration have changed from 1980 to 2008. We argue that prior studies showing a shrinking Black share of violent crime might be in error because of reliance on White and Black national crime statistics that are confounded with Hispanic offenders, whose numbers have been increasing rapidly and whose violence rates are higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks. Using 1980-2008 California and New York arrest data to adjust for this ""Hispanic effect"" in national Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data, we assess whether the observed national decline in racial disparities in violent crime is an artifact of the growth in Hispanic populations and offenders. Results suggest that little overall change has occurred in the Black share of violent offending in both UCR and NCVS estimates during the last 30 years. In addition, racial imbalances in arrest versus incarceration levels across the index violent crimes are both small and comparably sized across the study period. We conclude by discussing the consistency of these findings with trends in economic and social integration of Blacks in American society during the past 50 years. © 2011 American Society of Criminology.","Disparities; Hispanics; Incarceration; Race; Trends; Violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951980566"

Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior.

One particular serious attack, known as Sybil attack, against ad hoc networks involves an attacker illegitimately claiming multiple identities. In this paper, we present a simple security scheme, based on the difference in movement patterns of Sybil nodes and normal nodes, for detecting Sybil nodes in VANET. Our approach is distributed in nature because all nodes contribute for detection of Sybil nodes in VANET and it scales well in an expanding network. In this approach, each Road Side Unit (RSU) calculates and stores different parameter values (Received Signal Strength, distance, angle) after receiving the beacon packets from nearby vehicles. The combination of the parameters makes our detection approach highly accurate. After a significant observation period, these RSUs exchange their records and calculate the difference of the parameters. If some nodes have same values for the parameters during this observation period, these nodes are classified as Sybil nodes. Our preliminary simulation results show 99% accuracy and approximately 0.5% error rate, lower as compared to existing techniques.

This, in turn, often requires the reconstruction of mobility patterns. However, real-time surveillance is often difficult and costly to conduct, especially in criminal scenarios where such process needs to take place clandestinely. In this paper, we consider a vehicular tracking scenario and we propose an offline post hoc vehicular trace reconstruction mechanism that can accurately reconstruct vehicular mobility traces of a target entity by fusing the corresponding available visual and radio-frequency surveillance data. The algorithm provides a probabilistic treatment to the problem of incomplete data by means of Bayesian inference. In particular, we realize that it is very likely that a reconstructed route of a target entity will contain gaps (due to missing trace data), so we try to probabilistically fill these gaps. This allows law enforcement agents to conduct off-line tracking while characterizing the quality of available evidence. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Bayesian; Fusion; Scene Reconstruction; Trace; Tracking; Vehicular","Ad hoc networks; Bayesian networks; Computer crime; Inference engines; Repair; Thermal conductivity; Bayesian networks; Data fusion; Fusion reactions; Inference engines; Surface discharges; Bayesian fusion; Bayesian inference; Crime investigation; Digital evidence; Digital forensic; Geolocations; Incomplete data; Mobility pattern; Offline; Probabilistic treatments; Process needs; Radio frequencies; Real-time surveillance; Scene reconstruction; Surveillance data; Trace data; Visual data; Bayesian; Crime investigation; Probabilistic treatments; Real-time surveillance; Scene reconstruction; Trace; Vehicular; Vehicular mobilities; Target tracking; Target tracking","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954635868"

Focusing on the perceived influence of the European treaties on national legislation on abortion, two different types of Euro-scepticism can be discerned. One is settled in a potentially universal project of ‘enlightenment’ (fearing the ‘criminalisation’ of abortion due to EU (European Union) regulations), the other is concerned with the defence of the nation's democratic sovereignty against the EU (and fears ‘liberalisation’ of abortion due to the same EU regulations). A discourse analysis of these two different settings establishes the ‘discursive dynamics’ of each campaign: How were actors constituted (into ‘legitimate’ actors) and how could the (differing) interpretations of EU treaty provisions become plausible and constitute into different national discourses? Instead of perceiving social variables (norms, rules, identities) as ‘independent’ factors that explain outcomes, the social process of their constitution is at the centre of this analysis. Understanding how and when certain actors and certain topics (or problematiques) come into being (are ‘constituted’) may, in turn, allow some ‘reasoned claims’ on the character of popular Euro-scepticism. © 2010, European Consortium for Political Research.

Our main objective is to identify push and pull factors that will help us understand how and why criminal groups, organisations or general organised crime patterns are present across a variety of settings (i.e. geographical locations, criminal markets and legitimate industries). Push factors refer to forces which drive criminal groups from a setting. Pull factors refer to forces which draw criminal groups to a setting. A distinction is also made between contexts in which offenders organise around available opportunities (the strategic context) and contexts in which opportunities induce greater organisational levels amongst offenders (the emergent context). The most general statement that can be formulated from the present exercise is that opportunities matter more than the group itself. What we demonstrate is that the problems concerning geographical locations, criminal markets and legitimate industries that are vulnerable to organised crime are persistent and stable over time. Groups that seize such opportunities, on the other hand, are transient and more than often short-lived. Aside from reviewing past research in search of such factors, we also apply the general understanding that emerges from our analysis to critically assess case studies that reflect popular images of organised crime threats in Canada during recent years.

Simulation models assist in understanding this relationship by contextualizing residential mobility within a theoretical framework. The objective of this study is to model these migration patterns created by the interaction between changes in the social structure of households and the positive or negative social attractors in the neighborhood. Specifically, this study links residential mobility to the dynamic interplay between the micro-environment existing within a household and the meso-environment that structures a neighborhood. The cellular automata model developed in this study incorporates transition rules which govern households in their decision to move. The results represented by a cellular grid demonstrate that residential mobility is significantly influenced by density rates, individual household factors and neighborhood attractors. Three contrasting scenarios are presented in this paper to illustrate the impact of occupancy, density, neighborhood social influence, and the effect of a conglomeration of negative social attractors in a neighborhood. Future iterations of this model will incorporate census and crime data in order to test whether the rules governing this model are an accurate reflection of residential mobility in a mid-sized Canadian city. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cellular automata; Computational modeling; Crime attractor; Residential migration; Social influence; Urban density","Automata theory; Cellular automata; Crime; Dynamical systems; Pattern recognition systems; Cellular automata models; Complex Processes; Computational modeling; Crime data; Migration patterns; Residential migration; Residential mobility; Simulation model; Social dynamics; Social influence; Social structure; Theoretical framework; Transition rule; Urban density; Computer simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956011870"

In the proposed approach, time-stamped security data is continuously monitored within the target mobile device (i.e., smartphones, PDAs) and then processed by the knowledge-based temporal abstraction (KBTA) methodology. Using KBTA, continuously measured data (e.g., the number of sent SMSs) and events (e.g., software installation) are integrated with a mobile device security domain knowledge-base (i.e., an ontology for abstracting meaningful patterns from raw, time-oriented security data), to create higher level, time-oriented concepts and patterns, also known as temporal abstractions. Automatically-generated temporal abstractions are then monitored to detect suspicious temporal patterns and to issue an alert. These patterns are compatible with a set of predefined classes of malware as defined by a security expert (or the owner) employing a set of time and value constraints. The goal is to identify malicious behavior that other defensive technologies (e.g., antivirus or firewall) failed to detect. Since the abstraction derivation process is complex, the KBTA method was adapted for mobile devices that are limited in resources (i.e., CPU, memory, battery). To evaluate the proposed modified KBTA method a lightweight host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS), combined with central management capabilities for Android-based mobile phones, was developed. Evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the new approach in detecting malicious applications on mobile devices (detection rate above 94% in most scenarios) and the feasibility of running such a system on mobile devices (CPU consumption was 3% on average). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This has led the police to organise themselves to concentrate their resources in highly populated, urban areas. Over the last decade mobile property offenders have been found in various Western European countries that differ from this norm. These groups of mainly Eastern European multiple offenders engaging in property crime tend to travel further than other offenders. As such, their operations differ from most criminals, challenging the way the police are organised and undermining criminological theories on journey to crime. The aim of this paper is to look at the specificity of mobility patterns of these groups, to examine the precise interpretation of their mobility and to consider the implications. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the Belgian police database containing all serious property crimes in Belgium for the period 2002-2006. Some basic offender characteristics have been identified and for these offenders journey-to-crime patterns have been established. Findings: Eastern European multiple offending groups tend to commit their crimes in rural areas. Although they start their journey in regions considered ""crime importing"", they carry out their crimes in ""crime exporting"" areas. As such, they are atypical, challenging traditional theories on journey-to-crime and the way in which police forces are organised. Research limitations/implications: Observing a special group is one thing, but explaining these differences is another. Further research is needed, in particular with regard to the motivational aspects for these offenders. Originality/value: Whereas most researchers have found crime (including property crime) to be mainly local, the present research focuses on more mobile offenders. The challenges that these groups create for law enforcement authorities make it important for them and their patterns of activity to be understood. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behaviour; Crime research; Criminals","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952926543"

The study goes beyond previous research by using fixed effects to control for family factors that may influence moving behavior and confound estimates of gender differences in program impacts. Results showed that children experienced a decline in exposure to danger, with one key gender difference. Models based on brother-sister comparisons indicated that MTO had a more beneficial impact on exposure to drug activity for females than males. The findings suggest that neighborhood poverty is tied to children's exposure to danger.

Does the influence of these factors differ by immigrant characteristics? What are the factors associated with the observed increase in immigrant geographic dispersion during the 1990s? Our analysis suggests that: (1) There is significant heterogeneity in the correlates of immigrant location and migration choices; associations vary by immigrant birthplace, age, gender, education, and duration of residence in the United States. (2) Economic factors are, for the most part, weakly associated with immigrant location decisions. (3) Immigrants appear to be more attracted to states with large (growing) populations; less attracted to states with a high proportion of other foreign-born persons; more attracted to states with high unionization, and less attracted to states with high crime. (4) The association between location-specific characteristics and immigrant location choices changed between 1990 and 2000 for some immigrant groups and this explains most of the increase in geographic dispersion during the 1990s.

The secrecy of the communication can be achieved via secure PHY layers or by using crypto techniques which need a pre-shared secret between the sender and the legal receiver. A technique has been proposed in literature to avoid preshared secrets based on the noise-pattern of the radio channel. However, when the channel frequency selectivity is low or the eavesdropper is located near to the victim, the key exchange may fail to achieve security. The eavesdropper can gain access to the secure communication and steal the identity of one of the two communicating nodes. In this paper, a technique for identity theft detection is proposed: the receiving node can detect unintended change of sender's identity. A Feed-Foward Neural Network is used to identify the non-linearities of the OFDM radio transceiver which are unique and characteristic of the transmitting and receiving devices. The simulation results show that the NN correctly detects the non linearities coefficients for pedestrian and high mobility terminals in the presence of severe fading and noise, providing a strong mean for radio signal identification to detect broken security. © 2011 IEEE.","","Communication; Crime; Fading (radio); Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Telecommunication systems; Channel frequencies; High mobility; Identity theft; Key exchange; Non-Linearity; OFDM systems; Radio channels; Radio signals; Radio transceivers; Receiving nodes; Secure communications; Simulation result; Neural networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052173460"

The complaints cover the gamut of urban colonial commerce, from mundane local exchanges to ambitious and high-value ventures aimed at overseas markets. Some of the complaints run to as many as seventeen pages, but many are cast in formulaic terms over two or three manuscript sheets. The loss of most of the city's eighteenth-century tax records make it difficult to produce a comprehensive assessment of the litigants' social and economic status. But the patterns that do emerge from the aggregate glimpses of everyday practice give some sense of the city's distinctive credit market. Previous studies of neighbouring colonies have noted the increasing use of paper instruments and a shift to restrictive common law pleading in debt which, it is argued, provided creditors with greater commercial certainty and confidence and thereby nurtured the expansion of trade. However, in New York the complaints indicate that city traders retained a preference for dealing on account and presented their suits in the more flexible common law form of assumpsit, casting the city's economic and legal change in a different light. What we can glimpse of the practices and procedures associated with different forms of borrowing, indicate a local market that depended on inter-related household exchange and a commercial rationale that balanced considerations of profit with wider but cautiously-reckoned social obligations. For example, comparing the usual repayment terms available in the city with those offered wealthier borrowers, and the credit agreed between two upriver fur dealers and their Native American partners, reveals the city's credit market as a relatively conservative provider of support for residents and the able-bodied, thereby ensuring minimal public out-relief, which offered limited opportunities for investment and social mobility, even for those from within local circles. © 2012 by Koninklijke Brill N.V., Leiden, The Netherlands.","class; Colonial America; common law; credit; economy; New York City; social history; urban","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874869410"

Many analysts argue that North Korea is a unique political system. What kind of regime is the DPRK, and what kind of leader does it have? A variety of labels are given to the North Korean regime. These include likening the regime to an organized crime family and to a corporatist organism. There are certainly merits to each of these approaches, but each has its limitations. Pyongyang does share some of the attributes of organized crime and certainly engages in criminal activity in a systematic and calculating manner. This pattern of illicit behavior includes the production and distribution of narcotics as well as the counterfeiting of foreign currencies, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. But the DPRK is more than a crime family-it possesses a massive conventional military force as well as significant strategic forces. Moreover, the regime continues to brainwash, imprison, or starve North Koreans, inflicting untold misery and death on its people. Corporatism, meanwhile, may provide insights into certain aspects of the system, but its utility is limited by the confusion that surrounds understanding of this concept. Certainly North Korea is distinct politically, but it also has significant commonalities with various regime types and authority structures. Pyongyang is a highly centralized and militarized bureaucratic regime organized around an all-powerful leader. This monograph examines the leader and the system, and identifies the regime type. The author contends that the North Korean political system is best conceived as a totalitarian regime that, although weakened, remains remarkably resilient. After analyzing the key elements of totalitarianism, he argues that the system's greatest test will probably come after the death of Kim Jong Il. While the totalitarian regime may not long survive Kim's passing, one cannot assume that the system will collapse. Rather, the end of totalitarianism may simply mean that the DPRK will enter a new ""post-totalitarian"" phase similar to the paths taken by other communist systems such as the Soviet Union and China. While the latter term may be a good fit to describe China's political system in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, it seems inaccurate to describe North Korea. North Korea has not undergone any process of ""de- Kimification"": Kim Il Sung remains a deity in 21st century North Korea and criticism or reappraisal is unthinkable. Moreover, no one has contemplated criticizing or challenging his legacy because, by all accounts, he remains universally revered by DPRK citizens, including defectors. Furthermore, any official reevaluation of Kim Il Sung is extremely unlikely because the regime is currently led by Kim's son. The most accurate way to characterize North Korea today is as an eroding totalitarian regime. While totalitarianism is a powerful and intimidating system, it places tremendous strain on a state and a society-demanding constant activity and mobilization of personnel and exploitation of resources. The costs of maintaining heightened ideological indoctrination, an ever-vigilant coercive apparatus, and a large national defense organization are high and ultimately debilitating. To maintain this for decades results in fatigue and burnout. Eventually leaders and followers reach a point where both are physically and mentally exhausted, and the country's infrastructure and resources become devastated. North Korea's elite and ordinary people appear to be approaching this point. But this fatigue and burnout does not appear to produce much in the way of protest or dissent, let alone revolt; most likely the majority of people in North Korea are simply too tired to do much more than focus their time and energy on providing for the basic needs of their families. An absolute dictator still rules the regime. While the regime continues to hold a monopoly of the instruments of coercion, there has been some slippage or erosion in the defining features of totalitarianism. First of all, Kim Jong Il, although he is virtually an absolute dictator, appears to take into account the opinions of others the way his father did not. And ideology no longer appears to be so focused on transforming the state and society and more on the instrumental goals of economic recovery, development, and firming up regime power. While a condition of terror remains palpable, it is no longer all pervasive, and individuals are able to navigate or circumvent the system without fearing that they face dire consequences. As a result of the shift in ideology and alleviation of the climate of terror, the regime has become ""corrupted"" literally as bribery is rampant, and figuratively as the regime seeks to preserve its power and status. Meanwhile, the Stalinist centrally planned economy has been seriously eroded, and the monopoly of mass communication has loosened significantly. The regime has attempted to repair the latter two elements, but it is not clear to what extent this will be successful. The regime appears to be stable and not on the brink of collapse. While it is difficult to speculate about the longevity of North Korea as a political entity, it is more manageable to forecast the future of totalitarianism in the DPRK. Totalitarian regimes rarely endure longer than several decades and almost never survive the passing of the absolute dictator. In fact, Pyongyang is unique in that it is the only totalitarian regime to weather a leadership transition (from Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il). Indeed, North Korea is the world's ""longest lasting totalitarian regime, having spanned some 4 decades and surviving generational leadership succession."" Perhaps none of the numerous challenges the regime faces is more daunting than the succession question. Kim has probably at most 10-15 years in which to pave the way for one of his offspring to succeed him. If he lives long enough, it is possible he could be successful. What is less likely is that totalitarianism could survive another leadership transition. At some point, the totalitarian regime will simply collapse or weaken to the extent that it becomes a posttotalitarianism system. Possibly the clearest indication of the status and fate of Pyongyang's totalitarian regime over the next 10 years or so will come in how the arrangements for the succession to Kim Jong Il are handled. Is there evidence that a particular individual is being groomed to succeed Kim? The answer appears to be ""yes."" Some other key indicators to monitor are signs of dissent among elites and masses, especially fissures that might occur within the party or military. By carefully charting trends, observers can make it less likely that they will be caught off guard by the actions of North Korea's leader or changes in its political system. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The research was framed around five general sets of questions, to which we now return in this summary. The first issue was concerned with migration to (and population change in) Allentown. We illustrated that Allentown experienced a dramatic demographic shift between 1980 and 2000, and that the population of the city is now about 25 percent Latino (of which 67 percent is Puerto Rican). The growth of the Latino population is largely due to in-migration of Latinos from the New York City area and from other origins in the Northeast and overseas. Many Latinos stated that their reason for moving to Allentown was for job opportunities. Others had different reasons, such as marriage and family reasons, tranquility and safety, housing costs, and the ability to purchase a home. Second, we were concerned with questions of Latino settlement patterns in Allentown. We showed that Latinos are highly segregated from Anglos in the Allentown area. One way to understand the relatively high level of Latino-white segregation in the metro region is to examine Allentown in relation to Lehigh County. In 2000, approximately 82 percent of Lehigh County Latinos resided within the city of Allentown. In the same year, approximately 73 percent of all Latinos resided within 1.5 miles of its original settlement area, the intersection of Second and Linden Streets. We concluded that rather than social assimilation tied to spatial assimilation, by 2000 Latinos were merely replacing white, non-Hispanics in a more sequent occupance mode. The third issue that we explored in the Latinization of Allentown had to do with Anglo and Latino perceptions. Drawing on Stains (1994) work we demonstrated that Anglos were concerned with Latinos brandishing a ""Big Apple attitude"" and being indiscrete, boisterous, and loitering, as well as having an association with crime, gangs and drugs. There was a fear among some Anglos that the Latino influence was a threat to women and children. To gain some sense of Latino perceptions of Allentown, we conducted interviews and asked how fairly treated they felt in a number of different circumstances. The majority of our interviewees felt fairly treated by Anglos in the areas about which they were questioned. For example, 70 percent indicated that they received fair treatment by their Anglo neighbors. There are different experiences however, and some Latinos felt that many Anglos simply do not like Hispanic people and unfairly associate all Hispanics with crime and the drug culture of Allentown. The most common perception of Anglo treatment was related to social distance. Another area of concern in this chapter had to do with employment and fair treatment in the regional labor market. We found, from our interviews, that the place of employment was where Latinos felt the least fairly treated. Structural issues, such as spatial mismatch between residence and employment, the existence of a dual labor market, and unemployment, were also examined. U.S. Census data illustrated a spatial mismatch between Latinos' residential location and places of employment. The mismatch might be at least partly responsible for higher unemployment rates among Latinos. In addition, we found that a dual labor market exists in Allentown with Latinos (especially males) concentrated in secondary occupations. Finally, we illustrated with photographs that a Latino ethnoscape is becoming increasingly apparent in the city of Allentown. We concentrated on two major cultural identifiers, religion and food, to show how the cultural landscape of the city is changing. The religious landscape is being modified through the establishment of ""storefront"" churches and the language change from English to Spanish in formerly all-Anglo congregations. The grocery industry has changed in a variety of ways in Allentown. First, was the appearance of the Latino (Dominican) owned bodega. Second, Anglo-owned chain grocery stores began to offer produce and other items to cater to Latino tastes. The most recent change has been the opening of C-Town, a Latino (Dominican)-owned chain store based in New York City. In both cases, religion and food, Latinos have brought their culture with them to Allentown and it is becoming clearly imprinted on the landscape. Between 1980 and 2000, the Latino population of Allentown has quadrupled. Although the Puerto Rican population is the largest Latino group in the city, the Latino population is very diverse; there are substantial numbers of Mexicans and Dominicans living in Allentown. The rapid pace of the Latino influx would have strained the social fabric anywhere, but the strain has the potential to be particularly acute where it upsets the Germanic (Pennsylvania Dutch) sense of order in small cities like Allentown. Many questions arise concerning the link between these population shifts and what it means for the future of small cities. As cities continue to search for methods to deal with dwindling budgets and increased competition in attracting highly selective and mobile capital, the probability of growing urban isolation and inequality by racial and ethnic groups should undoubtedly be viewed as a social problem on the rise. © 2010 State University of New York.

It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers incentives to prevent crime.

Cellphone malware not only causes privacy leakage, extra charges, and depletion of battery power, but also generates malicious traffic and drains down mobile network and service capacity. In this work we devise a novel behavior-based malware detection system named pBMDS, which adopts a probabilistic approach through correlating user inputs with system calls to detect anomalous activities in cellphones. pBMDS observes unique behaviors of the mobile phone applications and the operating users on input and output constrained devices, and leverages a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to learn application and user behaviors from two major aspects: process state transitions and user operational patterns. Built on these, pBDMS identifies behavioral differences between malware and human users. Through extensive experiments on major smartphone platforms, we show that pBMDS can be easily deployed to existing smartphone hardware and it achieves high detection accuracy and low false positive rates in protecting major applications in smartphones.

It is constructed of a combination of three LFSRs (Linear Feedback Shift Registers) with irregular clocking manner. One of the most practical attacks against this algorithm is time-memory trade-off attack, which is based on birthday paradox. The goal of this attack is to find any intersection between precomputed LFSRs states set and set of states generating the output bits in the actual execution of the algorithm. In order to increase feasibility of this attack, the biased birthday attack was introduced. In this attack special states producing a specific pattern in output bits are sampled and only a fraction of the special states with higher probability of occurrence are stored. By using a 16-bit pattern of data there are 248 parallelizable preparation stages. This attack requires about 150 GB of memory and two minutes of conversation. Under these conditions, the probability of collision is about 0.61. In this paper an improvement in the collision probability is introduced without changing the available memory capacity and duration of conversation. Our approach is based on using multiple data patterns instead of using a single one. This approach leads to increment of the preprocessing and the collision probability. It is shown that there is a trade-off between the collision probability and the preprocessing complexity. © 2010 IEEE.","A5/1; Birthday paradox; Stream cipher; Time memory tradeoff attack","Algorithms; Cellular telephone systems; Cryptography; Global system for mobile communications; Hydraulics; Probability; Shift registers; Transport properties; Waveguide couplers; Bit patterns; Collision probability; Encryption algorithms; Irregular clocking; Linear feedback shift registers; Memory capacity; Multiple data; Output bits; Probability of occurrence; Stream Ciphers; Time-Memory Tradeoff attacks; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954429432"

Related to this concept is the extent to which people in an area, such as a neighborhood, have similar social characteristics. Such characteristics have tended to be empirically measured in terms of ethnicity or social class. This is largely because cities, predominantly in the US, have shown tendencies to separate social groups by income and race following riots in the late 1960s, social housing policies and suburbanization by higher-income groups. A key question, related to issues of segregation, is whether the spatial separation of social groups is a problem in its own right (wherein, living in a poor or socially homogeneous area may reinforce poor life chances) or whether these patterns are also symptomatic of deeper social problems and prejudices. Much of the research literature on segregation has assumed, in any case, that it forms a significant social and urban problem, but it has generally been difficult to identify commonly agreed-upon measures of its prevalence and impact. These various issues relate to a number of conceptual problems, as well as the availability of adequate data. In contemporary Western urban contexts, segregation has continued to be a prominent feature of city life which reflects, in part, not only the rising income inequalities but also a fear of crime and social difference. In countries such as the UK segregation has deepened around income, rather than ethnic, lines, while in the US it would seem that both income and ethnicity are important in explaining patterns of spatial clustering by particular social groups. An emerging research issue has been to acknowledge that patterns of residential segregation, essentially measures representations of social life contained in neighborhoods, may usefully be supplemented by an understanding of patterns of mobility and separation within and between areas. Thus, we now acknowledge dynamic forms of social separation wherein like-with-like social association may occur in social networks across space as well as within the neighborhood context. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Voters rely heavily on the information conveyed by campaigns in order to form judgments about who should govern. By most accounts, citizens in modern democracies know little about and feel distant from public affairs. Most people tune in during political campaigns, and what they see and hear can influence their opinions considerably, as shown by recent research on individual voting behavior (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Bartels 1993; Jacobson 1990; Johnston et al.1992; Popkin 1991; Zaller 1992) and on aggregate voting patterns (Bartels 1987; Brady and Johnston 1987; Jacobson 1980, 1990). It should, thus, be hard to anticipate the outcomes of elections without knowing how the media cover the elections, what themes the candidates stress, which candidates advertise the most, and what is said during conventions and debates. Election outcomes are strongly predicted, however, by forces outside of campaign politics. Evidence from an extensive literature on economics and elections shows that the governing party's reelection depends overwhelmingly on whether the country is prosperous at home and at peace abroad.1 Campaigns seem to be inessential to understanding who wins and who loses. The 1988 presidential election perhaps best exempliAes this puzzle. To many political scientists the 1988 presidential election represented an analytical triumph. George Bush won with nearly exactly the vote predicted by a simple model in which the vote is predicted by the percentage change in real personal disposable income.2 The lots of George Bush and Michael Dukakis, it seems, were drawn by the economic fates. But Bush did not win with ease. Throughout the campaign the polls Buctuated dramatically, suggesting that large fractions of the electorate made up their minds in the months, even days, leading up to Election Day (Gelman and King 1993). Michael Dukakis even held a substantial lead in the polls late in the summer of 1988. Observers of the campaigns argue that Dukakis was brought down not by the sudden realization of many voters that the economy was doing well but by the themes and strategies of the competing campaigns. The Republicans' messages of crime, patriotism, and conservatism resonated well with the public, while the Democratic campaign lost its focus after the primaries. Bush used attack advertisements and the free media with cunning and success, while Dukakis refused to slug back (Germond and Witcover 1989; Jamieson 1992). Such factors are nowhere to be found in the macropolitical models. Even still, those models worked smashingly well, though in the end they looked a lot like voodoo political economics. How is it that elections are highly predictable when voters rely heavily on what they see and hear in a particular campaign? The obvious, most common, and probably correct response is that the public discourse observed during campaigns confirms what most people privately believe about the state of the country and the political parties and candidates. Beginning with Paul Lazarsfeld's important studies of the elections of 1944 and 1948, social scientists have argued that campaigns reinforce the political orientations of voters and mobilize them to vote rather than convert large segments of the population to new ways of thinking or new patterns of behavior (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Key 1966; Campbell 1960). Recent social science research has further refined our understanding of reinforcement. The stylized facts that emerge from this research are that campaign communications are reinforcing for different groups within the electorate, depending on their partisan orientation and prior levels of information and interest (Zaller 1992). Partisans, especially low information partisans, seem to be particularly susceptible to messages from their own party's candidates. Partisans seem resistant to messages that are sponsored by the opposing party or that favor the opposing party. Nonpartisans seem to behave somewhat differently. Low information nonpartisans seem to tune out political messages of all sort, but the high information nonpartisans seem to be particularly influenced by political communications.3 But there is a fundamental problem with reinforcement arguments. People seem to throw away the public information that campaigns produce, or they use it inefficiently or not at all. Why would people use information this way? Do people just fool themselves? Two sorts of explanations of the reinforcing effects of campaigns are commonly expressed. First, political psychologists argue that these effects arise because people use cognitive shortcuts, such as priming, cognitive dissonance, and acceptability biases. As a result, individuals believe information that agrees with their beliefs and ignore information dissonant with their beliefs (Iyengar and Kinder 1987; Popkin 1991; Zaller 1992). By this account, elections are predictable because individuals hear what they want to hear, which is consistent with their private assessments of the economy. Second, political economists and many political scientists argue that people use their private information and discount publicly provided information, such as news and ads, because it is not as credible or as reliable as each individual's personal and private experiences (Downs 1957; Key 1966; Fiorina 1981). By this account elections are predictable because aggregate indicators of national well-being are the sum of many individual experiences, and the political campaigns matter little to those judgments. Each explanation has complementary strengths and weaknesses. Psychological accounts emphasize the importance of public information, such as ads and news, that all people see. These arguments arise out of attempts to understand the ups and downs that occur during elections, as many of the essays in this volume attest. Psychological explanations, though, have difficulty explaining the behavior of key groups within the electorate. In the advertising case, it is hard to think of a priming or framing story that explains the behavior of both partisans and independents and in particular why high information independents appear to move in the direction of the sponsor of the ads. Finally, these stories imply an eventual convergence of beliefs that is rarely observed. If all information were truly public and common, then over time we would observe complete consensus in public opinion on topics where all people agree about the objectives, such as greater economic growth or presidential job approval. Economic explanations emphasize private information and provide a coherent way to understand why people have different beliefs and preferences. Individuals' beliefs and preferences are rooted in their disparate experiences in the economy and with the government, parties, and specific politicians. However, such explanations discount the publicly conveyed information. This hardly seems consistent with the basic conjectures of rational choice, namely, that individuals make decisions in the most efficient (lowest cost) way or with empirical reality (Erikson et al. 2003). Economic man seems consistent with the observed predictability of elections but not with the variation that occurs during campaigns. This essay offers a simple theory of campaign information and learning that is entirely consistent with the basic observations made in empirical research. I build on the insights of political psychologists that campaigns fundamentally involve public information and of political economists that individuals' beliefs and preferences derive considerably from their private experiences and information. I assume that people use all information and that they value it equally. It is the mix of the public information from campaigns and the private information from personal experiences that creates the dynamics social scientists have observed. Private information generates heterogeneity in people's beliefs; public information creates coordinated shifts in those beliefs, which look identical to the patterns observed in survey data and experiments. The account offered here raises what I consider to be a very important set of methodological concerns in the study of campaigns. What is an adequate model of voter reasoning and behavior? The intellectual move made here is to introduce public as well as private information into a simple model of economic voting and to show that many of the basic individual level behavioral changes can be understood in these terms. © 2006 by University of Michigan Press.

As a side effect of managing routes, routing protocols to some extent also disseminate neighborship and topology information in the network, thereby disclosing at least some information on a node's own position to other nodes. Due to the wireless nature of ad hoc networks, this information can become available even to third parties which are not participating in the network. Using this information, location profiling may become possible, where attackers gather information on node positions or mobility patterns. This information may then be used for anything ranging from targeted advertisement to criminal activities. Therefore, location privacy is an important issue in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we analyze to what extent an attacker can track the precise location of a node, assuming a powerful attacker model where an attacker knows all neighbor relationships plus information on node distances. We present a new approach which uses these information and uses geometric constraints and heuristics to find node positions efficiently. The quality of our results is discussed and compared to other approaches. Based on the localization precision that such an ""omniscient"" attacker can reach, we will be able to evaluate the quality of future, more realistic attack models. © 2006 IEEE.","","Constraint theory; Network protocols; Network security; Precision engineering; Topology; Geometric constraints; Location tracking attack; Mobility patterns; Topology information; Ad hoc networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-39049140259"

Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as ""irrational"" and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders.

In this paper, we introduce a SNA method as a new approach to build an intrusion detection system (SN-IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks. The SN-IDS utilizes social relations as metrics-of-interest for anomaly detections, which is different from most traditional IDS approaches. The social system can capture and represent similar network statistics as those used in data mining based IDSs. To construct proper social networks, we first investigate ad hoc MAC and network layer data attributes and select relevant social feature sets; then we build up a set of socio-matrices based on these features. Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious activities and behaviors of mobile nodes. The detection results can be based on single or multi-relation rules. Finally, we analyze the performance of this SN-IDS under different simulated mobility conditions and traffic patterns. NS-2 simulation results show that this SN-IDS system can effectively detect common attacks with high detection rates and low false alarm rates. Furthermore, it has clear advantages over the conventional association rule based data mining IDS in terms of computation and system complexity. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Ad hoc networks; Intrusion detection system; Network security; Social network analysis","Ad hoc networks; Computer crime; Data mining; Information dissemination; Intrusion detection; Matrix algebra; Network layers; Network security; Social networking (online); Anomaly detection; High detection rate; Human interactions; Information propagation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Mathematical frameworks; Mobility conditions; Network statistics; Mobile ad hoc networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-74849136546"

The most relevant concepts related to possible deconcentration/displacement of problematic drug users are the nature of mobility and visibility of the users. A high level of mobility does not necessarily lead to more visibility and nuisance. Having a structured daily pattern (housing and/or working) largely determines visibility. More purposeful movement of drug users is associated with a lower level of visibility and nuisance. Mobility of users is strongly determined by the need to buy drugs.

The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-24144487089"

Previous studies have been directed toward understanding subgroups of homeless youth, such as injection drug users (IDUs) and young men who have sex with men (YMSM); yet limited research has focused on describing homeless travelers, a migratory subgroup of homeless youth who move from city to city. Based upon a larger three site study of young IDUs recruited in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York, a total of 133 travelers were identified. A subsample of 56 travelers participated in follow-up interviews, and provided data points for mapping. Travelers in all sites had extensive histories of criminal justice involvement and injection drug use. Four common traveling routes within and across the United States were identified. Reasons for traveling often related to drug use, money-making opportunities, and law enforcement. Risk-reduction services, such as shelters, syringe exchanges, or HIV/HCV testing, were used infrequently or occasionally. Mapping data documents the mobility of young IDUs across both urban and rural areas, which suggests that migration among IDUs across broad geographic regions may be a factor in the spread of blood-borne viruses. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61349100861"

Furthermore, the differences between feminine and masculine patterns of victimization by assault could not be interpreted only by the commonly used theory of the patriarchal family, and should be illuminated by recent changes in urban life, family patterns and in the construction of masculine identities and practices, as suggested by the theories of hyper masculinity or warrior ethos.

Understanding them seems likely to involve analyses and comparisons of whole societies. Using income inequality as an indicator and determinant of the scale of socioeconomic stratification in a society, we show that many problems associated with relative deprivation are more prevalent in more unequal societies. We summarise previously published evidence suggesting that this may be true of morbidity and mortality, obesity, teenage birth rates, mental illness, homicide, low trust, low social capital, hostility, and racism. To these we add new analyses which suggest that this is also true of poor educational performance among school children, the proportion of the population imprisoned, drug overdose mortality and low social mobility. That ill health and a wide range of other social problems associated with social status within societies are also more common in more unequal societies, may imply that income inequality is central to the creation of the apparently deep-seated social problems associated with poverty, relative deprivation or low social status. We suggest that the degree of material inequality in a society may not only be central to the social forces involved in national patterns of social stratification, but also that many of the problems related to low social status may be amenable to changes in income distribution. If the prevalence of these problems varies so much from society to society according to differences in income distribution, it suggests that the familiar social gradients in health and other outcomes are unlikely to result from social mobility sorting people merely by prior characteristics. Instead, the picture suggests that their frequency in a population is affected by the scale of social stratification that differs substantially from one society to another. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Far from being the case that ""'pluralization' of security largely ignores the weakest members"" of weak states (Goldsmith 2003:18), the evidence from Sierra Leone, as other African states, is that it provides almost all that the weakest members know of policing. What is particularly striking in Sierra Leone is the abundant evidence that youth were actually providing local security in areas where the SLP are rarely seen. So often demonised as bearing a large part of the blame for Sierra Leone's woes, and feared as 'the idle unemployed', they, in practice, are committed to playing a role in security and development. Surely one way of reducing the likelihood of a return to rebellion is to utilise their energies for the good of the community and to tell them of their worth. The fragmentation of policing calls for a policing policy quite distinct from the European pattern, where diversification is much less pronounced and resources for state policing are more considerable. To view plural policing as a potential solution to law and order issues does not mean a blanket acceptance of all providers. It is for elected government to construct a law and order policy that is based on incorporating all acceptable policing groups. Then the government has to define clearly the desired relationship between the various policing structures and set the parameters. The principle of a national strategy of law and order that integrates, regulates, mobilises, and empowers all those willing to preserve law and order in an acceptable manner is a fruitful place to start in improving the quality of security in Sierra Leone's communities. It could follow the concept adopted in South Africa regarding law and order issues as an entry-point to development projects: address law and order holistically as a development issue and not only as a policing issue. South Africa's Community Safety Forums bring together every local community organisation, international NGO and government agency concerned with improving the quality of life, to develop a community safety plan (Schärf 2000). This, rather than marginalising non-state policing, seems a better approach for Sierra Leone to follow. © 2005 Journal of Contemporary African Studies.","","Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Sierra Leone; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; World; law enforcement; legal rights; police force","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-27444438807"

However, existing approaches for prediction in spatio-temporal databases focus on either mining frequent sequential patterns at a certain geographical position, or constructing kinematical models to approximate real-world routes. The former overlooks the fact that movement patterns of objects are most likely to be local, and constrained in some certain region, while the later fails to take into consideration some important factors, e.g., population distribution, and the structure of traffic networks. To cope with those problems, we propose a general trajectory prediction algorithm called E3TP (an Effective, Efficient, and Easy Trajectory Prediction algorithm), which contains four main phases: (i) mining ″hotspot″ regions from moving objects databases; (ii) discovering frequent sequential routes in hotspot areas; (iii) computing the speed of a variety of moving objects; and (iv) predicting the dynamic motion behaviors of objects. Experimental results demonstrate that E3TP is an efficient and effective algorithm for trajectory prediction, and the prediction accuracy is about 30% higher than the naive approach. In addition, it is easy-to-use in realworld scenarios.","Criminal tracking analysis; Frequent sequential routes; Hotspot regions; Moving objects databases; Trajectory prediction","Law enforcement; Mining; Mobile devices; Routing algorithms; Trajectories; Wireless networks; Criminal tracking analysis; Frequent sequential routes; Hotspot regions; Moving objects databases; Trajectory prediction; Sequential switching","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649949160"

Crime rates are higher in more unequal cities; people in unequal cities are more likely to say that they are unhappy. There is a negative association between local inequality and the growth of city-level income and population, once we control for the initial distribution of skills. High levels of mobility across cities mean that city-level inequality should not be studied with the same analytical tools used to understand national inequality, and policy approaches need to reflect the urban context. Urban inequality reflects the choices of more and less skilled people to live together in particular areas. City-level skill inequality can explain about one-third of the variation in city-level income inequality, while skill inequality is itself explained by historical schooling patterns and immigration. Local income also reflects the substantial differences in the returns to skill across, which are related to local industrial patterns. © 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","crime; equity; immigration; income; urban area; urban population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350431266"

Research has found that victimization leads to increased risk of further victimization, especially in the short term; that ‘hot spots’ have a disproportionate number of repeat victims; and that repeat offences tend to be committed by prolific offenders. The development of successful crime reduction tactics and strategies also requires detailed attention to the mechanisms through which patterns are generated and may be disrupted, and the contexts relevant to differing mechanisms. Inattention to these is liable to lead to the implementation of ineffective measures or measures with counterproductive unintended consequences.

This chapter describes how two different units of time, one measured in years, the other in weeks, can be used to extract two different types of geographical patterns. One, the wave analysis, traces the actions of whole groups over a long time period. In particular, it should be of use in investigating the effect of in- or out-migration of racial/ethnic groups in neighborhoods in a metropolitan area and the effect that these population shifts have on crime. The particle analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the career trajectories of individuals, from an early age, as they experience noteworthy events during their lives and move (or are moved) from place to place in a city.

The present is compared to la violencia. In this era after the wide-ranging Peace Accords, the 36-year internal armed confl ict has become a touchstone for measuring and evaluating an ordinary sense of things. Dangers and uncertainties of a previous era, vividly remembered by many, are no longer an overwhelming presence in social experience. That particularly overriding and totalizing kind of violence is now, thankfully, said to be part of the past. Things have changed. The number of disappearances and deaths has decreased, massacres and wholesale destruction of villages has waned, the average income of Mayan peoples has risen, and average education levels have increased. But there is also deepening socioeconomic inequality brought on by uneven patterns of economic development. And lasting peace has proven elusive. Violence has become commonplace. On average, 250 people are murdered each month in the capital city alone (OCAVI 2007). Tabloid newspapers are canvassed with images of bullet-ridden cars and bloody corpses, tucked a few pages inside more respectable dailies. Violent crimes are rarely successfully prosecuted. Clandestine terror squads attack individuals in ways meant to look like common crime. The gang violence that now overwhelms the capital is creeping into more rural regions. While the army presumably hunts drug traffi ckers and cracks down on heinous crimes, political violence continues apace, as seen in the 1997 assassination of Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera and campaign-related killings in recent elections (Thomas and Benson 2008). There has also been a resurgence of right-wing political activity and a former dictator's return to power. Because all of this is not categorized as""war,""there is the sense that the""something better""promised for so long has been realized in the postwar period (Fischer and Benson 2006). In this chapter, we document how emerging forms of violence infl uence a sense of place and social engagements that defi ne everyday life in rural and urban Guatemala. Drawing on the medical anthropological concept of""social suffering,""we analyze a clustering of lived effects and delineate structural conditions that underpin disparate forms of violence (Bourdieu et al. 2000; Farmer 2004; Kleinman et al. 1997). This literature emphasizes the institutional and structural dimensions of suffering, including the role of markets and governments. Scholars have contextualized the origins of suffering and violence amidst sociopolitical and economic conditions and analyzed experiences of violence in the context of everyday attitudes. They have emphasized that in modern societies and capitalist economies suffering tends to adversely im-pact poor and marginalized groups because of the uneven distribution of material, social, and symbolic capital (Farmer 2003). Likewise, we emphasize the fundamental role of the aggressive program of liberal economic reform that arose alongside the Peace Accords (as outlined in this volume's introduction and other chapters) in fostering new forms of violence and vulnerability. While violence is most commonly explained in terms of individual actions (not just in Guatemala, but in other contexts dominated by a neoliberal zeitgeist, where gang members and other unsavory types are blamed for violence), we instead locate agency in structural conditions themselves, the very processes said to be Guatemala's path toward progress and lasting peace. The decentralization of markets and politics has involved an attendant""neoliberalization of violence,""the simultaneous dispersion of violence into everyday forms and the distribution of blame onto individuals, which defl ects attention away from systematically exerted aspects of violence. Violence ""not only traumatizes individuals,""Angelina Snodgrass Godoy writes about Guatemala's armed confl ict,""but in some cases may transform the social fabric of entire communities, thus explaining the persistence of its effects even in settings where all those who survived the initial violence have departed or died, or where new non-state forces predominate in decision making processes""(2002: 641). Like Godoy's concept of the""democratization of terror,""which emphasizes how new forms of violence and terror involve expanding segments of the population as either victims or perpetrators (or both), our view addresses the paradoxical way the outsourcing of violence away from a state monopoly contours civil society and political participation in such a way that actually fuels state power. By implicating neoliberal ideologies and policies in the production of the new violence, we complicate simple assessments of the Peace Accords' successes and failures and challenge the guiding premise that unfettered market forces are necessary for achieving peace and security. The ethnographic setting for our study is Tecpán, a town of about 10 thousand located 80 kilometers west of Guatemala City. Tecpán has a reputation in the region as a progressive and affl uent place. In the city proper, about 70 percent of the residents are Kaqchikel Mayas, although the Spanish-speaking, non-Indian, Ladino minority has historically exerted disproportionate control over local government and commercial institutions, buttressed by racist ideologies and colonial inequalities. But Tecpán is also home to an exceptionally strong indigenous bourgeois class that has long supported ethnic consciousness, the value of education, and economic experimentation. In the past few decades, this group became increasingly assertive in local and national politics (Fischer and Hendrickson 2002; Fischer 2001; Hendrickson 1995). Since the late 1990s, Tecpán has undergone major social transformations. There has been an infl ux of foreign popular culture fare along with various kinds of economic restructuring, including a shift away from traditional milpa agriculture and toward nontraditional export crops in the outlying rural hamlets and entrepreneurial activities in the town's regionally known apparel industry. In both industries, economic production is a powerful means of social and class mobility for Mayas. Entrepreneurial activity in Tecpán has partially been fostered by (or at least emerged within the context of ) the aggressive program of privatization and liberal economic reform and a new attitude toward Mayan peoples in the postwar period. Yet, opportunities for social mobility and economic advancement have gone hand in hand with the partial erosion of economic control and security for many people (C. Smith 1990c). International and national trade reforms entail signifi cant pressures related to market access and competition ( Fischer and Benson 2006; Fischer 2004; Goldín and Asturias de Barrios 2001; Goldín 1996; Thomas 2006). This context of shifting economic practices and mixed outcomes is one important part of the larger picture of insecurities and inequalities that shape contemporary forms of violence and how people think about and react to them. © 2009 by The University of Alabama Press.

The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective.

Understanding why the black-white test score gap narrowed over time, and why this progress stalled during the 1990s, is critical if we are to design policies capable of further reducing inequality in schooling outcomes in the United States. Given the widely documented association between educational outcomes and earnings, health and crime, successful efforts to further reduce the gap would undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for society as a whole. This chapter considers the role of school and neighborhood segregation in explaining trends in the black-white schooling gap. As we will discuss, provocative time-series and cross-sectional evidence points to strong associations between segregation and achievement gaps. The break in trend toward narrower test score gaps coincided with another toward greater school integration. Cross-sectionally, states with more segregated schools also tend to have wider gaps. It is not clear, however, whether causal interpretations should be attached to these correlations. Social science has struggled mightily to produce definitive proof that segregation and racial disparities are causally linked, and the available evidence-backed by eminently plausible theoretical arguments and proposed mechanisms-has influenced policy debates for decades. Key to the Supreme Court's transformational decision fifty years ago in Brown v. Board of Education is the assumption that racial segregation within the public schools contributes to black-white inequality in schooling outcomes. Attending a disproportionately minority school might affect both the motivation of students and their perceptions of the larger opportunity structure they face in society and their exposure to high-quality school resources or even the academic climate in the school. It is possible that the race-ethnicity of one's schoolmates might simply be a stand-in for their academic achievement level, which could affect the way or rate at which teachers present material or the productivity of student study groups, or as a stand-in for their socioeconomic status (SES). In fact, the influential report by James Coleman in the mid-1960s argued that a school's SES composition was at least as important in explaining inequality in student achievement as is school racial composition (Coleman et al. 1966). Understanding the distinct influences of school racial versus social class composition is relevant because some policies focused on reducing school racial segregation may not have very large impacts on school socioeconomic composition, and vice versa. Measures of school segregation by either race or social class could matter in largest part because they are proxies for the racial or class composition of the local neighborhood. Because most children attend local public schools, in national data there will be a great deal of cross-sectional correlation between school and neighborhood measures of race or SES segregation. The neighborhood social environment could matter above and beyond the composition of the local public school by shaping the youth social norms that help shape children's behavior, particularly given that so much socializing and exposure to local role models occur outside of school (Wilson 1987). Understanding the distinct influences of school versus neighborhood environments is important for policy because policies such as public or private school choice have the potential to change school but not neighborhood social compositions, and some housing mobility interventions might generate larger changes in neighborhood than school characteristics (see, for example, Sanbonmatsu et al. 2006). Figure 5.1 presents a basic conceptual framework outlining the potential causal mechanisms linking segregation to test score gaps. Neighborhood segregation could affect these outcomes directly or through its influence on school segregation. Direct links between neighborhood and test scores might be through neighborhood-level deviant peer influence, role model effects, or impacts on parental income derived from spatial mismatch-type effects. Direct links between school segregation and test scores could be mediated by differences in school input quality, or by peer influence operating at the school or classroom level. Thinking carefully about the particular mechanism through which social environment affects children is also important in understanding patterns in black-white student outcomes because different measures of segregation have been following different trajectories in recent years. Neighborhood racial and economic segregation actually declined during the 1990s, though these national trends mask important differences by region and so do not necessarily imply that neighborhood segregation is not relevant for understanding the slowdown in narrowing of the blackwhite test score gap (Glaeser and Vigdor 2003; Jargowsky 2003). Controversy continues about whether school segregation has increased or decreased over this same period. Increases reported in some studies (for example, Clotfelter 2004; Orfield and Eaton 1996) confound the increasing diversity of the student body in American public schools with increases in the separation of blacks from students of other races (Logan 2004). Measures more commonly accepted in the sociological and economic literature on segregation indicate very slight decreases in the degree of segregation over the past two decades. Regardless of measure, it is clear that school segregation has declined more slowly than neighborhood segregation over the same time period. The failure of school segregation to track neighborhood segregation reflects a broad decline in governmental efforts to integrate public schools (Orfield and Eaton 1996; Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2005). In our judgment, the evidence linking school segregation to student achievement is stronger than evidence supporting a direct causal role for neighborhood segregation. The current evidence implicating school race segregation certainly outweighs the available research on the effects of school segregation by social class, though the specific mechanisms through which racial composition affects student outcomes remain poorly understood. The best available evidence suggests that a 10 percent increase in the black share of a school's student body would reduce achievement test scores for black students by between 0.025 and around 0.08 standard deviations, and reduce test scores for whites by perhaps one-quarter to two-fifths as much. Thus, if school segregation had displayed a decrease in the 1990s commensurate with the observed decrease in neighborhood segregation, our best estimate is that the black-white test score gap would be roughly 0.01 to 0.02 standard deviation narrower.

By providing communication in the absence of a fixed infrastructure they are very attractive for many applications such as tactical and disaster recovery operations and virtual conferences. On the other hand, this flexibility introduces new security risks. Moreover, different characteristics of MANETs make conventional security systems ineffective and inefficient for this new environment. Intrusion detection, which is an indispensable part of a security system, presents also a particular challenge due to the dynamic nature of MANETs, the lack of central points, and their highly constrained nodes. In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of an artificial intelligence based learning technique to explore this difficult design space. The grammatical evolution technique inspired by natural evolution is explored to detect known attacks on MANETs such as DoS attacks and route disruption attacks. Intrusion detection programs are evolved for each attack and distributed to each node on the network. The performance of these programs is evaluated on different types of networks with different mobility and traffic patterns to show their effects on intrusion detection ability.

It has become a driving force for many new ideas and opportunities in design and implementation of modern large scale applications composed of highly autonomous entities. Recent efforts intended to integrate multi-agent, service-orients and P2P architectures aim to make these very promising opportunities happen. Indeed, in many cases multi-agent system (MAS) may be thought of as a set of autonomous entities, and, therefore, structuring the agents of MAS as a P2P network of nodes may result in architecture providing new dimension for design of open MAS composed of highly transient population of agents. Such architecture should potentially meet requirements to many modern, often critical, applications. An example of such applications of greatest concerns is remote sensing and information fusion for monitoring of large scale geospatial regions intended for detection and prediction of natural anomalies (tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.). Rapidly developing ad-hoc service-oriented networks of mobile devices, large scale embedded systems of various purposes (e.g. Smart Home applications), antiterrorist systems, etc. exemplify other applications where P2P service-oriented MAS may be highly effective. One of the key problem here is to provide seamless integration of the MAS technology and P2P networking supporting transparency of interaction of agents which know nothing about particular implementation of P2P networking, on the one hand, and, at the same time, know very few or nothing about existence and particular functionalities of most of or even all agents of MAS. In other words, ""transparency"" of agent interaction means that the agents have not to care how P2P networking is provided: they have to have an impression of direct interaction with the whole network of agents using semantic queries for services and/or, in their turn, providing the requested services in reply to semantic queries from the network. The talk presents the developed open P2P service-oriented MAS architecture and its software implementation demonstrated by several software prototypes of particular applications of various types solving prediction, classification, pattern recognition and control tasks in pure P2P style while having no centralized server managing either coordination of the distributed decision making procedure or routing the messages the agents exchange during interactions. The developed and implemented architecture consists of three vertically interacting overlay networks. The first of them is an overlay network of P2P providers (nodes of P2P communication network) set up on top of TCP/IP transport. Using P2P services via standard interfaces, applications may have available all functionalities and possibilities of P2P systems such as communication channels between peer devices, distributed search of peers and their services over network and so on. The second one corresponds to the distributed P2P agent platform instances intended for providing transparent interactions of applied agents of MAS. This overlay network set up on top of P2P communication network is able to manage agents. It realizes distributed Yellow and White pages and generic agent services implementing interaction with P2P agent platform. Each instance of agent platform is a component of distributed knowledge base representing distributed services and thus making it possible interaction of agents on semantic level. The third overlay network, which, in its turn, is set up on top of the network of P2P agent platform instances, is composed of applied agents which are interpreted as consumers and providers of the services specified in distributed Yellow pages. In distributed decision making systems, the agents may be consumers of information of particular data and information sources. It is important to note that the developed architecture and its software implementation is FIPA compatible. The particular case studies from various application domains developed as open P2P agentbased serviceoriented systems are used for explanation the basic ideas as well as for verification and validation of the basic research results. The set of case studies includes P2P intrusion detection system, P2P distributed ground object recognition system set up on board of unmanned aerial vehicles, P2P intelligent sensor network for prediction EI Nino ocean current and air traffic deconfliction system intended for use in emergent situation. © 2008 IEEE.","","Ad hoc networks; Agents; Architecture; Autonomous agents; Client server computer systems; Computer crime; Computer systems; Concurrency control; Data fusion; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Embedded systems; Feature extraction; Financial data processing; Flow interactions; Forecasting; Ground vehicles; Information theory; Integrated circuits; Intrusion detection; Knowledge based systems; Mobile devices; Multi agent systems; Object recognition; Ocean currents; Optical properties; Pattern recognition; Population statistics; Problem solving; Remote sensing; Semantics; Sensor data fusion; Sensor networks; Sensors; Software prototyping; Space optics; Standards; Telecommunication equipment; Telecommunication networks; Transparency; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Agent interactions; Agent plat form; Air Traffic; Application domains; Applications.; Autonomous entities; Basic research; Case studies; Centralized servers; Communication channels; Control tasks; Data and information; Direct interactions; Distributed decision-making; Distributed knowledge base; Distributed search; Distributed services; Distributed systems; Driving forces; Geo-spatial; Intelligent sensors; International symposium; Intrusion detection system; Large-scale applications; Large-scale embedded systems; MAS architecture; MAS technology; Multi agents; Multi-agent system; Network of agents; New ideas; Object recognition systems; Open MAS; Overlay Networks; P2P architectures; P2P communications; P2P networking; P2p networks; P2p systems; Peer-to-peer computing; Scientific computing; Seamless integration; Semantic levels; Semantic queries; Service-oriented; Service-oriented networks; Smart homes; Software implementations; Software prototypes; Standard interfaces; To many; Transient population; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Verification and validation; White pages; Yellow pages; Software agents","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-48049109010"

As a side effect of managing routes, routing protocols to some extent also disseminate neighborship and topology information in the network, thereby disclosing at least some information on a node's own position to other nodes. Due to the wireless nature of ad hoc networks, this information can become available even to third parties which are not participating in the network. Using this information, location profiling may become possible, where attackers gather information on node positions or mobility patterns. This information may then be used for anything ranging from targeted advertisement to criminal activities. Therefore, location privacy is an important issue in ad hoc networks. In this chapter, we first analyze to what extent an attacker can track the precise location of a node, assuming a powerful attacker model where an attacker knows all neighbor relationships plus information on node distances. We present a new approach which uses this information and uses geometric constraints and heuristics to find node positions efficiently. The quality of our results is discussed and compared to other approaches. In the second part of this chapter a more realistic scenario is analyzed where attackers try to abuse the DSR routing protocol, to obtain topology information and derive position estimations of other nodes from that. Therefore, we present a localization approach that is based on a ""hop to route length ratio"" heuristic and show how these results compare to our previous findings. As a result we conclude that the accuracy that can be gained by only using DSR protocol information is rather restricted and only poses a minimal privacy threat. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It concludes that the globalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between settings, with their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns of business, consumer and investment activities), the variable abilities of would-be perpetrators to recognize and act on those opportunities (the 'crime scripts' perspective), and their interactions with controls (including, but not restricted to, law enforcement).

However, modern creativity research claims that creativity is in the scope of learning and techniques for generating ideas are argued to give competitive advantage [1,2,6]. This may be an important message to designers, but also to the creative leaders. Even the most creative mind can commit the crime of repetition. This is because it is natural for the mind to create patterns [1]. Usually these patterns are helpful, but seeking new and innovative solutions as in product design, one should be able ""to think outside"" the common practices. Designers are required to be creative on demand, yet the procedures and methods for breaking the common approaches are often based on intuitive belief systems rather than on empirically validated theory [9]. One of the solutions to enhance creativity in game design is to use idea generation techniques that help designers to be creative on demand. Studies from other industries suggest that there is a strong relationship between the number of idea generation techniques and the number of successful products [8,10]. However, brainstorming, the best known technique, does not necessarily lead to innovation [5], which is also acknowledged in game design [3]. Even though brainstorming is useful in some cases, no single creativity technique can provide the ultimate solution for innovation in general: different techniques are needed [10]. Idea generation may seem a relatively easy task. However, while anybody can come up with some ideas, applicable and novel ideas do not come easily [9]. This is well established in those studies showing that one of the characteristics of companies successful in development is their ability to generate ideas [3]. In a successful ideating session, the generation of ideas is separated from idea evaluation and early criticism may be seen as harmful to the overall process[6]. Whereas vertical thinking targets the one and only solution, lateral thinking targets quantity [1] as a tool for quality [6]. Additionally, since idea generation is not a random process governed solely by an individual's personal traits, but a relatively structured process that can be explained [8], a methodological approach is indeed possible. Since we believe that game ideas have their special characteristics, and that and general idea generation techniques may not be so very supportive of the nature of game design processes, we designed several experimental game-specific techniques in the GameSpace project (http://gamelab.uta.fi/GameSpace). These techniques are based on game-related stimuli and structural modules for ideating casual, multiplayer and mobile games. During the project, computer programs and other tools were created to help documenting, game analysis, randomization of stimuli and communicative aspects. These techniques are easy to approach from their functional aspects: the activity of idea generation is based on playing specific board games, card games, using small computer applications or other tools and toys. In light of our workshop experiences with Finnish game professionals in 2006 and 2007, these idea generation techniques can be successfully utilized and help designers to create applicable and novel game ideas that they would not otherwise come up with. Hence these techniques can be seen as a successful way to help ""creativity on demand"" in game design practices. Some of these techniques have already been fruitfully adopted by the Finnish mobile game industry. While we have already documented several positive user experiences and know that our techniques work, we are conducting a more extensive user study in autumn 2007 and spring 2008 to gain a systematic understanding of game specific idea generation techniques and game idea generation processes.

This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior. © 2007 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Aggression; Alcohol; Attention; Crime; Emotion regulation; Glucose; Impulsivity; Self-control; Self-regulation; Stress","Blood Glucose; Humans; Self Efficacy; Volition; cognition; glucose blood level; human; review; self concept","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-40249094776"

This 'opposite', or negative, space comprises the spatially withdrawn and socially excluded who are largely outside the purview of the comfortable classes of the same cities. Not only has residential segregation been sustained over recent decades, so too have mobile circuits of mutual exclusion been created, which enable higher-income groups to avoid the associated negative externalities of poverty (visibility, disorder, aggression and so on). As responsibility for dealing with social risks has become devolved to the level of the household, the desire for social evasion, as politicians, media systems and welfare patterns mark out threatening territories, has become more evident. The counterpart city is shunned in ever more elaborate ways and with the support of public policies. As the 'spatial' social policies, housing and urban, have become increasingly criminalized in the focus of their agendas, such interventions expend energy to facilitate this separation between affluent and poor. Traditional imperatives for public intervention are diminished as poverty has become more concealed from affluence - its costs and impacts evaded by technologies, socio-spatial circuits and policies that skirt those who are locked into places of poverty and abject marginality, a constellation of social forces and effects I term the great cut. © 2008 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Counterpart city; Social exclusion; Urban social life","policy making; poverty; social exclusion; social segregation; urban area; urban society","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-54249094188"

In this paper, we analyze a wireless location privacy protection system (WLP2S), and generalize it to a MIX based formal model, which includes a MIX, a set of MIX's user, and a intruder of MIX. In addition, we also use information theory approach to define anonymity and measures of this model, and describe the characteristics of observation process in WLP2S in detail. Two benefits arise from our model. Firstly, it provides a means of evaluating the privacy level of proposed location privacy protection protocols. We use the measures of proposed formal model to study the performance of our novel silent period technique. Simulation results reveal the role of many parameters-such as users' mobility pattern and intruders' tracking accuracy- on users' privacy level. The results shed more light on improving our defense protocol. Secondly, our approach provides a link between existing defense and attack protocols in MIX research and the new location privacy protection problem. By utilizing the formal model, we conducted preliminary studies in identifying potential attacks, and improve the performance of existing defense protocol. This study results an extension of existing defense protocols.

Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out.

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, ""Denial of Service""(DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach ""Cross Layer Based Intrusion Detection System""(CEDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

A 1997 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of incarcerated offenders found that 57% of state inmates and 45% of federal inmates reported drug use in the month prior to their offense. These rates are increases of 14% and 40%, respectively, over 1991 levels (Mumola, 1999). During the same period drug use among the general U.S. population was declining or holding steady (SAMHSA, 1998). Moreover, many of these drug using offenders are serious substance abusers, not casual users. Peters and his colleagues (1998), for example, reported that 56% of a sample of Texas inmates were diagnosed as having a substance abuse or dependence disorder during the 30 days prior to their incarceration. Similarly, a survey of jail inmates in Ohio found that 51% were currently drug dependent (Lo and Stephens, 2000). In all, a large body of accumulated evidence points to the substantial treatment need for a considerable proportion of offenders under criminal justice supervision (Belenko et al., 1998; Lo and Stephens, 2000). In fact, it is estimated that about 40% of all Americans who clearly need drug treatment are under the supervision of the criminal justice system (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990:7). Without effective substance abuse treatment, a high-proportion of these incarcerated offenders will resume their patterns of illicit drug use, and in all likelihood their patterns of criminal offending, once released from prison. As such, the period of time when an offender is incarcerated represents a crucial opportunity to prevent crime by intervening in this cycle of drug abuse and crime. Several aspects of correctional facilities (i.e., prisons, jails) make incarceration-based substance abuse treatment attractive. Perhaps most importantly, these facilities have the capacity to mobilize considerable coercive force to encourage substance abusing offenders to engage in treatment; many of whom otherwise would not do so. Additionally, the reduced availability of illicit substances facilitates detoxification and the isolated environments of many of these programs allow participants to focus on their substance abuse problems, in an environment typically more safe and clean than the environment in the general population. While the potential of incarceration-based drug treatment programs is clear, their effectiveness is much less so. Many evaluations of these programs have been conducted; however, methodological shortcomings prevalent in this body of research make it difficult to determine whether the observed effects are actually due to the program, or to methodological flaws in the evaluation. This chapter reviews this body of research utilizing meta-analytic techniques in an attempt to determine whether participation in these programs is associated with reduced drug use and other criminal behavior. More specifically, this systematic review focuses on addressing the following research questions: Are incarceration-based drug treatment programs effective in reducing recidivism and drug use? Approximately how effective are these programs? Is the estimated magnitude of a program?s effect associated with attributes of the research method, research sample, or intervention? Are there particular types of drug treatment that are especially effective or ineffective? © 2006 Springer.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750600104"

At the very least, these laws require local law enforcement officials to publicize the personal and residential information of known sex offenders. Although researchers and other social commentators have begun to assess the effects of community notification on targeted sex offenders and on criminal justice practices and practitioners, the potential consequences of the policy for different types of communities have received only scant attention. Using sex offender registry and US Census data for two states (Nebraska and Oklahoma), we examine the relationship between community characteristics and the residential patterns of sex offenders. Findings from mapping and regression analyses suggest a greater concentration of sex offenders in disadvantaged communities than in more affluent communities. To the extent that community notification allows residents of more affluent communities to mobilize resources in order to remove identified sex offenders, it may increase the geographical clustering of these offenders in areas already facing a greater risk and having fewer resources to manage the problem. Implications of findings in terms of ""concentrated disadvantage"" are discussed. © 2008 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.","Community notification; Neighborhoods; Sex offender; Stratification","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-49549108503"

Patterns of crime are generally explained in terms of the routine activities of the offender. His or her travel to crime distances are short and crimes are committed within the offender's ‘awareness space’. It has generally been theorised that victims also have short journeys to crime, associated with their routine behaviour. This review, however, suggests that occupancy of ‘unawareness space’, where people are away from familiar surroundings, may confer heightened risk. This is supported in research in the special case of crime and tourism, though other travelling victim patterns have been largely ignored. This paper postulates that crime risk increases at the intersection of offender awareness and victim unawareness spaces. The 2002–3 British Crime Survey provides some suggestive evidence on this. Its analysis reveals that 26.9% of self-reported victimisation occurs more than 15 minutes away from the victim's home. For personal theft crimes over 70% of the victims were outside their immediate locality, suggesting a stronger link between victim mobility and certain types of offence.

A new high density microcode (DataGrid), combined with colour for contrast preservation, is used as a raster pattern for the macro cells of standard Data Matrix codes. As the symbols of the DataGrid microcode are optimized for the usage in security applications, when printed on a substrate, a stochastic error signal (EpiCode) occurs. The EpiCode is a result of the random structure of the substrate surface and the microscopic imperfections of the marking process. In contrast to most security printing solutions, an explicit individualisation of the product packaging is not needed, which makes the technique applicable even if using offset printing. The observations on experimental data, indicate that the implementation of colour DataGrid into Data Matrix code: i) does not disturb the decoding algorithms of standard mobile tagging applications and ii) the authentication signal (EpiCode) has enough discriminatory information to correctly identify an original out of over 10,000,000,000 samples. The presented concept could be used as an anti-counterfeiting tool, as the mobile tags are soon to become an inseparable part of most consumer goods packages.","Anti-counterfeiting; Colour; Data Matrix; Mobile tagging; Security","Bar codes; Chip scale packages; Color; Crime; Lithography; Marking machines; Printing; Surface structure; Anti-counterfeiting; Colour; Data matrices; Mobile tagging; Security; Matrix algebra","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78149396995"

The sensor consist of a digital projection unit and two cameras in a stereo arrangement, whereby both are battery powered. The data transfer to a base station will be done via WLAN. This gives the possibility to use the system in complicate, remote measurement situations, which are typical in archaeology and architecture. In the measurement procedure the sensor will be hand-held by the user, illuminating the object with a sequence of less than 10 fringe patterns, within a time below 200 ms. This short sequence duration was achieved by a new approach, which combines the epipolar constraint with robust phase correlation utilizing a pre-calibrated sensor head, containing two cameras and a digital fringe projector. Furthermore, the system can be utilized to acquire the all around shape of objects by using the phasogrammetric approach with virtual land marks introduced by the authors1,2. This way no matching procedures or markers are necessary for the registration of multiple views, which makes the system very flexible in accomplishing different measurement tasks. The realized measurement field is approx. 100 mm up to 400 mm in diameter. The mobile character makes the measurement system useful for a wide range of applications in arts, architecture, archaeology and criminology, which will be shown in the paper.","Epipolar linie; Fringe projection; Mobile system; Self calibration; Whole body measurement","Architecture; Cameras; Data transfer; Mobile devices; Robust control; Telemetering; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Epipolar linie; Fringe projection; Self calibration; Whole body measurement; Optical sensors","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36248977080"

These nodes often operate in a physically insecure environment and, as a result, are vulnerable to capture and compromise. In addition, the nature of the wireless communication medium restricts enforcement of rigourous node memberships and so a number of malicious nodes may also participate in the network. These nodes, in order to snoop or sabotage, can undertake a variety of attacks against the network. Among these, wormhole attacks have unusual significance primarily due to their modus operandi and peculiar attack pattern. In such attacks, two or more malicious colluding nodes create a higher level virtual tunnel in the network, which is employed to transport packets between the tunnel endpoints. These tunnels emulate shorter links in the network and so act as bait to unsuspecting network nodes which, by default, seek shorter routes. The benefit gained by the malicious nodes is that they are able to conduct a variety of attacks against the tunnelled traffic. In this paper, we present a novel trust-based scheme for identifying and isolating nodes that create a wormhole in the network, without engaging any cryptographic means. With the help of extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our scheme functions effectively in the presence of malicious colluding nodes and does not impose any unnecessary conditions upon the network establishment and operation phase.","Ad-hoc; Attacks; Network; Routing protocol; Security; Trust","Computer simulation; Networks (circuits); Routing protocols; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad-hoc; Attacks; Extensive simulations; Malicious nodes; Mobile ad hoc wireless networks; Security; Trust; Wireless communications; Computer crime","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-37349060385"

The multi-agent system is implemented as a Windows desktop program and then loosely coupled with ESRI ArcGIS. The model allows users to create artificial societies which consist of offender agents, target agents, and crime places for crime pattern simulation purposes.

Many partition prevention approaches are only based on link availability while ignoring that nodes mostly move in a group pattern in practical environment. Adversaries may decrease network performance through deliberately launching partition, which is seldom considered as a type of attack in conventional intrusion detection systems and secure routing protocols. To prevent both natural and malicious network partition caused by group mobility, we present a novel route maintaining mechanism based on Cooperative Healing Cell, which is composed by cooperative groups of nodes. The basic unit for route maintenance is node group not a single node. Our design employs a preemptive partition avoidance policy which can launch route maintenance before actual partition. The simulation shows that cooperative healing cell not only increases the precision in partition prediction but also provides an effective cooperation enhancement against the partition caused by malicious node groups. ©2008 IEEE.","Ad hoc; Cell; Cooperative; Mobility; Partition","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Launching; Maintainability; Maintenance; Partitions (building); Routing protocols; Sensors; Systems engineering; Telecommunication; Weight control; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc; Cell; Cooperative; Cooperative groups; Group mobility; International conferences; Intrusion Detection Systems; Link availability; Malicious nodes; Mobility; Network partitioning; Network performances; Novel route; Partition; Route maintenance; Secure routing protocols; Ad hoc networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50249164865"

Accordingly, police departments, military organizations, and intelligence agencies seek to learn these preferences and identify locations with a high probability of experiencing the particular event of interest in the near future. Often, such agencies are keen not just to predict the spatial pattern of future events but even more importantly to conduct threat assessments of particular criminal gangs or insurgent groups. These threat assessments include identifying where each of the various groups presents the greatest threat to the community, what the most likely targets are for each criminal group, what makes one location more likely to experience an attack than another, and how to most efficiently allocate resources to address the specific threats to the community. Previous research has demonstrated that applying multivariate prediction models to relate features in an area to the occurrence of crimes offers an improvement in predictive performance over traditional methods of hot-spot analysis. This paper introduces the application of multilevel modeling to these multivariate spatial choice models, demonstrating that it is possible to significantly improve the predictive performance of the spatial choice models for individual groups and leverage that information to provide improved threat assessments of the criminal elements in a given geographic area. © 2009 IEEE.","Crime analysis; Multilevel modeling; Predictive analysis; Spatial data","Data handling; Location; Mathematical models; Predictive control systems; Probability density function; Choice model; Geographic areas; High probability; Hot spot; Insurgent groups; Intelligence agencies; Military organizations; Multilevel modeling; Prediction model; Predictive analysis; Predictive performance; Spatial data; Spatial patterns; Threat assessment; Crime","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955091584"

(3) What victim and suspect characteristics significantly predict the distance traveled from the residence to the incident location?

The truth, however, is that local communities have a long history of ambivalence toward new arrivals and minorities. Persistent patterns of segregation by race and income still exist in housing and schools, along with a growing emphasis on rapid metropolitan development (sprawl) that encourages upwardly mobile families to abandon older communities and their problems. This dual pattern is becoming increasingly important as America grows more diverse than ever and economic inequality increases. Two recent trends compel new attention to these issues. First, the geography of race and class represents a crucial litmus test for the new ""regionalism""-the political movement to address the linked fortunes of cities and suburbs. Second, housing has all but disappeared as a major social policy issue over the past two decades. This timely book shows how unequal housing choices and sprawling development create an unequal geography of opportunity. It emerges from a project sponsored by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University in collaboration with the Joint Center for Housing Studies and the Brookings Institution. The contributors-policy analysts, political observers, social scientists, and urban planners-document key patterns, their consequences, and how we can respond, taking a hard look at both successes and failures of the past. Place still matters, perhaps more than ever. High levels of segregation shape education and job opportunity, crime and insecurity, and long-term economic prospects. These problems cannot be addressed effectively if society assumes that segregation will take care of itself. © 2005 The Brookings Institution.

Secondly, a comparison of qualitative and quantitative findings will be conducted: qualitative analyses indicate that the results of quantitative rating scales on the perception, evaluation and acceptance of technical and environmental hazards might be misleading since the public's focus on risks as elicited by open association stimuli relies much more on 'everyday-life' and 'pervasive' risks than for instance on hazards emerging from new technologies.

On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge.

Among the network exploits, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a large-scale, coordinated attack on the availability of services of a victim system, launched indirectly through many compromised computers on the Internet. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are network security tools that process local audit data or monitor network traffic to search for specific patterns or certain deviations from expected behavior which indicate malicious activities against the protected network. In our study, we proposed and tested four different distributed intrusion detection methods to detect DDoS attacks in the MIT DARPA LLDOS 1.0 dataset. Currently, all of our methods use the alarms generated by Snort, a signature-based network IDS. We used mobile agents in three of the methods on the Jade (Java Agent Development Framework) platform in order to reduce network bandwidth usage by moving data analysis computations to the location of the intrusion data. Based on reliability, network load and mean detection time values of each, one of the methods is shown to be better than the others. © 2008 IEEE.","DARPA dataset; DDoS; Distributed intrusion detection; Intrusion detection; Jade: Java Agent Development Framework; Mobile agents","Agents; Computational methods; Computer applications; Computer crime; Distributed computer systems; Information science; Internet; Mobile agents; Network security; Security of data; Silicate minerals; Telecommunication traffic; Wireless networks; DARPA dataset; Data analysis; DDoS; Detection time; Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS); Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks; Distributed intrusion detection; Intrusion detection methods; Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs); Jade: Java Agent Development Framework; Network bandwidths; Network loads; Network technologies; Network traffics; Security problems; Security tools; Sensitive informations; Intrusion detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58449103863"

Working closely with the Forensic Science Service (FSS), EPSRC hopes to shift the use of forensics from simply providing evidence for a prosecution towards actively helping during an investigation. One step was to introduce the Forensic Response Vehicle, a van fitted out with analysis equipment that can be driven to a crime scene. Equipment in the van can be used to take fingerprints, analyze DNA samples and download data from mobile phones. With this, scientists can turn around DNA samples much quicker than traditional procedures. A novel profiling technique is also under development at the University of Hull. Using a miniature chemical analyzer based on microfluidics, DNA fingerprint can, in principle, be generated in minutes.","Biomedical measurement; Criminal law; Police; Portable instruments","Anthropometry; Biomechanics; DNA; Fluidics; Pattern recognition; Portable equipment; Biomedical measurement; Criminal investigations; Criminal law; Mobile crime laboratories; Law enforcement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646891048"

In this research, we show the restriction of the present intrusion detection system architecture and propose the new architecture that can handle the attack via the network and survive from it, using the mobile agent technology with the network topology design that hides the main resource of the network behind the intrusion detection system which separates network resource into segments and installs the monitored host onto each of network segment for robustness from all pattern of the attacking.

Static analysis provides techniques that can help with such problems; however, there are several obstacles that must be overcome: For many kinds of potentially malicious programs, symbol-table and debugging information is entirely absent. Even if it is present, it cannot be relied upon. To understand memory-access operations, it is necessary to determine the set of addresses accessed by each operation. This is difficult because While some memory operations use explicit memory addresses in the instruction (easy), others use indirect addressing via address expressions (difficult). Arithmetic on addresses is pervasive. For instance, even when the value of a local variable is loaded from its slot in an activation record, address arithmetic is performed. There is no notion of type at the hardware level, so address values cannot be distinguished from integer values. Memory accesses do not have to be aligned, so word-sized address values could potentially be cobbled together from misaligned reads and writes. We have developed static-analysis algorithms to recover information about the contents of memory locations and how they are manipulated by an executable. By combining these analyses with facilities provided by the IDAPro and CodeSurfer toolkits, we have created CodeSurfer/x86, a prototype tool for browsing, inspecting, and analyzing x86 executables. From an x86 executable, CodeSurfer/x86 recovers intermediate representations that are similar to what would be created by a compiler for a program written in a high-level language. CodeSurfer/x86 also supports a scripting language, as well as several kinds of sophisticated pattern-matching capabilities. These facilities provide a platform for the development of additional tools for analyzing the security properties of executables. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.","","Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Data storage equipment; Mobile computing; Program debugging; Software prototyping; CodeSurfer toolkits; Malicious programs; Memory accesses; Memory operations; Supervisory and executive programs","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646722153"

In this paper, we present an analytical model for estimating the evolution of infections spanning multiple network domains that host mobile nodes. We validate the accuracy of the proposed model by comparing its predictions to simulations driven by realistic mobility patterns. Our results show that such a mobile infection requires less than a day to infect the majority of a mobile population with thousands of wireless nodes spanning hundreds of network domains. Moreover, if mobile nodes are allowed to infect nodes within the same domain that are connected to the wired network, then an even smaller number of mobile nodes can inflict comparable damage in similar time frames. Unfortunately, these infections generate negligible activity at global malware monitoring stations (e.g., network telescopes and honeypots), which contributes to their stealthiness. By observing the infection's spatial evolution we show that popular domains are infected during the early stages of the infection. This observation is likely to be useful in designing counterineasures against mobile infections. By placing monitors in approximately 10% of the most visited domains, we can detect the mobile worm before it reaches a majority of the population. Finally, we elucidate why simply placing telescopes In just the popular domains is not sufficient for early detection.","","Ad hoc networks; Computer crime; Imaging techniques; Internet protocols; Optical instruments; Optical telescopes; Optimization; Photography; Population statistics; Telescopes; Analytical modelling; Early detection; Early stages; Honeypots; International symposium; Malware; Mobile nodes; Mobility patterns; Monitoring stations; Network domains; Network telescopes; Spatial evolution; Time frames; Wired networks; Wireless nodes; Wireless networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-49649085629"

In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61849169600"

For three different woven fabrics and a stitch-bonded non-crimp fabric, it was found that in general the higher Rp/a0, the lower is σα, with an approximately linear relation between Rp/a0 and σα. Woven fabrics show mainly macro-scale non-uniformities determined by the fibre tow mobility, which is limited by the void space between the tows. The mainly mesoscopic non-uniformities in non-crimp fabrics are imposed by the stitching pattern, which again determines the values of Rp/a0 and σα. The principal values and the orientation of the principal axes for the global in-plane permeabilities were determined based on series of experiments that were evaluated statistically. All relative variations (standard deviations/mean values) of the principal permeability values were found to be in the range between 9.1% and 29.3%. The variation in the angle describing the orientation of the principal permeability axes increases with increasing relative permeability variations. Analysis of the relation between permeability variations and geometrical fabric parameters suggests that the more homogeneous the fibre-void distribution in the fabric, i.e., the higher Rp/a0 and the lower σα, respectively, the lower the local permeability variations and the more similar the flow front shape to a perfect ellipse. The global permeability variations, on the other hand, increase with the local variations until they reach a maximum and then decrease again. Quantitative comparison of measured permeability variations and the results of stochastic simulations indicates that, while the results are in the same order of magnitude, the stochastic model is not detailed enough for quantitatively accurate prediction of permeability variations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This contrasts with more mixed diets reflected in skeletons from Matjes River Rock Shelter, only 14 km along the shore. Assuming that the burials represent the populations that inhabited the sites, such clear economic separation could have come about only if these were two separate groups of people who lived in clearly demarcated, mutually exclusive territories.

Related to this concept is the extent to which people in an area, such as a neighborhood, have similar social characteristics. Such characteristics have tended to be empirically measured in terms of ethnicity or social class. This is largely because cities, predominantly in the US, have shown tendencies to separate social groups by income and race following riots in the late 1960s, social housing policies and suburbanization by higher-income groups. A key question, related to issues of segregation, is whether the spatial separation of social groups is a problem in its own right (wherein, living in a poor or socially homogeneous area may reinforce poor life chances) or whether these patterns are also symptomatic of deeper social problems and prejudices. Much of the research literature on segregation has assumed, in any case, that it forms a significant social and urban problem, but it has generally been difficult to identify commonly agreed-upon measures of its prevalence and impact. These various issues relate to a number of conceptual problems, as well as the availability of adequate data. In contemporary Western urban contexts, segregation has continued to be a prominent feature of city life which reflects, in part, not only the rising income inequalities but also a fear of crime and social difference. In countries such as the UK segregation has deepened around income, rather than ethnic, lines, while in the US it would seem that both income and ethnicity are important in explaining patterns of spatial clustering by particular social groups. An emerging research issue has been to acknowledge that patterns of residential segregation, essentially measures representations of social life contained in neighborhoods, may usefully be supplemented by an understanding of patterns of mobility and separation within and between areas.

Stalking represents a complex behavioural pattern, which includes harassment, the invasion of a person's privacy and often the use of violence. Methods: The present review assembles findings from 13 years of research. Results: In German-speaking regions the risk of being a victim of stalking during one's lifetime is 17% for women and 4% for men. The majority of offenders are men and the majority of victims are women. The prevalence of violent acts in stalking is found to be between 21 and 76% depending on the examined population and the definition of stalking and violence. The highest prevalence of violence is found in ex-partner stalking which presents the most dangerous form of stalking and is found to include some form of violence in 51-89% of cases. Other predictors of violent behaviour in stalking are verbal threats, especially if they are repeated. Also predictive of violence in stalking are personality disorders, especially if no major mental health disorder was present (such as schizophrenia or affective disorders). The prevalence of serious violence in stalking is probably underestimated because such cases are usually not registered as cases of stalking in police files. Studies of murder victims showed a high prevalence of stalking previous to the offence, which leads to the conclusion that stalking is a serious predictor of homicide. Predictors of serious violence in stalking are not the same as the ones of ""average"" violence in stalking. They also differ from the predictors usually employed in risk assessments. Predictors for serious violence in stalking are the length of stalking and having ambushed the victim at home. Different typologies are suggested which focus on such factors as type of relationship between stalker and victim, motive, psychopathology and risk profile of the stalker. Conclusion: Stalking represents a complex obsessive and persistent behavioural pattern which often aims at causing alarm and distress in the victim. New communication technologies such as mobile phones, text messaging and e-mails represent new and easier ways to stalk a person. Stalking happens frequently and results frequently in violent acts toward the victim. Especially ex-partner stalking includes more often than not some form of violence. However, there are currently no evidence-based recommendations on how to adequately assess the risk a stalker poses.","Relationship violence; Stalking; Threat; Violence; Violent behaviour","hazard; homicide; human; human relation; mood disorder; motivation; offender; personality disorder; prevalence; review; risk assessment; schizophrenia; sex difference; stalking; threat; victim; violence","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-44949090390"

As network speeds and detection workloads increase, it is important for NIDSes to be highly efficient. Most NIDSes need to check for thousands of known attack patterns in every packet, making pattern matching the most expensive part of signature-based NIDSes in terms of processing and memory resources. This paper describes Piranha, a new algorithm for pattern matching tailored specifically for intrusion detection. Piranha is based on the observation that if the rarest substring of a pattern does not appear, then the whole pattern will definitely not match. Our experimental results, based on traces that represent typical NIDS workloads, indicate that Piranha can enhance the performance of a NIDS by 11% to 28% in terms of processing time and by 18% to 73% in terms of memory usage compared to existing NIDS pattern matching algorithms.

In this model, every immune agent owns a small detector set which represents its detection function. After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets. This paper focuses on the immune agents' initialization, detection, evolution and update strategies. The immune agents are abstract and their detailed implementations are not taken into account in this paper.

Therefore, in our research - based on the autonomous and mobile agent as well as the intrusion detection system - we decided, in the first place, to build a mobile agent pattern in order to provide a clean and easy way to develop an agent based application; mainly in an open and on a large scale distributed environment, such as Internet and application areas and E-commerce, as well. In our study, we chose Java Technology for the implementation because it is more suitable, secure OS independent for the development of such kind of code; it contains also a security manager mechanism that is customizable by a host accepting a mobile agent. Thus, any attack or evasion method will not perturb the behaviour of the host. In short, the host will be safer. Besides, we used JINI (Java Intelligent Network Interface) as a usable API dedicated to a user protocol.","Design pattern; Jini and simulation; Mobile agent","Computer crime; Data processing; Java programming language; Modal analysis; Agent-based applications; Application area; Design Patterns; Distributed environments; Intrusion Detection Systems; Java technologies; Jini and simulation; System administration; Mobile agents","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898447941"

The potential exists for worms to be opportunistically transmitted between devices as they move around, so human mobility patterns will have an impact on epidemic spread. The scenario we address in this paper is proximity attacks from fleetingly in-contact wireless devices with short-range communication range, such as Bluetooth-enabled smart phones. An individual-based model of mobile devices is introduced and the effect of population characteristics and device behaviour on the outbreak dynamics is investigated. The model uses straight-line motion to achieve population, though it is recognised that this is a highly simplified representation of human mobility patterns. We show that the contact rate can be derived from the underlying mobility model and, through extensive simulation, that mass-action epidemic models remain applicable to worm spreading in the low density regime studied here. The model gives useful analytical expressions against which more refined simulations of worm spread can be developed and tested. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Labor, in contrast to capital, is much more tied to places, it is highly differentiated according to place-specific histories, social experiences, cultural contexts, and such. Yet, labor, and people more generally, are moving globally in ever greater volumes. Some of these international migration patterns are long-standing, and precede globalization's ascendance in the last three decades.Others appear to be evolutionary, and derive their added complexity and unruliness from globalization's influences. Some others might even be regarded as direct consequences of globalization, or indirectly the result of social, economic and political upheavals and restructuring that has lead to this 'new age of migration'. One particular characteristic of this new-age, dynamic process is its 'unruliness', its unregulated, or difficult to regulate, nature, and its volatility and unpredictability. Another characteristic is its rapidly changing mix, with traditional distinctions between highly-skilled migration and lowskilled migration across borders becoming blurred as global mobility is accompanied by upward social mobility and increases in social, cultural and human capital stocks for many in both classes, such that middle-class increases are gathering pace.Attainment of the 'immigrant dream' is becoming more and more possible, despite the unruliness, the unpredictable and volatile times and the often desperate beginnings of the global journey. And, this chapter details this contemporary complexity, drawing distinctions between migration's unruliness that empowers people and brings positive returns and unruliness that endangers, disadvantages and often abuses and denies basic human rights to many of the millions involved in irregular flight. These latter 'unruly movers' seek the right to better livelihood opportunities by moving 'across borders', albeit without legal permission to enter or work in that 'other man's world'. Yet, anarchic unruliness at the borders, rising anti-immigrant national xenophobia, and unscrupulous migration facilitators-traffickers, smugglers, and criminal syndicates, and the like-only make their irregular world(s) more dangerous places and 'spaces'. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84895236547"

The model is used to test the relative influence of local fiscal and public goods versus household-level characteristics in determining household location choices across central city and suburban school districts. Results provide evidence of both a ""natural evolution"" of households to the suburbs, due to job location, residential filtering, and household income and lifecycle effects, and ""flight from blight,"" due to lower school quality, higher crime levels, and lower average income levels in the city. In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that school quality exerts the strongest influence: a 1-percent increase in the school quality of the city district increases the probability of choosing a city residence by 3.7 percent. In contrast, the effects of household income and other individual characteristics are relatively modest. The findings provide support for a ""flight from blight"" suburbanization process that is dominated by differences in neighborhood quality between the city and suburbs. An implication is that investments that promote central city development and reduce suburbanization are justified on efficiency grounds if negative externalities are generated by increased concentration of poverty, crime, and low school quality. © Blackwell Publishers, 2006.","","Columbus [Ohio]; North America; Ohio; United States; homeowner; housing; logit analysis; residential location; suburbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745939967"

These schemes have been successfully deployed in wired networks, which have high computational and bandwidth capabilities. Mobile ad hoc networks, however have limited resources and hence deploying such schemes are impractical. We propose a lightweight, low-computation, distributed intrusion detection scheme for mobile ad hoc networks termed the Distributed Hierarchical Graph Neuron (DHGN). The DHGN-based network is a new form of neural network, which consists of a hierarchical graph-based representation of input patterns. This pattern recognition scheme adopts a divide-and-distribute approach that divides an input pattern into a number of subpatterns, which are then concurrently processed for recognition. The first section of this paper provides an in-depth study of mobile ad hoc networks and current intrusion detection implementation in these networks. The second section of the paper provides an overview of the proposed two-stage cooperative intrusion detection system architecture and compares the proposed algorithm with Self Organizing Map classifier. The experiments show that our low computational scheme produced similar classification accuracy results to Self Organizing Map algorithm.

In particular, societies have always contested the distinction between “legitimate,” state-sanctioned violence and coercion and its “illegitimate” counterparts, between war and peace and war-making and policing, between military and civilian, between insurrection or political violence and crime, and between legal and illegal violence, and have drawn the boundaries between these categories differently at different times. In making sense of all these distinctions, it might seem at first that little of general value can be said, except that coercion and violence form part of the interactive networks that hold large-scale societies together, as well as drive them apart (sometimes irrevocably), and that the capacity to assemble and deploy armed forces is an essential attribute of the state, without which it disappears. However, existing models of state formation offer more than this. The classic works of Otto Hintze and Max Weber, as well as the work of contemporary scholars such as Michael Mann and Charles Tilly, offer a highly suggestive analysis of European state formation, a “stylized fact” that consists of the following assertions. First, “war made the state and the state made war” — states survived, defeated other states and incorporated their territory, grew and prospered by mobilizing the resources, weaponry, and men to fight wars.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924582484"

The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time. Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses.

Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization. © 1990, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Design: Drivers' daytime handheld cell phone use was observed in four New York communities and two Connecticut communities. Observations were conducted one month before the ban, shortly after, and 16 months after. Driver gender, estimated age, and vehicle type were recorded for phone users and a sample of motorists. Intervention: Effective 1 November 2001, New York became the only state in the United States to ban drivers' handheld cell phone use. Connecticut is an adjacent state without such a law. Sample: 50 033 drivers in New York, 28 307 drivers in Connecticut. Outcome measures: Drivers' handheld cell phone use rates in New York and Connecticut and rates by driver characteristics. Results: Overall use rates in Connecticut did not change. Overall use in New York declined from 2.3% pre-law to 1.1% shortly after (p<0.05). One year later, use was 2.1%, higher than immediately post-law (p<0.05) and not significantly different from pre-law. Initial declines in use followed by longer term increases were observed for males and females, drivers younger than 60, and car and van drivers; use patterns varied among the four communities. Publicity declined after the law's implementation. No targeted enforcement efforts were evident. Cell phone citations issued during the first 15 months represented 2% of all traffic citations. Conclusions: Vigorous enforcement campaigns accompanied by publicity appear necessary to achieve longer term compliance with bans on drivers' cell phone use.","","Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Automobile Driving; Cellular Phone; Crime; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; New York; Sex Factors; adult; age distribution; article; community; driving ability; female; human; law enforcement; male; mobile phone; motor vehicle; sex difference; traffic safety; United States; age; aged; car driving; crime; legal aspect; middle aged; statistical model; statistics; traffic accident; utilization review","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-2142806697"

METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients with medically intractable HFS underwent MVD under general anesthesia. Pre-operative MRI examination was made for all cases to exclude space occupying lesion and magnetic imaging tomographic angiography (MRTA) was conducted for 145 cases of them instead of routine MRI. RESULTS: Routine MRI failed to provide information about offending vessels except for ruling out mass lesions whereas MRTA revealed the offending vessels with a positive rate of 82.8%, thus helping make correct diagnosis and operation decision. Follow-up of more than two years showed that the surgical intervention achieved a high relief rate of 91.2% without major complication, and with a low recurrence rate of only 3.5% after averaging more than two years' follow-up. CONCLUSION: Pre-operative MRTA can replace conventional MRI as a best approach for pre-operational etiological diagnosis of facial spasm. It helps perceive the offending vessels before operation. Skilled microsurgical technique along with correct recognition and mobilization of offending vessels are a must to assure MVD a high efficacious and low risk treatment of choice for HFS patients.","","Adult; Aged; Decompression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hemifacial Spasm; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Treatment Outcome; adult; aged; article; decompression; female; follow up; hemifacial spasm; human; magnetic resonance angiography; male; middle aged; postoperative complication; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035949976"

Development trends are tending to reinforce spatial divisions and fragmentation rather than assist urban integration. The consequences are costly to the poor majority through separation from economic and social opportunities. There are costs too for the wider urban economy and society arising from inefficient transport patterns, social disruption linked to concentrated poverty, and lost investment and jobs as a result of crime and insecurity. There is an urgent need for practical policies and concrete actions in pursuit of urban integration. The new Unicity authority offers considerable scope for an invigorated approach. There is useful experience to build upon within the city, including strategic planning frameworks and expertise in project implementation. This needs to be drawn together, reviewed in several important respects and given stronger political backing, financial muscle and technical support. The concept of a metropolitan development vision could be used to promote common city-wide interests and generate greater commitment to spatial, economic and social integration. The idea of urban transformation projects could provide the focus and stimulus to mobilise the efforts of diverse actors around practical schemes with long-term progressive potential. © 2001 Transaction Publishers.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548052706"

This study examines changes in the scale, method, structure and visibility of heroin and other drug distribution in New South Wales (NSW), and in the incidence of possession and use of heroin and other drugs associated with this reduction in heroin availability. Police incident data on possession/use of illicit drugs and on incidents of acquisitive crime were analysed using time-series analysis. Key informants (n= 71) from NSW law enforcement and health agencies and heroin users (n=53) were interviewed regarding changes in the drug market following the reduced availability of heroin. NSW police reports were accessed for information on police investigations into drug crime and related activities. Drug distribution in NSW appeared to change around the time of the heroin shortage. High-level distribution of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine may have remained somewhat discretely man-aged by different organized crime groups but greater collaboration occurred between these groups. Among mid-level distributors, there appeared to be a shift in emphasis from heroin to other drug distribution. Low-level dealers may have made a short-term shift from heroin to cocaine distribution. Low-level drug dealing also appeared to shift towards mobile and less overt methods of dealing. The number of street-level dealers reduced and in the longer-term, visibility of the drug markets decreased. There were significant decreases in police incidents of heroin possession/use reported by police, which were more marked among males and younger persons. At the same time, increases were observed in incidents for cocaine possession/use. There was a sustained decrease in theft offences but a temporary increase in robbery offences during the peak period of reduced availability. This appeared to represent a shift in the criminal behaviour of users remaining in the market and was associated with changes in drug-use patterns. Although the motivation behind the offending behaviour remained the same over time, cocaine use was associated with more violent crime. The method and structure of illicit drug distribution changed along with reduced heroin supply and carried implications for the policing of drug markets. Australia does not have a large cocaine market and the findings may have differed in countries where cocaine is in more ready supply.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-11844261741"

The investigation consisted of a range of interviews and observations in this institution, aimed at establishing the extent to which the national language policy is actually being implemented on the ground. Findings suggest that the use of English predominates in the high, official domains, that there is a marked avoidance of Afrikaans, and that Xhosa, the main language of the Eastern Cape Province, increasingly occupies the lower, unofficial domains. Tensions between policy and practice are discussed, and it is argued that the CS has shown that pragmatism is a much stronger force than ideology. While the roles of Xhosa and Afrikaans appear to be in the process of reversing in the Grahamstown prison, English has emerged as stronger there than it has ever been before. And because it will continue to be a necessary prerequisite for the mobility and promotion of staff in the country as a whole, and the lingua franca for an increasingly mobile criminal population (which means the prisons are likely to become increasingly linguistically diverse, rather than settling into regional patterns), everyone will have to have some proficiency in English, which, ironically, will promote and strengthen it even more. © 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937380098"

Based on oral and archival sources, this article attempts to disaggregate, periodise and construct an understanding of those forms of cultural organisation which came to be known as amalaita. In Durban the amalaita emerged in the wake of the massive social dislocation experienced by African societies in Natal and Zululand in the late nineteenth century. It is argued that they were first and foremost migrant youth organisations whose members adapted a repertoire of Zulu rural cultural practices and forms of self-organisation to cope with new conditions of life in town. This is an interpretation supported by oral testimonies although even within popular memory itself the meaning of the term is sometimes extended to include relatively discrete forms of adult migrant and even criminal association, for reasons which the article explains.Although the amalaita cannot be described as ‘political' in any advanced sense, their organisation and consciousness could, at times, provide the basis for more concerted challenges to local political authority. While the cultural idioms of Zulu youth were absorbed into a local popular political culture after 1925, there is also evidence to suggest the mobilisation of certain youth gangs by ICU activists. It is also argued that official attempts to de-politicise popular cultural expression together with qualitative changes in police control and the rapid social transformation of local society, had, by the late Thirties, begun to re-mould patterns of migrant youth association in Durban. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

They come to the city seeking better economic opportunities. In the rural areas, opportunities are severely limited by unequal land ownership, the vast majority of the land being concentrated in the hands of a small number of very wealthy families. In addition, agricultural productivity and incomes are low and population growth is rapidly increasing pressure on available land. The result is environmental degradation in many areas. Thus, many rural people move to the cities in the hope of finding better livelihoods. Urban life means a marked change in lifestyle for the rural migrant. Jobs tend to be more specialized and frequently require skills that the migrant needs to develop. Economic interdependence is high, as households are no longer in a position to produce as much of what they consume. In sum, new social, economic, and political characteristics evolve as urbanization advances. On the average, residents of urban areas in Latin America have higher incomes than people in rural areas. Additionally, they have better access to education and health services and to improved and more diversified services, such as water and electricity. They enjoy a much wider range of work, recreation, and social interaction opportunites. Cities in Latin America do have a number of problems, such as massive slums, high unemployment, transportation congestion, rapidly increasing land prices resulting from diminishing land availability, high pollution levels, and crime. Lima, Peru is an example of a problem ridden city. Its population increased from 600,000 in 1940 to over 5 million at present. Lima concentrates 1/4 of the country's population but over half the gross national product (GNP), 3/5 of the industrial firms, and 3/4 of the bank deposits. Despite this concentration of economic activity, the state of the city's housing and service infrastructure is deplorable. There are increasing numbers of people living in conditions of abject poverty. Over 1/3 of the city's population lives in some 400 ""pueblos jovenes,"" or recent low income settlements on the outer urban rim. Only half the households in these settlements have water and electricity indoors. Schools are very few, and hospitals nonexistent. In Latin America there is wide variation in urbanization levels, pace, and patterns. Generally, the higher the level of urbanization the lower the rate of urban population growth. The diversity in urbanization suggests that research subjects and methods necessary to provide solutions to the problems should also be diverse.","","Americas; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Latin America; Peru; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Poverty; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Rural Population; Social Problems; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; Transients and Migrants; Urban Population; Urbanization; Americas; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Latin America; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; Peru; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Poverty; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Rural-urban Migration; Social Problems; Social Welfare; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; Spatial Distribution; Urban Population; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization; spatial distribution; article; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; Geographic Factors; geography; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; Peru; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; poverty; rural population; Rural-urban Migration; social problem; social welfare; socioeconomics; South America; South and Central America; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization; Western Hemisphere","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021118305"

A detailed study of the pilot pattern geology provided an understanding of the major controls on fluid flow in the foam pattern. Pattern performance data, falloff testing, profile surveys, and interwell tracer results were integrated into the geologic model to guide project design work and provide a framework for interpretation of foam performance. Localized regions of high permeability resulting from solution enhancement of the matrix pore system appear to be the primary cause of the early CO2 breakthrough and channeling of injected CO2 toward the problem production well in the foam pattern. Positive response to foam injection is indicated by reduced injectivity and injection profile data in the foam injection well; by results from time sequence monitor logging in the observation well; and by changes in production performance in the high GOR, 'offending' production well in the foam pattern. Hall plots and pressure falloff testing were used to measure in situ changes in fluid mobility near the foam injection well. Time sequence logging responses at an observation well located 150 feet from the foam injector provided evidence of changes in fluid flow patterns in response to foam injection. Positive response to foam injection is further evidenced by changes in the CO2 production and oil rate performance at the 'offending' production well in the foam pilot pattern.","","Carbon dioxide; Enhanced recovery; Foams; Injection (oil wells); Petroleum reservoir engineering; Carbon dioxide foams; Foam injection; Pilot test; Oil well production","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028098852"

However, these networks are vulnerable to attackers due to certain inherently vulnerable characteristics. With intrusion prevention measures not guaranteed to work all the time, the need to constantly monitor what is going on in a system and look for intrusions is fulfilled by intrusion detection systems (IDS). In this paper, we have proposed a novel and robust IDS for MANETs that aims to combine misuse with anomaly detection. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme that detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms. Experimental results indicate the non-degradability of network performance when our IDS is incorporated in the routing algorithm for security enhancements.","Ad hoc; Intrusion detection; Security; Self-adjusting threshold; Wireless","Algorithms; Computer crime; Cryptography; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Packet networks; Security of data; Ad hoc networks; Intrusion detection systems (IDS); Self-adjusting threshold; Wireless telecommunication systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4544334682"

Factors were identified as anxiety (U.I. 24), assertiveness (U.I. 16), self-assuredness (U.I. 28), realism (U.I. 25), mobilization (U.I. 23), stolidness (U.I. 30), objectivity (U.I. 20), inhibition (U.I. 17), and passiveness (U.I. 18). Cluster analysis grouped patients into four categories: (i) 'primary/secondary' and (ii) 'subcultural' psychopaths, both low on inhibition; and (iii) 'overcontrolled' and (iv) 'violent aggressive' groups, both high on inhibition. Primary psychopaths and overcontrolled patients were higher on realism, mobilization, and objectivity. Different patterns of age, sex, intelligence, personality and criminal records supported the interpretation of these clusters. Low inhibition (along with assertiveness and mobilization) was associated with 'crimes without deterrents' and high inhibition (along with stolidness, low mobilization, and low realism) with 'crimes of passion'. Discriminant analyses for crimes correctly classified about 65% of patients, but for more infrequent crimes, there were twice as many false positives as actual offenders. In one, two and three year follow-ups, recidivists showed more stolidness (U.I. 30) and more subcultural conformity (U.I. 20-). Violent recidivists were less expressive (U.I. 28) than other groups. From the WAIS, neuropsychological tests, and neurological diagnoses, the suggestion is made that frontal-temporal impairments show decrements in assertiveness and realism, while more diffuse impairments would affect mobilization. High rather than low inhibition was more likely to be associated with impairment, typically lateralized to the right hemisphere. © 1980.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-31144436260"

Routine activities theory, which assumes freedom of action and rational choice, is used here to analyze patterns of intimate violence, especially, child sexual abuse. Marcus Felson's model of predatory crime provides a unique interpretation of intimate violence. Criminal incidents involve the physical convergence of three elements: a motivated offender; a suitable target; and the absence of a capable guardian. The convergence of these factors in intimate violence is analyzed; the potential of routine activity theory in explaining domestic abuse is assessed. Finally, suggestions for crime control in intimate violence based on routine activities theory are presented.","","battered woman; child abuse; clergy; day care; etiology; family; family violence; human; intimacy; motivation; priority journal; psychological theory; review; school; social isolation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030976873"

The writers hypothesized that a comparison of the no-pattern group with the remainder of the offenders would reveal differ ences that would show why these 71 criminals did not evince any particular pattern. They also hypothesized that the no-pattern group might consist of two subgroups—one bright and highly mobile (in terms of shifts toward more “advanced” types of crime), and a second so dull that more experienced criminals would not accept them as apprentices. However, bright, mobile offen ders were almost nonexistent in the no-pattern group, indicating that criminal progression of adult criminals takes place within, not between, specific types of crime. While intellectually dull, the no-pattern group was no more so than the whole sample, so that lack of intellectual ability does not seem to be the cause of their lack of pattern. The introverted, “marginal” character of their personal relations suggests that these offenders showed no pattern because they did not have close enough contact with other criminals to learn effective techniques. Because of their naïveté in criminal operations and consequently their frequent incarceration, they were shunned by other criminals. Thus, they were further limited in their opportunities to learn a single, “sophisticated” pattern of crime. © 1962, Sage Publications.

The article then looks at Stalin's 1947 campaign against theft. As in earlier campaigns, legal officials and criminal sanctions were mobilised in a merciless struggle against those who threatened Stalin's economic policies. As on earlier occasions the 1947 offensive also drew on Stalin's personal authority and was supported by a nationwide media blitz and by an emergency communications system which involved the use of telegrams and 'special lists'. As such the 1947 war on theft will be regarded as a form of 'campaign justice'. The article goes on to show that by 1947 rules and incentives acted as a brake on 'campaign justice'. By comparison with campaign justice in the 1930s the criminal justice agencies were relatively constrained. Notwithstanding the strong terms in which this campaign was couched, the article shows how, in an analogue to the social and moral conservatism that had set in elsewhere in Soviet life, the internal world of the justice bureaucracies had by this time become comparatively rigid and governed by a relatively uniform and conservative set of social values. While being more constrained, the question of whether the pattern of rewards and penalties in the command economy and in the criminal justice system was sufficient to foil the ambitions of the political leadership, as the Dunmore thesis would imply, is a more complex issue, and is dealt with at the end of the article.","","Russian Federation; historical geography; legislation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033405070"

Social change here is defined in terms of changes in basic societal institutions, such as family, religion and education. Individuals maturing in society internalize institutional patterns and learn to live by them. The key factor in the interaction of groups according to institutional patterns is the establishment ofbasic norms of conduct. Criminal behavior is defined as deviation from these norms. Possibly the most urgent question facing all societies today is how to maintain a reasonable equilibrium in the face of accelerated social change so that the benefits of this change are not offset by a concomitant increase in crime. When societal institutions change, the character of the control that institutions exert on norms of conduct also change. One important observation the author makes in this respect is that all societies seem to move from tight institutional integration to social disintegration where institutions no longer interlock or re-enforce each other. This is particularly evident in regard to the influence of the family, religion and education upon young people, and has led to what is popularly termed a more “permissive” society where there is a great deal less restriction on an individual's social, physical and intellectual mobility. As the author indicates, social changes of this sort are a “mixed bag”. On the one hand it has resulted in an enormous increase in economic wealth, material well-being and educational enbghtenment, while on the other it has left individuals without adequate ethical frames of reference, producing an increase in criminal behavior. Central to this overall problem is the relationship ofthe law, since it is ditlicult to define human behavior with the specificity demanded by the law. Two features of the law are relevant to any consideration of criminality in the context of social change: its durability and its tendency to expand. Laws usually remain long after customs pertaining to them have fallen into disuse, and social change introduces new concepts ofwhat is permissible and what is not, but the law is often slow to adopt these new concepts. In addition, as modem society becomes more complex, the mere quantity of laws tends to multiply to a bewildering degree to the extent where the honest citizen can unknowingly commit any number of offenses unknown to preceding generations. One example is the effect industrialization has had to produce a welter of new areas of crime, such as traffic offenses, organized crime and white collar crime together with a blurring of the distinction of what constitutes criminal acts and shrewd business practices. Closely connected with this is the highly technical problem of judicial flexibility versus judicial restraint. The author feels nevertheless that if social change in handled wisely crime might even diminish. A number of suggestions are presented to deal with these perplexing questions. Perhaps a greater distinction would be made between criminal and non-criminal acts. In addition, there could be a greater individualization of justice when a violation of a criminal law was unintentional. There are also a number of important questions in regard to the law. Is the law the best teacher, or is it too formalized and ought a greater reliance be placed on education? If the law doesn’t grow or change, is the solution simply to expand the enforcing area? If goals are to be set for the most unstable societal element, namely the youth culture, what is the nature of these goals? Finally, it is obvious that the minimizing of crime requires careful planning, but planning to achieve positive social and economic results.

Fighting for the right to shape their economies, cultures, and politics according to their values within their own communities and towns, indigenous people claim space, both real and imagined, in a highly specific way. Economically, territorial autonomy suggests the enduring power of subsistence production, by which agriculture divides indígenas from industrialized mestizos (Nash 2001). Ethnically, it posits white-mestizo urban places faced off against a vulnerable native hinterland. Politically, it locates legitimacy in a decentralized landscape of bounded peasant sectors (for the Sierra), rather than sprawling urban shantytowns. Drawing on centuries of racial discourse, class subordination, and cultural resistance, the struggle for territorial autonomy tactically energizes the native movement. It even taps currents of neoliberal thinking about devolution of power from the state to private citizens to achieve backing from both the state and the World Bank. Cities and urban careers of native peoples, however, challenge the premises of territorial autonomy. For decades, rural communities, especially those of Quichua-speaking Andean people on whom I focus here, have been emptying themselves into cities, large and small. While publications about indigenous people and their politics play up natural cosmologies, peasant organizations, and agriculture, native people themselves often live a composite of rural and urban lives. They work in cities, rent apartments, baptize children in urban congregations, shop in markets, and organize city-based economic and political associations. A political vision of autonomy anchored in bounded rural enclaves ignores this breadth of urban knowledge and experience. If urban life has always fit poorly in countrified theories of native people, globalization raises still more concerns about the city as an empowering lo- cale for indigenous society-or indeed for any ethnic or national identity that rests on the connections between people and places. Cities have been on the front lines of financial capitalist integration, pop culture trends, brand name consumerism, intercontinental migrant flows, and the creolization of everything from cuisine to music. As James Holston (1996:189) recently argued, the transnational flow of ideas, goods, images, and peoples ""drives a deeper wedge between national space and urban centers."" For native peoples who have tenuous claims on urbanity and citizenship, the accelerated, crimeridden, globally connected millennial city can be especially problematic. In this chapter, I challenge conventional understandings about autonomy and show how city lives can foster a connectivity that reinforces a Quichua community's push for self-determination. The space, mobility, and rhythm of urban autonomy break from the bounded vision of political-territorial autonomy discussed by most writers. Living in cities, indigenous people interact repeatedly within their communities and outside of them in fluid ways less tied to categorical divisions of place and people. Community stability and effectiveness, whether manifest in development projects or collective responses to crises, grows not through sovereignty over a place, but through interactions. Elsewhere, I write of this as ""relational autonomy""-a potent, situational capacity to engage powerful others according to one's values (Colloredo-Mansfeld 2002). Here, I want to examine more thoroughly the place-making activities that pattern social and ethnic relations. Particularly, I document where indigenous people tap the city's power for encounter and connection. When able, indigenous migrants develop such capacity by distributing their lives across places-by means of artisan production and sales, social spending, schooling, and formal and informal projects of mutual assistance-rather than by anchoring them within a primary location. In contrast to political-territorial assumptions about the importance of production, locales of exchange often orient creative effort and social contacts. At other times, though, migrants convene in the city's liminal spaces, such as sidewalks next to government offices, street corner miniparks, or parking areas of a tenement building. Here, in the urban interstices, the settings of action deliver few symbolic resources, thereby placing the burden of communication and coherence directly on the assembled people, for better or worse. In exploring how cities have empowered (and constrained) indigenous people, I focus on Tiguan migrants, members of a Quichua community with ties to Cotopaxi Province but who now live primarily in Quito. Hailing from about a half dozen peasant sectors of Guangaje Parish, colloquially known as Tigua for its river, the migrants number in the hundreds and live dispersed throughout Quito's southern neighborhoods and subur ban fringe: Ecuatoriana, Guamaní, Gaupichu, and Santo Domingo de Cutalagua. I look, in particular, at three dynamics. First, I trace urban institutions that Tiguans have developed to boost the economic and social clout of their art. While stereotyped as rural commerce that finds outlets in cities, native art as developed by Tiguans has often flowed in reverse. Throughout the 1980s, Tiguan artists shaped markets and development projects to channel urban artistic innovation and economic resources back into the countryside. Second, I briefly look at the preoccupations of adolescent boys, sons of the pioneering generation of migrants, and their restless mobility. Moving from the fixed points of family life, they develop their interests not by laying the foundations to settle down but by pushing the boundaries of their reach-their knowledge of markets, schools, and neighborhoods and their economic, social, and cultural capital to exploit the opportunities found there. Third, I consider the engagement of Tiguans with urban legal authorities. Coordinating with one another to cope with a capricious (or corrupt) legal system, migrants remind themselves of both their distance from the institutions of state power and of their mutual obligations to one another. Following these processes, one direction leads to neoliberal structural reforms and the pressures of globalization. Ecuador's fitful efforts to solve its generation-long economic crisis with promarket policies have spurred a massive growth in the informal economy. Tiguans, for the most part, toil in this sector, cut off from subsistence safeguards, let alone possibilities for advancement. In neoliberal Ecuador, ""informal"" does not mean ""alternative. "" Exclusion from the circuits of capital does not mean escape from daily competition, nor from the power of newly wealthy Quichua economic entrepreneurs, nor from the pressures of measuring up to an international level of consumerism. Following the ethnographic lines in another direction, though, brings out the distinctive achievements of Tiguans. Their art counts here. By inventing a rich visual vocabulary, they have broadcast the energy of their fiestas, farming, curing rituals, and rural livelihoods to wide audiences. By so doing, Tiguans have also generated an economic vitality that restored, at least for a brief time, the partial autonomy and dignity once taken from them by backbreaking commercial farm work. A related dynamism thrives within their community associations. These indigenous organizations grow in Quito's cluttered swathes of market stalls, smoggy bus interchanges, vendorcolonized parks, and decaying modernist state offices. As both urban and Quichua collectivities, they are attuned to passing opportunities for community- oriented projects, even during an era of crisis. Copyright © 2003 by the University of Iowa Press.

Knowing why people moved, it seemed, presented a potential for fostering neighborhood stability, place oriented community and a cure for urban ills such as crime, delinquency and other forms of anomic behavior. The finding that residential mobility was neither pathological nor indicative of normlessness but was a normal process through which families improve their housing situations set the tone for later mobility research. The myriad of studies on mobility precipitants and housing adjustment processes have, today, firmly established the finding that residential shifts are driven by family compositional changes accompanying family life cycle stages. Without a problems context, it appears that residential mobility research has little obvious relevance to public policy concerns. To be relevant to public policy, we propose that mobility research change focus from looking at the precipitants of residential moves toward looking at the mechanisms that structure the patterning of residential choices within metropolitan areas. We present some new directions for mobility research dealing with factors governing housing production and its spatial distribution along with why and where people live where they do. 1982 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020409574"

True, there have been significant interruptions in the upward course of per capita growth, most notably during the Great Depression. Although we could not always answer positively to Ronald Reagan's famous 1980 presidential debate question, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" most of us are unambiguously better off than our grandparents were fifty years ago, or their grandparents fifty years earlier.1 The distribution of prosperity, however, unlike the aggregate, has not followed a monotonic path. The broad outline of what happened is easy to summarize. Inequality in income and wealth decreased for much of the twentieth century. The decrease in inequality appeared to fit the hypothesis of Simon Kuznets (1955): As industrialization led a larger fraction of the population to enter high-productivity activities, inequality fell. The fall in inequality, however, has been arrested and reversed. When inequality started to rise depends on which measure one uses, but the reversal did not start before the late 1960s and was clearly in full bloom before-not after-Reagan took office. In this essay, I document that the long-run trend in inequality-decreasing for roughly the first three-quarters of the twentieth century and increasing thereafter-is matched by similar trends in public policy and political polarization, and I discuss the implications of these parallel trends. I focus on public policies, such as taxes and minimum wages, that are tied to inequality, since they are explicitly redistributive. For example, David Lee (1999, 979) finds that ""almost all of the growth in the wage gap between the tenth and fiftieth percentile is attributable to the erosion of the real value of the federal minimum during the [1980s]."" Estate taxes became more onerous for the first three-quarters of the century before reversing in the late 1970s. Top marginal income taxes increased before starting a decline in the 1960s. The federal minimum wage took root in 1938 and increased, in real terms, until the late 1960s but then declined precipitously. I later document in more detail how minimum wages and taxes closely tracked the secular pattern of inequality. As inequality among Americans fell during the first two-thirds or three-quarters of the twentieth century, Americans also seemed to have grown closer together politically. In 1960 the sociologist Daniel Bell published The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties. A year later the political scientist Robert Dahl (1961) pointed to a nation moving from oligarchy to pluralism. Similarly, the new ""rational choice"" school in political science emphasized Tweedle-Dee-Tweedle-Dum parties focused on the median voter (Downs 1957) and members of Congress largely concerned with constituency service (Fiorina 1978) and universalism in pork barrel politics (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). What these authors pointed to was echoed in analyses of roll-call voting patterns in the House and Senate. Put simply, the fraction of moderates grew and the fraction of extreme liberals and extreme conservatives fell from 1900 to about 1975 (Poole and Rosenthal 1997; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 1997). Just as inequality went from falling to rising in the last quarter of the century, we witnessed a turnaround in politics. Keith Poole and I have termed this ""the polarization of American politics"" (Poole and Rosenthal 1984; see also Krugman 2002a, 2002b). Moderates are nearly extinct. Extreme liberals and extreme conservatives have surfaced, particularly extreme conservatives in the Republican Party. What, more precisely, are the changes in partisan positions that underlie polarization? The Republican Party in Congress moves from a very conservative position in 1900 to a substantially more moderate position in the 1970s before rebounding to 1900 conservatism in 2000. The Democratic Party becomes more moderate until the 1950s and then drifts, relatively slowly, to a more liberal position. The net effect of these changes is that the differences between the parties-polarization- narrow until the 1970s and then expand. My main focus-stimulated by the parallel trends in economic inequality, political polarization, and public policy-is on how politics and economic inequality relate and are coupled by economic policy. There is, in this respect, an abundance of alternative hypotheses about the rise of inequality. The list includes greater trade liberalization, increased levels of immigration, declining rates of trade unionization, the fall in the real minimum wage, a decline in progressive taxation, technological change increasing the returns to education, the increased rates of family dissolution and female-headed households, the aging of the population, pure racism, America's federal political system, gridlocked national politics, and the absence of proportional representation in elections (for an overview of some of these topics, see Atkinson 1997; see also Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacredote 2001). Most of these factors are either directly political or potentially affected by public policy. Technological change, however, would appear to respond to many forces that are independent of government policy. Similarly, the decline of marriage is universal throughout the Western world. The roots of this may be just as much in technological changes that affect work in the household and in changes in lifestyle as in the changes in incentives produced through welfare and other public policies. Nonetheless, politics and public policy remain the focus of this essay. An important aspect of the increase in inequality is that it has indeed taken place during a period of substantial economic growth. Although the quadrupling, from 1970 to 2000, of the proportion of the population who are incarcerated (Western, Kleykamp, and Rosenfeld, this volume) suggests that many African American males may not be better off than their grandparents, by and large the increase in inequality is not a matter of pauperization. 2 Although there is debate as to whether the lower end of the income distribution is somewhat worse off or has remained relatively stable in economic status, it has pretty clearly not gotten much worse off. Moreover, a substantial segment of the lower tail consists of immigrants who are much better off than they were in their nation of origin. At the same time, in the middle and at the top end of the income distribution, voters have become much richer. This is not just because the growth rate of income at each centile has been increasing in the centile. The poor who are eligible to vote increasingly vote less than the rich. In addition, nonvoting legal and illegal immigrants tend to be poor. Another factor, but quantitatively less important than immigration, arises from growth in the number of incarcerated Americans and ineligible ex-felons (on both criminals and immigrants in voter turnout, see McDonald and Popkin 2001). Prosperity, immigration, and criminal justice policy combine to mute the political response to inequality. This chapter proposes an account of the political and institutional forces that are likely to blunt a movement toward redistributive economic policies. Rising wealth and incomes have created a sizable constituency with a vested interest in the status quo, while the growing share of noncitizens and disenfranchised ex-offenders reduces the political power of the poor. As I discuss later, these shifts in the electorate take place in the context of institutional features of the American political system that give economic policies a kind of ""stickiness,"" particularly given the polarization discussed earlier. Once established, economic policies that affect the distribution of income tend to be slow to change. The essay proceeds as follows. A theoretical overview of the political economy of inequality is provided in the next section. This section also briefly applies the theoretical perspective to an understanding of events in the twentieth century. In the following section, I make some international comparisons and highlight how the Great Depression, World War II, and the 1960s represented exceptional events for the United States. I suggest how politics might be relevant to differences in inequality across nations. In the next section, I document the polarization of politics in the United States. The following section links that political polarization to outcomes in income and wealth inequality and immigration. That is followed by a section in which I argue that increases in aggregate income and wealth and in immigration are acting to mute any political response to inequality. Finally, I show how changes in public policies on taxes and minimum wages correspond with changes in inequality and political polarization. This section also emphasizes that old-age insurance taxes follow an entirely different pattern from taxation that is explicitly redistributive.

Criminal justice practitioners who monitor offenders rely primarily upon urinalysis to detect drug use by their clientele. However, since drug distribution is a profitable enterprise for many, persons may continue to engage in drug sales even after desisting from use. In this paper we attempt to determine whether or not a distinct contamination profile exists for persons who admit continued involvement in drug sales and drug sales and use when contrasted to those who deny drug sales but continue to use or deny any drug involvement whatsoever. The findings of our examination and analysis are only moderately supportive of the discernable difference between users and distributors but sufficient, in our view, to continue examining the technology for a potential application to this problem.","","cocaine; analytic method; article; bioassay; cocaine dependence; drug contamination; drug exposure; drug traffic; human; spectrometer; spectrometry; urinalysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034074376"

The threat, real or imagined, confronted by successive governments had a major impact on the style of policing adopted. Threats to established states and the fear of communism after the Bolshevik Revolution led to the expansion of political policing in both democratic and authoritarian regimes. In Argentina, political policing came to dominate police and military activities. The need for it was believed to stem from the country's contentious nature, rooted in the foreign origins of its population. Social mobilization in Argentina was triggered before the new political institutions could attain a high level of legitimacy, aggravating the elite perception of civil strife as threatening the social order. The absence of a directly threatening external enemy and the limited character of wars may have coalesced to draw the army into the civilian realm. It is beyond the scope of this article to delve into other factors that led the armed forces to expand their role, such as the military mentality, authoritarian ideology, and fear of the popular classes. Certainly, its physical presence throughout the country and its involvement in the development of the economy and infrastructure gave it broader national scope than the police. In any event, the form of policing and police organization varied as a function of the place of the military in Argentina's history of contentious politics. As I have shown, the 1930 coup increased the repressiveness of the regime and spurred military intervention in policing. That is reflected in the recruitment pattern of the chiefs of police and ideological definitions of the enemy. From 1880, when the capital police was created, until September 1955, when Peron was ousted, 30 of 47 chiefs of police had been military men, most of them in active service.","","Argentina; police force; political process","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034054044"

Controlling for differential opportunity based on age of cohorts, twenty-two percent of this sample who were born in 1952 initiated use of heroin by age 18, compared to three percent of those born in 1957. The explanation that appears most plausible for these findings is that, for most individuals, the actions of initiating and continuing heroin use appear to be a product of rational choice.

Main, 124 out-patients of the special health centre in the city of Frankfurt a. Main) were steadily investigated between the years 1969/70 with the aid of a fixed catalogue consisting of 386 single criterions with quantitative and qualitative alternatives. The informations for instance on the development of the drug-user, his familiar and social situation, sexuality, drug-use, vegetative nervous system, constitution were registered by widely pre-defined lists of data. The psychological investigation was done among other examinations by the modified Hamburg-Wechsler-intelligence-test. Subsequently the facts of the investigation were evaluated with the aid of an electronic computing station; the analysis of the data obtained took place by aspects of statistical correlations. Complementary to our study Hausner investigated in the same way 100 drug-users directly accosted at the so-called ""scene"". General characteristics of the drug-users: 80% were aged between 16 and 24 years (just under 25% till 16, 50% till 21, 25% above 25 years). There were each 20% female drug-users among the in- and out-patients, but 40% among the population of the ""scene"". Only 3% of all drug-users exclusively took cannabis, just under 50% in addition halluzinogenic drugs, some more than the half opiates too. All drug-users took stimulants, most often the opiate-users; in number: two thirds of the stimulants were taken by them. 60% were addicted or respectively suspected. According to the particular social level there was a special affinity to certain drugs (working people prefered stimulants, pupils and students cannabis and halluzinogenic drugs). University education of the father was dominating at the users of hallucinogenic drugs, half of them became addicted during the time of observation. Opiate-users more often had fathers without university education, they planned their profession more frequently not themselves and had more often a social decline. Social situations of the drug-users: 36% were pupils or students, 12% in vocational training, 8% professional active. 42% pursued no more any job. The so-called ""drop-outs"" more frequently had stopped going to school or stopped their professional course of education, they planned their profession more often not themselves and their future more seldom longtermed, pupils of secondary schools or students had only an average or even more modest intelligence-quotient. Overstrain and absence of suitable helps for the choice of profession seem to be important factors as to a disadvantageous progress of the drug-career. Only 50% of the drug-users visiting secondary schools or universities had the intelligence-quotient required. The drug-use seems to become encouraged by conflicts concerning high demands standards combined with actual overstrain. 43% of the drug-users had a social decline in comparison with their descent family. Hence follow level-specific endangering patterns to the development of addictions which primary are multidimensional applied. 49% of all drug-users investigated were likely to have a progressive course of their drug-career. This average-probability augmented to 68%, when the parents were left in conflicts, and declined to 40%, when there was a harmonic atmosphere in the parent's house. Only 1% of the drug-users was not impaired in their social connections after a drug-use of 6 months. The following factors were able to inhibit these social detractions: The factor retardation (including a corresponding reaction of the environment) and the factor constitution. Further on it appeared that the taking of drugs in community decreased to 50% in the last 6 months of the drug-use compared with more than 80% in the first half year of the drug-use. That means: The operation of drugs does not lead to the primary intended partner-ship but to a disappearing in the world of own experiences. 19% of the investigated people were criminal before starting the drug-use (special concerning prosperity delicts); after that 52% were criminal, special concerning violations of the narcotic law, 25% of them because of dealing with drugs. In general it is to say that there are to consider interactions for instance between negative social development and drug operation on the central nervous system when analysing the constellations of risks in direction of adverse progresses. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.","","Adolescent; Adult; Amphetamine; Cannabis; Family Characteristics; Female; Hallucinogens; Human; Male; Opium; Social Mobility; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Student Dropouts; Substance-Related Disorders; amphetamine; cannabis; opiate; psychedelic agent; addiction; adolescent; adult; article; family size; female; human; male; mental stress; social class; socioeconomics; student","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0015266135"

The sample was stratified by year of identification as well as by race and consisted of equal numbers of blacks and whites. Personal interviews with subjects were conducted using a structured questionnaire, and a special staff was used to locate and obtain permission to interview. Of the 349 persons in the sample, 343 were located, with a substantial proportion being out-of-state. Among the 343 located, 57 were dead, two were psychotic, six were not located, and 17 refused to be interviewed.

The mean time-interval for police identification of respondents as narcotic users after the beginning of regular use was nearly five years, but the variation surrounding this figure was high. In particular, the figure was higher for blacks than for whites, with no consistent trend over time shown for either race. The year of first regular narcotic use for the interviewed sample ranged from 1910 to 197 1. Mean age at first regular narcotics use was 20.1 years overall, with very little difference between whites and blacks in this respect. Approximately one-fourth of those interviewed were currently using narcotics, about one-fifth were in treatment, and the remainder (56.9% reported themselves as not using narcotic drugs at the time It is emphasized that this paper represents only a preliminary step in the analysis and presentation of data obtained in a three-hour comprehensive interview.

This study of 'drop-out' patient shows that there are three categories of the so-called drop-outs: (i) the false 'drop-outs' (51%): these patients get transfer as per their convenience to other leprosy centres or medical services (private practitioners or consultants) within the city (ii) drop-outs due to migration: the migration is forced on them due to some genuine reason, and (iii) persistent offenders: this is a group of adamant, non co-operative, or, distressed patients. For the first two categories of patients it is advisable to introduce a good referral system. For the recalcitrant defaulters, supervised short-term drug therapy will probably be the best option.","","Female; Humans; India; Leprosy; Male; Patient Compliance; Patient Dropouts; Referral and Consultation; Residential Mobility; Urban Health Services; article; bacterium identification; demography; doctor patient relation; human; india; leprosy; major clinical study; migration; patient compliance; patient referral; treatment planning; urban population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030018331"

It does so within the paradigm of multi-choice policing, since in any situation there are often a surprising number of policing agencies offering localised protection of different levels of legality, effectiveness, availability, methods and services. The article examines Informal Organised Security Groups; Informal Commercial Security Croups; State Approved Civil Guarding; Dispute Resolution Forums; Religious Police; Ethnic/clan Militias; Political Party Militia Groups; Civil Defence Forces; and Traditional Courts. The overview finds both convergence with and divergence from South African policing as a result of historical, political and economic factors. The article concludes that multi-choice policing is engrained in every community of Africa with the specific form of policing protection chosen being determined by availability, cost and preference for their methods. Two important governance issues confront Africa. First, to establish both the scale of multi-choice policing and the contribution each group can make both to protection from crime, and to restorative and punitive responses to abuses. Second, to devise national strategies of law and order that integrate, regulate, mobilise and empower all those willing to preserve law and order in an acceptable manner. © 2004, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044803752"

As a response to increased threats, many Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) have been developed, but current NIDSs are barely capable of real-time traffic analysis on Fast Ethernet links. As network technology presses forward, Gigabit Ethernet has become the actual standard for large network installations. Therefore, there is an emerging need for security analysis techniques that can keep up with the increased network throughput. We have made effort to design and implement high-speed IDS that is run as a lower branch of our system named 'Network Security Control System (NSCS)'. Our IDS named 'Security Gateway System (SGS)' has a pattern matching approach through the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) logic and kernel logic as detection mechanism that can be applied to Gigabit-Ethernet links. In this paper, we briefly introduce the whole architecture of our system designed to perform intrusion detection on high-speed links. And then, we present the efficient detection mechanism that is run by cooperation of FPGA logic and kernel logic. In other words, we focus on the network intrusion detection mechanism applied in a lower branch of our system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","","Computation theory; Computer crime; Ethernet; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gateways (computer networks); Integrated circuit design; Mercury (metal); Mobile security; Network security; Pattern matching; Real time systems; Security of data; Design and implementations; Design and implements; Fpga(field programmable gate array); Intrusion Detection Systems; Network based intrusion detection systems; Network intrusion detection; Network technologies; Security control systems; Intrusion detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949670020"

The history of violence is traced back to struggles between the IFP and the ANC in the 1980s which interacted with differences in generational, moral and cultural out-look, as well as with conflicts between Zulu-speaking residents and immigrants from the Transkei. Since apartheid was dismantled, similar patterns of conflict have persisted, but now within a local context in which one political party holds almost total sway. Post-apartheid violence is related to rivalries around local state resources in a situation of continued poverty, and to moral and ideological disagreements which, since 1994, have been intensified by the HIV/AIDS epidemic as well as by an escalation of local crime. Strategies for the moral rehabilitation of local society, such as virginity testing, are discussed, as is the controversy around them, rooted in oppositions between youth and elders, and between different cultural styles. Finally, the mismatch between the concentration of political power at municipal ward level and the diversity of positions expressed in local civil society is raised as a reason why disagreements have continued to involve violent conflict. © Institute of Social Studies 2005.","","Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; crime; human immunodeficiency virus; political power; political violence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17744374953"

Primitive transferences that involve suspicion and hostility are mobilized from the very beginning, and sadomasochistic power struggles threaten the therapeutic alliance at all times. Case vignettes from the treatment of three Palestinians by an Israeli analyst illustrate how developmental traumas may be reenacted in the relationship with an ""enemy"" therapist. From the therapist's perspective, this relationship may necessitate considerable technical flexibility, as well as a willingness and a capacity to tolerate and contain paranoid, hateful, and sometimes murderous feelings within the therapeutic dyad. From the patient's perspective, this involves the difficult task of trusting the enemy. It is virtually impossible to disentangle the personal from the political under conditions of national conflict, and their overlap may contribute to the development of extreme cultural attitudes to terrorism. Against this backdrop, the choice of an ""enemy"" therapist may reflect patterns of deeply ambivalent object relations, and may offer an opportunity to work through them as both parties oscillate between hate and hope.","","Arab; article; case report; conflict; criminal behavior; cultural factor; doctor patient relation; emotionality; ethnic difference; female; hate; hostility; human; Israel; jew; male; masochism; object relation; Palestine; paranoia; politics; psychotherapy; psychotrauma; sadism; terrorism; transference; trust; war","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1542402074"

Qualitatively, Blacks and especially Hispanics who appear as crime suspects do so in more threatening contexts than Whites.

Police records for the Cumbrian (Westmorland) town of Kendal not only give details of the charges made in Kendal, but also list a large number of previous and subsequent offences including the place where the charge was made. Those who had no fixed address were often skilled and middle-aged, committed relatively minor offences but were quite harshly treated by the law. It seems likely that their high re-offence rate reflects the attitude of police to trampers rather than their predisposition to crime. Although those with no fixed address were more mobile than those with a fixed address, the pattern of their mobility was not atypical. 45.1% of those without a fixed address had moved only 31 miles (50 km) or less before re-offending and there is no significant difference in the length of time between the end of their sentence and another charge for the two groups. Those charged with crimes in Kendal rarely moved outside northern or midland England and most moved over relatively short distances within territory with which they were probably familiar. -from Author","","Cumbria; England; Kendal; UK; criminals; documentary source; historical studies; mobility pattern; nineteenth century","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028562924"

It is found that the type of crime chosen, as indicated by the charge at the time of arrest and the final charge, is influenced by sex, age, number of prior referrals to the court, ethnic extraction, and place of residence of the juvenile. As the effect of each of these individual characteristics on the probability of selecting the various crimes differs, the choice of crime exhibits dynamic features; as the individual age increases, and as the number of prior referrals to court increases, the probabilities of selecting particular crimes change.

The pattern currently emerging, pioneered in the care of the mentally ill, involves less exclusive reliance on highly trained treatment specialists and more infusion of treatment concerns and skills in line staff. Also, the boundary between institution and community treatment is becoming obscured because of new transitional pro cedures and facilities. Strains develop with these changes because of inmate and staff comfort in fixed statuses, defects in much new treatment, inadequate research to evaluate treatment, and failure to recog nize that optimum treatment varies with the type of offender. The changes also create severe manpower problems. Shortages in re search personnel can be met by new recruitment strategies and by procedures which combine operations and research records, thus improving both. The primary need, however, is in recruit ment and training of line personnel who are committed to cor rectional careers and oriented to correctional change. The Cor rectional Rehabilitation Study Act of 1965 mobilizes educational and professional organizations for coordinated effort to meet these needs. © 1966, Sage Publications.

In response to public concern about the presence of crack in residential neighborhoods, law enforcement agencies have implemented various law enforcement strategies aimed at reducing or eradicating drugs from urban environments. These strategies, however, have failed to consider crack users' mobility patterns. Because any effort to reduce crack consumption and distribution should consider these patterns, this research assesses the journey to purchase crack and suggests some areas of future research. Initially the research determines how far crack users travel to purchase drugs and considers whether crack users who travel less than.5 mile on average differ significantly from those who travel more than.5 mile. This study examines whether this difference is due to individuals’ socioeconomic factors to characteristics associated with the drug-buying event. Discriminant analysis shows that crack users travel varying distances to purchase the drug. In explaining these differences, gender is an important lifestyle indicator, and the tendency to “cop” in the user's residential neighborhood is a major event characteristic. Characteristics associated with the crack-buying event are generally more important than individual characteristics in explaining the distances traveled. © 1995 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042006400"
