- **Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind.""
  - ""To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police.""
  - ""Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making.""
  - ""The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular.""
  - ""For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River.""
  - ""In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours.""
  - ""The results suggest an unequivocal effect of propinquity (hypothesis 1) on offender spatial decision making, with offenders (young or old) being more likely to target areas that were closer to their area of residence.""
  - ""The estimates of population churn rates and ethnic heterogeneity were derived using data from the 2001 U.K. Census.""
  - ""To measure deprivation, we use the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 obtained from the U.K. Department for Communities and Local Government""
  - ""The variable used to measure contagion (hypothesis 11)-indicating the number of offenses in each area in the previous 24 hours-was significantly associated with target choice during the London riots,""

## KEY FINDINGS
- Physical barriers and connectors significantly influence target suburb utility.
- Barriers reduce the likelihood of offending, while connectors increase it.
- Distance has a differential effect on offender decision-making based on age.

## DATA QUALITY NOTES
- **Variable Information Quality:** Complete
- **Missing Information:** Not mentioned
- **Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin.""
  - ""The residential burglary data analysed here were provided by the Western Australian Police.""
  - ""The final dataset contained 1,761 singleoffender (actual or attempted) residential burglaries committed between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002 , where the offender resided in the city of Perth.""
  - ""The city of Perth is located in the south-west of Western Australia at the coast of the Indian Ocean.""
  - ""A total of 291 residential suburbs were selected as members of the possible choice set for the residential burglaries examined here.""
  - ""The essential elements involved with the application of discrete spatial choice are: (a) defining the boundaries of the choice set, (b) capturing the unique attributes of the decision-makers and (c) modelling the interaction between the individual chooser's characteristics and choice for the whole population""
  - ""The general utility formula, represented by Equation 2, included elements to simultaneously evaluate the impact of a range of factors believed to influence location choice.""
  - ""The parameter odds ratios and information about model performance are displayed in Table 3""
  - ""The conditional logit model tested here contained 12 parameters and provided an acceptable fit of the burglary target selection data, with McFadden's ρ 2 = 0.27.""
  - ""Physical barriers. Both of the selected barrier parameters performed as predicted.""
  - ""Connectors. As predicted, when an offender lived in a suburb that contained a train line, the likelihood of offending in a suburb that also had a train line increased""
  - ""Overall, the results for the barriers and connecters examined here were all statistically significant and demonstrated good support for the assumptions that connectors such as train lines, and physical barriers such as rivers and roads, do significantly influence target suburb utility.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=12 table_on_page=1>```markdown

## KEY FINDINGS
- Offenders are more likely to commit crimes in their current and former residential areas.
- Duration and recency of residence significantly affect crime location choices.
- Former areas are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived there for a longer period or left recently.

## DATA QUALITY NOTES
- Variable information quality: Complete
- Missing information: None noted
- Extraction confidence: High","  - ""Many offenders offend near their home. But what about their former homes?""
  - ""Extending crime pattern theory, and combining data on police recorded robberies with data on the residential histories of the robbers and with a database of postal code areas, we demonstrate that offenders are more likely to commit commercial robberies in their former residential areas than in otherwise similar areas they have never lived in.""
  - ""The first data source is the National Commercial Robbery Registration System (LORS), which is managed by the Dutch National Police Services Agency (KLPD).""
  - ""The second data source is the population registration data held in the Nationwide Citizen Information System (GBA).""
  - ""The third source of data is a database containing demographic, social and economic information on all postal code areas in the Netherlands.""
  - ""We first selected all 4657 robberies in the years 2004 and 2005.""
  - ""Subsequently the 1539 robberies were selected for which at least one person had been arrested and charged.""
  - ""We selected only the 398 robberies that had been committed by a solitary offender (as reported by victims or bystanders).""
  - ""In the present analysis, the residential history of a person is a list of one or more records that contain the postal code and the first and last date of residence.""
  - ""There are 4006 postal code areas nationwide; they have an average population size of 4900 and an average number of households of 2100.""
  - ""To test the four hypotheses on the role of residential history in robbers' target location choices, a method is required that compares the postal code areas that offenders targeted with alternative postal code areas that they did not target.""
  - ""The parameters in Table 2 are odd ratios, which indicate how much a one unit increase in an independent variable raises (if the odds ratio is above 1) or diminishes (if the odds ratio is below 1) the probability that the area is chosen as a crime location.""
  - ""The first column of estimates shows the outcomes of the model that confirms distance decay findings in the received literature.""
  - ""The area where the offender lives is 11.6 times more likely to be selected than an equivalent other area and, for each kilometre an area is further away from where the offender lives, the probability that it is chosen diminishes by a factor of 0.91 (i.e. it is 9 percent less likely to be chosen).""
  - ""Former areas are indeed 8.3 times more likely to be chosen than other comparable areas, and again the effect is highly significant.""
  - ""Former areas of residence are 10.3 times more likely to be targeted than other areas if the offender has lived in the area more than 2 years, and 6.9 times more likely if they have lived in the area for a shorter period of time.""
  - ""former areas are more likely to be chosen if the offender left the area less than 2 years ago (13.0 times more likely than an area where he or she never lived) than if the area was left longer ago (6.7 times more likely than an area where he or she never lived).""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=11 table_on_page=1>```markdown

- **Missing Information:** Some information not specified
- **Extraction Confidence:** Medium","  - ""This article examines to what extent repeat offenders' crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day.""
  - ""Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.""
  - ""Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day.""
  - ""The dependent variable represents the choice outcome, that is, the target area the offender has selected from the set of alternative areas.""
  - ""the alternatives represent the 142 different four-digit postal code areas of the study region, the greater The Hague area in the Netherlands.""
  - ""Information on offenders and their offenses was obtained from the Dutch Suspect Identification System (in Dutch ""Herkenningsdienstsysteem [HKS]"") used by The Hague Police Service.""

  - ""The models in which the time-specific effects for previously targeted areas were taken into account (models 1-4, Tables 2 and 3 ) show a pseudo R 2 of .32.""
  - ""the main finding of our study emphasizes that the understudied role of time of day and part of week in crime location choice studies deserves more attention.""
  - ""Extending crime pattern theory by adding a cyclic time dimension to awareness spaces, the present study contributed to the geography of crime literature by stressing that offenders' knowledge about potential risks, rewards, and opportunities could no longer be conceptualized as completely time-invariant.""",,"- The study focuses on the timing of repeat offenders' crime location choices within the week and day, using data from the Netherlands.
- The study uses discrete spatial choice models to analyze 12,639 offenses by 3,666 repeat offenders.
- The dependent variable is the target area chosen by the offender from 142 four-digit postal code areas in The Hague.
- Data sources include the Dutch Suspect Identification System and a nationwide citizen information system.
- Conditional logit models were used to test hypotheses, with results presented using odds ratios and standard errors.
- The study finds that offenders are more likely to return to previously targeted areas at similar times and days.
- The study extends crime pattern theory by incorporating a cyclic time dimension, indicating that offenders' knowledge is time-specific rather than time-invariant."

## KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Results:** Offenders are more likely to commit crimes in areas where they live or have lived.
- **Significant Predictors:** Current and former residential areas, duration and recency of residence.

## DATA QUALITY NOTES
- **Variable Information Quality:** Complete
- **Missing Information:** Some details about spatial unit size and justification for choice not mentioned.
- **Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes.""
  - ""this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in.""
  - ""The first hypothesis to be tested in this study is coined the home hypothesis. It relates the residential history of an offender, including any past residences as well as the present residence, to his or her selection of a crime site.""
  - ""The first data source is a police information system used by the Greater The Hague Police Force that was designed to support crime investigations.""
  - ""The second source of data is the population registration data, which are held in a nationwide information system (Dutch acronym GBA) used by Dutch municipalities and several other agencies, to keep track of birth, death, nationality, marriage, divorce, childbirth, and residential addresses of all Dutch citizens.""
  - ""The third source is a national database of demographic, social, and economic information on all (four-digit) postal code areas in the Netherlands.""
  - ""The purpose of a discrete choice model is to explain the outcome of a discrete choice situation, which is the situation in which an individual decision maker has to choose a single alternative from a limited number of distinct alternatives""
  - ""The first column in table 3 labeled ""Home,"" tests the home hypothesis, which states that offenders are more likely to commit an offense in an area where they live or have lived than in an otherwise comparable area.""
  - ""The next hypothesis to be tested is the history hypothesis. It specifically addresses the role of past residences, stating that offenders are more likely to commit an offense in an area where they currently live than in an area where they formerly lived and are more likely to commit an offense in an area where they formerly lived than in an area where they never lived.""
  - ""The research presented here has addressed an issue that has never been studied systematically-the relative roles of current and former residence in crime-location choice.""
  - ""The findings have demonstrated, as hypothesized, the following:

1. Offenders are more likely to commit an offense in an area where they live or have lived than in an otherwise comparable area.""
  - ""The confirmation of all hypotheses supports the framework of crime pattern theory, a theory that asserts that a crime takes place where a motivated offender's awareness space intersects with suitable targets.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=21 table_on_page=1>```markdown

- **Missing Information:** Some details about spatial units and variable lists are not mentioned.
- **Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Objectives: Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role.""
  - ""We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument.""
  - ""The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second-and third-order neighbourhoods.""
  - ""Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day.""
  - ""Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported.""
  - ""The survey first asked to report on daily and weekly routine activities, categorized in seven different domains: (1) residences, (2) schools, (3) jobs, (4) sports activities, (5) shopping, (6) going out, and (7) any other activities, for which respondents could specify the type of activity themselves.""
  - ""For each of these locations, respondents indicated during which days of the week and times of the day they had usually visited that location in the past year.""
  - ""The dependent variable crime committed in neighbourhood (1 = yes; 0 = no) indicates whether or not an offence was committed in a specific neighbourhood.""
  - ""The independent variable neighbourhood routinely visited (1 = yes; 0 = no) indicates whether or not a neighbourhood was part of the offenders' activity space in the period before or during the crime event.""
  - ""we estimated a conditional logit model as commonly applied in crime location choice research""
  - ""The results of the conditional logit model that tests whether offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different parts of the day are displayed in Table 2""
  - ""The results show that the odds ratio for our main study variable neighbourhood routinely visited at same time of day as crime event is positive and statistically significant (p < 0.001).""
  - ""The odds ratio for neighbourhood routinely visited at different time of day as crime event also does not reach statistical significance (p = 0.324).""
  - ""The results suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day, although the effect size difference was not statistically significant in our small sample-but clearly in the expected direction.""
  - ""the original suspect data from the police included relatively minor offences from offenders with relatively short offence histories.""
  - ""The survey could only be started after digitally signing the informed consent form.""
  - ""The invitation letters were sent in several batches from May to July 2019.""
  - ""When the survey was taken offline at the end of August 2019, a total of 501 respondents had started with the survey (42 letters were returned as undeliverable; response rate 13.4%) 3 and reported about 1990 different activity nodes.""
  - ""363 respondents had fully completed the survey, of which 30 respondents reported having committed at least 1 crime in the year prior to the survey.""
  - ""In total, they reported on 71 unique crimes.""",,"- The study extends crime pattern theory by incorporating time-specificity, focusing on how offenders' spatial knowledge varies by time of day.
- The study uses a discrete spatial choice model to analyze data from 71 offences committed by 30 offenders in the Netherlands.
- The results indicate that almost 40% of offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second-, and third-order neighbourhoods.
- The study finds that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day, although this effect is not statistically significant due to the small sample size.
- The study uses a conditional logit model to test hypotheses about time-specific activity spaces.
- The survey collected detailed information on routine activities and crime locations, with respondents indicating times of day and days of the week for these activities.
- The study's findings provide tentative support for the extended theory, but the authors emphasize the need for replication with larger samples."

- The study divides offenders into three age groups: juvenile, young adult, and adult.
- The study finds that offenders prefer areas frequented by their age group, close to their residence, and with low social cohesion.
- Cybercafés and transportation hubs have different effects on different age groups.
- Schools affect all age groups but with a marginal age decay effect.
- The distance of journey to crime is a significant negative factor, especially for younger offenders.
- The study uses a conditional logit model with a pseudo R² value indicating good explanatory ability.
- Control variables like bus stops and malls have significant impacts, while car parks do not.

  - ""Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders' pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members' home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand.""
  - ""Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge-where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities-and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities.""
  - ""The study illustrates both the opportunities and challenges involved in employing this methodological paradigm with police administrative data.""
  - ""we used discrete spatial choice modeling with a large dataset of policerecorded crimes and activity locations.""
  - ""the alternatives are the neighborhoods (""Statistical Area 2"" Census Units, or ""SA2s"") from which offenders are selecting when deciding where to commit crime.""
  - ""The outcome variable reflects each offender's choice of crime location: in which of the 2,153 SA2s the reference offense was committed.""
  - ""The theoretical model we tested is universal to all crime, so we analyzed a range of crime types varying in target (premises versus people) and motivation (acquiring property versus sexual violence).""
  - ""The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""The general pattern of results-supporting H1(a) to (c)-was that offenders were more likely to commit crime near to activity nodes that were high on both reliability and relevance, lower in proximity to activity nodes that were high on only reliability or relevance and lowest in proximity to activity nodes that were low on both reliability and relevance.""
  - ""the findings demonstrate the salience of a broad range of activity locations to offenders' crime location choices.""
  - ""The present findings build on prior studies that employed DSCMs to study individual reliability and relevance variables in isolation (e.g., Bernasco, 2019;Ruiter, 2017;van Sleeuwen et al., 2021), by demonstrating how these variables operate collectively.""
  - ""The pattern of declining likelihood of crime with increasing distance-clearest for the high reliability/high relevance activity locations-is also consistent with previous studies (Bernasco, 2019;Bernasco & Block, 2009;Kuralarasan & Bernasco, 2021;Menting et al., 2020).""
  - ""the opportunity variables were also associated with crime location choice when controlling for the presence and attributes of offenders' activity locations is also consistent with previous literature.""

- The spatial unit of analysis is communities (juweihui or cunweihui), with an average size of 0.958km² and an average population of 5,957.
- The study uses various data sources, including police arrest records, mobile phone mobility data, street view images, and census data.
- The study measures physical disorder using street view images and constructs neighborhood concentrated disadvantage based on seven conditions.
- The findings include that the likelihood of a community being targeted for burglary decreases with distance from the burglar's home, and more populated communities are more likely to be targeted.
- The presence of newer buildings and transportation facilities like subway stations increases burglary risk.
- Spatial knowledge moderates the relationship between social contexts and physical disorder, particularly in areas different from the residential space."

**Extraction Confidence:** Medium","  - ""Understanding the relationships between individual offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies.""
  - ""Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand.""
  - ""Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations).""
  - ""The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour.""
  - ""The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.""
  - ""The outcome variable reflects the location choice for each offender; from their set of potential SA2s, it is the one in which their reference offence was committed.""
  - ""As predicted by hypothesis 1, offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to activity nodes than farther away.""
  - ""Offenders were between 1.22 times (victim/ witness node + non-residential burglary) and 235 times (home node + sex offence) more likely to offend in an SA2 containing that type of activity node than if the nearest activity node of that type were more than 5 km away.""
  - ""crime opportunity was positively associated with crime location choice, when controlling for the presence of activity nodes.""
  - ""This study aimed to identify near which of a range of activity locations (nodes) recorded in police data offenders are more likely to commit crime.""
  - ""Almost all nodes-including those not considered separately in previous studies: intimate partner and other relatives' homes, school, work, police involved incidents and other police contacts-were significantly and positively associated with crime location choice, at least at short distances.""
  - ""The lack of association between work nodes and residential burglary could reflect a lack of residential burglary opportunities around work nodes likely concentrated in non-residential areas.""
  - ""The lack of association between prior victim/witness events and commercial robbery indicates that these events were not conducive to the acquisition of knowledge of commercial robbery opportunities.""
  - ""The few negative associations-at longer distances-were marginally significant and small.""
  - ""Consistent with our expectations based on crime pattern theory (Brantingham and Brantingham 1991, 1993a) , crime was almost always most likely in the immediate vicinity of activity nodes, declining monotonically with distance.""
  - ""Home and prior crimes showed the strongest associations with crime location choice, over longer distances, followed by homes of immediate family.""
  - ""The apparent wider awareness space around home nodes likely reflects that home nodes tend to anchor other routine activity locations that might not appear in the data""
  - ""The patterns of distance decay for different activity nodes evidence the extent of offenders' awareness space around different activity nodes and the likelihood that they will identify criminal opportunities within that space.""
  - ""Differences in relative associations between crime locations and different nodes were largely consistent with the hypotheses derived from Curtis-Ham et al.'s (2020) theoretical model, thus lending further empirical support to this extension of crime pattern theory.""
  - ""Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to activity nodes that were higher frequency (home versus family homes; immediate family versus other relatives); likely to impart more relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations); and of the same location type as the crime target (home for residential burglary versus non-residential burglary and commercial robbery).""",,"- The paper's title and authors are clearly stated in the document, which is essential for the study identification section.

  - ""Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves.""
  - ""The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out.""
  - ""Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders.""
  - ""The model is estimated using a unique set of data on cleared robbery cases in Chicago and the offenders involved in them, on the communities where the offenders reside, and on those where they attack their victims.""
  - ""The estimation of discrete choice models requires a considerable amount of computer resources when both the number of observations (choices) and the number of alternatives per choice are large.""
  - ""We model the spatial choices of Chicago robbers using a general microeconomic framework for the analysis of discrete choice, that is, choice among a limited set of alternatives.""
  - ""The point of departure is an actor who is faced with a choice among several discrete spatial alternatives, of which he must choose only one.""
  - ""The spatial unit of analysis is a census tract, so that in the model, each robber has a choice among the 844 census tracts of Chicago included in the analysis.""
  - ""The data include the time and place of the incident and some basic characteristics of the offender, including age, sex, and ethnic origin.""

- The primary crime type analyzed is robbery.
- The spatial unit of analysis is the census tract, with 844 tracts included in the analysis.
- The study uses a discrete choice model to analyze the spatial choices of robbers, specifically a conditional logit model.
- Data sources include the U.S. Census Bureau for population and racial/ethnic composition, Chicago Police Department for drug and prostitution arrests, Chicago Public Schools for high school presence, and Claritas for retail employment data.
- The study examines various factors influencing robbery location choice, including distance, racial and ethnic segregation, gang territoriality, presence of illegal markets, and collective efficacy.
- The study finds that proximity to the offender's home, racial and ethnic similarity, and the presence of crime attractors like drug markets and retail activities increase the likelihood of a tract being chosen for robbery.
- Collective efficacy is found to have a deterrent effect on robbery, although the effect is small.
- The study uses a sample size of 6,000 robberies for the final testing."

  - ""We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection.""
  - ""Conclusions Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars' target choices.""
  - ""Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof.""
  - ""This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.""
  - ""The major contribution of our research is that it investigates burglary target choice at the appropriate level of aggregation-burglars burglarize homes rather than complete neighborhoods-while still considering neighborhood-level attributes that affect these choices and taking into account the home locations of the burglars themselves and their limited action radius.""
  - ""The remainder of this article is structured as follows. The next section reviews prior empirical research on burglars' spatial decision-making.""
  - ""In this section, we articulate our research hypotheses. For each hypothesis, we briefly discuss the theoretical grounds.""
  - ""Our first hypothesis relates to the perceived rewards of the burglary.""
  - ""Hypothesis 1 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in more affluent neighborhoods over residences in poorer neighborhoods.""
  - ""Hypothesis 2 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with a higher target density over residences in neighborhoods with a lower target density.""
  - ""Hypothesis 3 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with higher ethnic heterogeneity over residences in neighborhoods with lower ethnic heterogeneity.""
  - ""Hypothesis 4 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with higher proportions of rental units over residences in neighborhoods with lower proportions of rental units.""
  - ""Hypothesis 5 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods where they previously committed burglaries over residences in neighborhoods where they did never before commit burglaries.""
  - ""Hypothesis 6 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in a detached building or in a semidetached building over residences in a terraced building or apartment complex.""
  - ""Hypothesis 7 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences with fewer occupants over residences with more occupants.""
  - ""Hypothesis 9 Burglars prefer burglarizing renter-occupied residences over owner-occupied residences.""
  - ""Hypothesis 10 Burglars prefer burglarizing residences closer to their home over residences further away from their home.""
  - ""Hypothesis 11 The relationships between residential attributes and burglars' preference for burglarizing a residence vary according to neighborhood-level attributes, whereby the effects of positively valued residential attributes strengthen the effects of positively valued neighborhood attributes.""
  - ""In this analysis, we assess the extent to which neighborhood attributes and residence attributes determine the target selection of burglars.""
  - ""To be included in the analysis and in line with previous crime location choice studies (Frith et al. 2017;Townsley et al. 2015), we apply six selection criteria to burglaries and burglars:""
  - ""Applying the six criteria leads to the selection of 679 burglaries that involved 577 unique burglars and 633 unique target residences.""
  - ""To assess the role of the offenders' home locations and the locations of any previous burglaries they committed, the analysis must include only cleared burglaries.""
  - ""Consistent with the existing crime location choice literature (e.g., Bernasco et al. 2016;Frith et al. 2017), we require that at least one of the burglars involved in a burglary must reside in Ghent is.""
  - ""We estimate three main effects models to determine the effects of neighborhood and residence attributes on target choice.""
  - ""In addition, we estimate 25 cross-level interaction effect models to determine to which extent the relationships between residential attributes and the likelihood of burglary target selection vary according to neighborhood-level attributes.""
  - ""The integrated main effects and the interaction effects models are most relevant for our argument.""
  - ""Table 3 displays estimated odds ratios (OR) and standard errors (SE) as well as the Akaike (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess relative model fit for the integrated main effects only model.""
  - ""First, we assess relative model fit for the main effects only models (see Table 3 and Appendix Table 6""
  - ""The smallest AIC and BIC values are observed for the integrated main effects model.""
  - ""We begin by evaluating the role of neighborhood attributes in burglars' target selection process.""
  - ""As shown in Table 3 , residential density and prior burglary activity in the same neighborhood are significantly related to the likelihood of a residence being burglarized, while median income, proportion non-Belgians, and proportion rental units are not.""
  - ""Three out of four residential features are significantly associated with burglary target selection.""
  - ""Building construction type, number of residential units, and rental status are significantly related to burglary target selection.""
  - ""In contrast, number of occupants does not significantly impact burglary target selection.""
  - ""Finally, with respect to distance our results confirm that burglars have a preference for burglarizing residences nearby their home address, a finding that has been demonstrated repeatedly in prior research (Ruiter 2017).""
  - ""Up to distances of around 3 km, burglars prefer residences in poorer over more affluent neighborhoods, but their preference reverses beyond 3 km.""
  - ""Out of 25 possible combinations of neighborhood and residence attributes, 14 significantly predict burglary target choice and lead to slightly different and more nuanced appraisals of target suitability""
  - ""By stating that the three most important aspects of real estate are ""location, location, and location"", many real estate advisors warn prospective buyers against a myopic focus on the individual property and urge them to carefully consider the property's surroundings.""
  - ""Based on the analysis of 679 cleared burglaries committed by 577 burglars, our findings demonstrate that residential burglars adhere to this advice as well.""
  - ""Their choice of targets appears to be informed by both house attributes and neighborhood attributes, and the evaluation of house attributes varies in relation to their neighborhood context.""
  - ""Our results carry implications for theory and research on offender spatial decision-making.""
  - ""In particular, the results of our study are important for how we should think about burglary target selection and, more generally, offender spatial decision-making.""
  - ""First, our analysis offers support for the rational choice perspective's hypothesis that burglars rely on information with regard to environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a suitable target.""
  - ""Second, the adopted model of target selection is not burglary specific.""
  - ""Our study opens up at least two avenues for future research.""
  - ""First, given the well-corroborated finding that burglary risk of a residence is heightened in the wake of a previous burglary (Ellingworth et al. 1995;Farrell and Pease 2001;Polvi et al. 1991), repeated victimization could be reflected in repeated targeting of the same residence by the same offenders.""
  - ""Second, future research could consider short-distance spatial spillover mechanisms in greater detail.""
  - ""In discussing the suggestions for future research, we have also touched upon the implications of our study results for crime prevention practice and crime control policy.""
  - ""If burglary victims protect themselves and improve household security after having been victimized, offenders who return to the same property may find the place better protected and target a nearby property instead.""
  - ""Ultimately, this may render preventative action collectively fruitless.""
  - ""At a practical level, this implies that preventative measures implemented in the wake of a burglary should neither be restricted to the recently targeted residence nor should they be taken in isolation of the neighborhood.""
  - ""Our finding that burglary risk is affected by both residence-level and neighborhood-level attributes underlines this, since it suggests that burglary prevention is optimized by a combination of private and collective efforts.""",,"- The study examines the effects of neighborhood and house attributes on burglars' target selection, using a discrete spatial choice approach.

- The study uses a discrete choice model to analyze how offenders choose locations for their crimes, considering factors like distance from home, accessibility via the street network, and social cohesion.
- The study area is defined by the UK census Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs), which are used as the spatial units of analysis.
- The data covers a 5-year period from 2001 to 2005 and includes 721 crimes committed by 263 offenders.
- The study tests predictions from crime pattern and social disorganization theories, finding that offenders prefer areas with low social cohesion and closer to their homes or routine activity nodes.
- Adult offenders are influenced by the accessibility of neighborhoods via the street network, while younger offenders prefer areas further from city centers.
- The study provides insights into how urban planning can influence crime patterns by considering the placement of routine activity nodes and connectivity."

  - ""Findings provide support for the influence of certain activity nodes and pedestrian-oriented street connectivity in explaining group crime.""
  - ""The current study extends crime pattern theory and addresses this gap in the co-offending literature by considering whether the distribution of co-offences across census block groups in Baltimore City (Maryland) is related to measures of activity nodes and 'connected' street networks, net of the solo crime rate.""
  - ""The data used in this study cover arrests from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 that had complete information on the variables of interest (N = 68,393).1""

  - ""The EPA has a publicly available Smart Location Database that includes a wide range of contextual information about census block groups across the entire United States.""
  - ""The outcome of interest in this study is the rate of group crime events in a given census block group.""
  - ""We estimated the overall solo crime rate per 100 people within a census block group by totalling the number of solo crime incidents, dividing it by the total population, and multiplying it by 100 to provide a standardized rate.""
  - ""We conduct a series of spatially lagged negative binomial regression models to analyze our data because the total count of group crime incidents exhibits over-dispersion""
  - ""For all models, we included the population within the census block group as an exposure measure and this estimates the outcome as a group crime rate per capita""
  - ""The average census block group in Baltimore has 2.4 census blocks, is .14 square miles, and has an average of 953 residents.""
  - ""Data on specific activity nodes (i.e., bars, schools, transit) were provided by publicly available geo-coded data from the Baltimore City Open Data Portal.""
  - ""Data on shopping centres were not included in the data portal, so these were geocoded using Google Map search capabilities.""
  - ""to account for several other contextual covariates (i.e., population, ethnic heterogeneity, population turnover, poverty) related to criminal offending at the macro-level, data from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau was used (U.S. Census Bureau 2016).""
  - ""Group crime events made up a total of 9% (N = 6,279) of all incidents between 2013 and 2016 and included of 20.8% (N = 14,222) of arrested individuals.""
  - ""During this time period, there were a total of N = 6,249 incidents across 653 census block groups (Average Rate = 1.93 per 100 residents, SD = 11.24).""
  - ""The only significant activity node that predicts the rate of group crime is the number of bars.""
  - ""For every additional bar in a census block group, the rate of group crime is expected to increase by about 5.2% (p < .05).""
  - ""Percent poverty in a census block group is also statically significant and positively predicts the rate of group crime (p < .001).""
  - ""the coefficient for pedestrian-oriented street density of census block groups in Baltimore City is statistically significant and positively related to the rate of group crime.""
  - ""For every one-unit increase in the pedestrian-oriented street density of census block groups in Baltimore City there is a 2.8% increase in the rate of group crime (p < .001).""
  - ""Census block groups with higher levels of poverty continue to demonstrate statistically significant increases in the rate of group (p < .001).""
  - ""In contrast, census block groups with higher levels of racial/ethnic heterogeneity report statistically significant reductions in the rate of group crime.""
  - ""The fact that only pedestrian-oriented (as opposed to auto-oriented) street connectivity significantly predicted rates of group crime across the census block groups provides preliminary evidence for the type of connectivity that may facilitate group behaviour.""
  - ""Pedestrian-oriented street density also remains a significant predictor of the rate of group crime.""
  - ""For every one-unit increase in pedestrian-oriented street density, there is a 2% increase in the rate of group crime (p < .001).""
  - ""Consistent with each of the prior models, higher percentages of poverty across census block groups are associated with higher rates of group crime.""

**Variable Information Quality:** Complete
**Missing Information:** None noted
**Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Using data on residential burglaries and residential burglars in The Hague, this study addresses the issue of whether solitary offenders choose their target areas differently from the way offender groups do.""
  - ""The results support the postulated relevance of physical accessibility and proximity to the offenders' homes for both single offenders and co-offending groups.""
  - ""The detection rate for residential burglary in The Hague is 7%.""
  - ""The average neighbourhood has an area of 0.65 square kilometres, is the home to 4952 residents and contains 2380 residential units.""
  - ""The affluence of neighbourhoods is measured by the average value of residential properties in the neighbourhood, the percentage of owner-occupied properties, and the mean income per resident.""
  - ""The physical accessibility of properties in the neighbourhoods is also based on the real estate registration system of the city of The Hague.""
  - ""Ethnographic research could shed some light on this issue, although the presence of non-arrested accomplices or co-offenders seems to be one of the few things that detained and convicted offenders are not very eager to talk about.""
  - ""The outcomes thus partially confirm the general theory on burglary target area choice, but they refute the postulated differences between solitary offenders and group offenders.""
  - ""The own neighbourhood and other nearby neighbourhoods are the most likely targets for burglary, not only for solitary burglars, but for burglar groups as well.""
  - ""The results partially support the hypotheses, because the effects of physical accessibility, proximity, and a special proximity aspect, the home neighbourhood, are all significant in the hypothesised direction,""
  - ""The hypotheses 1, 3, and 5, however, are not supported, as the effects of affluence, social disorganisation, and proximity to the city centre, are not significant.""
  - ""Apparently there is a strong preference for the own neighbourhood as burglary target area.""",,"REASONING:

- The study is focused on residential burglaries in The Hague, Netherlands, and examines whether solitary offenders and co-offending groups choose target areas differently.
- The study uses data from 1996 to 2004, covering all detected residential burglaries in The Hague.
- The spatial unit of analysis is the neighbourhood, with an average size of 0.65 square kilometres.
- The study identifies several criteria for target area selection: affluence, physical accessibility, social disorganisation, proximity to home, and proximity to the city centre.
- The results show that physical accessibility and proximity to the offender's home are significant factors for both solitary and group offenders.
- The study uses a conditional logit model to analyze the data, focusing on the choice of target areas.
- The detection rate for burglaries in The Hague is low at 7%, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.
- The study finds no significant differences between solitary offenders and co-offending groups in terms of target area selection criteria.
- The study uses various data sources, including police records and real estate registration systems, to measure neighbourhood characteristics.
- The study does not find support for the hypothesis that affluent neighbourhoods are more attractive targets for burglars."

**Missing Information:** Not mentioned
**Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted.""
  - ""Using data in 3,337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before.""
  - ""This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent.""
  - ""Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected.""
  - ""In sum, we develop explicit hypotheses on how the time and location of past burglaries affect a burglar's subsequent decisions of where to commit burglaries, and integrate the theory that motivates these into a more general model of burglary location choice.""
  - ""Using police-recorded burglary data we rigorously test three hypotheses using discrete spatial choice modeling techniques.""
  - ""Data were acquired for all detected residential burglaries committed between January 2007 and December 2012 in the West Midlands, a large metropolitan UK police force""
  - ""A residential burglary is the actual or attempted illegal entry into a dwelling with the intent to steal""
  - ""The following variables were available for analysis for each burglary: a unique identifier for the offender involved; the time and date of the burglary; the address and geographic grid coordinates of the burglary (accurate to a resolution of one meter); and spatial coordinates for the home address of the offender at the time of the burglary (also accurate to a resolution of one meter).""
  - ""To prevent a temporal edge effect it was necessary to assure that for each burglary the data would allow us to look back over a fixed period of time to establish the offender's previous burglaries.""
  - ""The data for the remaining observation period (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) were used to analyze their subsequent burglary location choices.""
  - ""The concept of crime location choice presumes spatial units of analysis, which are the alternative locations that burglars choose from when deciding on where to commit a burglary.""
  - ""As a compromise, we decided to use the UK Census Lower Level Super Output Area (LSOA) geography as the basic spatial unit of analysis.""
  - ""LSOAs are defined on the basis of proximity and social homogeneity measures (type of dwelling and nature of tenure) and have a population of approximately 1,500 residents and 600 households.""
  - ""To test the hypotheses, a discrete spatial crime location choice approach is used (Bernasco et al., 2013;Bernasco & Ruiter, 2014) in which every burglary is conceptualized as a discrete choice amongst all 1,687 LSOAs in the study area, and a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relative weight of each of the LSOA characteristics in the burglar's decision.""
  - ""The estimated model parameters (odds ratios, confidence intervals, and significance level indicators) are listed in Table A1 in the Appendix.""
  - ""Pseudo R 2 values for the discrete choice model are expected to be much lower than those for ordinary least squares models. In this case, according to McFadden's guidance, the observed pseudo R 2 of .31 represents an excellent fit to the data""
  - ""Zooming in on what is most relevant for the three hypotheses to be tested here, we first discuss the effects of the times and locations of prior offending.""
  - ""As expected, burglars are more likely to target areas they previously targeted for a burglary than areas they did not target before.""
  - ""The recency of prior burglaries is relevant as well.""
  - ""Not only temporal but also spatial proximity appears to be relevant, as the proposed existence of spatial spillover effects is confirmed.""
  - ""The estimated effects of prior burglaries in the same MSOA also display a pattern of temporal decay,""
  - ""For each category (e.g., '0-2 days' or '3-6 days') in Table 1 , the LSOA estimate is larger than the MSOA estimate, suggesting that having committed a prior burglary in the same LSOA makes a burglar more likely to target the LSOA than just having committed a prior burglary in the same MSOA.""
  - ""As has been demonstrated in all prior discrete spatial choice studies, the distance to the burglar's own residence represents a friction to mobility and has therefore a negative effect:""
  - ""Most but not all of the generic LSOA attributes (i.e. those that are measured without reference to the home location or the prior burglary locations of individual burglars) have statistically significant effects.""
  - ""The distance to the city center has a positive effect on the odds of the LSOA to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""the total number of households, the average house price, the ethnic diversity and the population turnover all increase the odds of an LSOA being chosen as a target area for burglary.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=25 table_on_page=1>```markdown

- The study uses a discrete spatial choice approach to estimate the impact of environmental and offender-level factors on burglary location choices.
- Data were collected from three cities: The Hague (Netherlands), Birmingham (United Kingdom), and Brisbane (Australia).
- The spatial unit of analysis varies by region: neighborhoods in the Netherlands, Super Output Areas in the UK, and Statistical Local Areas in Australia.
- The study uses a conditional logit model to analyze the data, employing maximum likelihood estimation.
- Variables include residential real estate value, residential mobility, proportion of single-family dwellings, proximity to offender's home, proximity to city center, and number of residential units.
- The study finds that proximity to an offender's home, the proportion of single-family dwellings, and the number of residential units are consistent predictors of burglary location choice across all regions.
- The study period varies by region: 1996–2001 for The Hague, 2009 for Birmingham, and 2006 for Brisbane."

- **Missing Information:** Some variable details and data sources not specified
- **Extraction Confidence:** Medium","  - ""Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research.""
  - ""Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship.""
  - ""With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level.""
  - ""Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship.""
  - ""As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices.""
  - ""And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk.""
  - ""Our findings also demonstrate that ""taste"" preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.""
  - ""Analyses were conducted for all street segments in the towns of High Wycombe and nearby Beaconsfield and Marlow in Buckinghamshire (U.K.).""
  - ""The study area was defined by identifying the ""built-up areas"" of the three towns and by applying a 1-km buffer around them""
  - ""Data were provided by Thames Valley Police (TVP) for all residential burglaries recorded and officially cleared for the 10-year period 04/01/2004 to 03/31/2014.""
  - ""The resulting data set contained 459 residential burglaries committed by 207 offenders.""
  - ""The configuration of the road network also influences the movement of people going about their everyday activities""
  - ""The graph theory approach is first discussed, and then a detailed description of how the actual metrics were computed is provided.""
  - ""The findings of quantitative research intended to test these two theories are somewhat mixed and can be divided into two branches.""
  - ""The aim of prior research has been to examine the role of the road network on crime, but it has failed to isolate the influence of these two mechanisms.""
  - ""To address these shortcomings, in this article, we make several novel contributions.""
  - ""We use a discrete choice approach (McFadden, 1974), or more accurately an offense location choice approach (Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), to estimate empirically how the opportunities that are targeted by burglars differ from those that are not.""
  - ""Our research differs from previous studies of offender spatial decision-making in two important ways.""
  - ""First, in most previous studies, scholars have examined offender location choice at the area level (for the exceptions, see Bernasco, 2010b, and Vandeviver et al., 2015).""
  - ""Second, we build on previous work (Davies and Johnson, 2015) and introduce to the discrete choice literature a methodological approach that aims to estimate independently how the road network influences offender awareness of crime opportunities, on the one hand, and guardian potential at particular locations, on the other.""
  - ""By following Townsley, Birks, Ruiter, et al. (2015) , we also recognize that offenders may vary in the extent to which their spatial decision-making is affected by different factors, and so we employ mixed logit statistical models to estimate parameters and how they vary across offenders.""
  - ""The application of the discrete choice framework requires the specification of the decision-makers, the choice-set, and the choice criterion.""
  - ""In studies of crime location choice, the decision-makers are clearly offenders, and the criteria are those factors hypothesized to influence targeting decisions.""
  - ""the choice-set employed by research teams in previous studies has typically been a spatially aggregated grouping, such as census tracts.""
  - ""For example, people do not navigate from one large area to another; they navigate along the road network.""
  - ""As such, a spatial resolution at this scale (e.g., street segment) should better capture the spatial logic of offender decision-making""
  - ""The use of the mixed logit model also shows considerable promise, providing insight into variation in individual taste preferences across offenders that is not possible to detect with conditional logit variants.""
  - ""In summary, in the current study, we used graph theory metrics and a mixed logit approach to test theories of criminal location choice for the crime of burglary.""","  - ""(Page 25, Table 1) | Variable                                                                 |    1   |    2   |    3   |    4   |    5   |    6   |    7   |    8   |    9   |   10   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1.

- The study uses a conditional logistic regression to identify characteristics that increase the likelihood of an area being selected as a target.
- The study area is Belfast, Northern Ireland, with a focus on attacks carried out over a twenty-year period.
- The spatial unit of analysis is ""small areas"" in Belfast, which are used to evaluate the expected utility of each potential target area.
- The study considers three primary criteria for target selection: distance, natural barriers, and ideology.
- The findings indicate that distance from the terrorist's home decreases the likelihood of an area being chosen, while the presence of major roads, police stations, or military bases increases this likelihood.
- The study uses a discrete spatial choice approach to model the selection process based on utility.
- The model fit is satisfactory with a McFadden pseudo-R² value of 0.178, and three parameters significantly contribute to the model's predictive capacity.
- The results are supported by statistical tests, including a likelihood-ratio test."

**Missing Information:** Not mentioned
**Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week.""
  - ""The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week.""
  - ""The spatial units of analysis are census blocks.""
  - ""Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.""
  - ""The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week.""
  - ""The present article seeks to contribute to the knowledge about how spatial crime patterns depend on the time of the day and the day of the week.""
  - ""Using data on the city of Chicago, we answer the question whether street robbers' crime location preferences vary across the hours of the day and across the days of the week.""
  - ""The analysis is limited to cleared robberies because only for cleared robberies offender addresses are available, and distance from the offender home location is by far the most important predictive factor in crime location choice""
  - ""The recorded information on robberies includes the date, the time, the number of arrested offenders involved, and the nearest address to where the robbery was committed.""
  - ""About 98.5 percent of these addresses were successfully geocoded and assigned to 1 of the 24,594 census blocks in the city of Chicago.""
  - ""The data also include information on the offenders who were arrested for committing these street robberies, including gender, racial and ethnic background, age, and residential address at the time of the robbery.""
  - ""The mean age was 23.9 years (SD ¼ 8.8), 89.7 percent were male, 78.4 percent were African American, 15.6 percent were Hispanic, and 5.5 percent were White.""
  - ""In addition, we collected detailed information on land use, population, and activities in all 24,594 census blocks of the city of Chicago in the year 2000.""
  - ""The blocks had a median size of 19,680 m 2 (approximately 140 Â 140 m), and there were 5,867 blocks without a residential function.""
  - ""To measure small-scale retail activities in the block, we used marketing information collected by Claritas (now part of marketing research firm Nielsen) on businesses in the city of Chicago during the same period the crime data were recorded.""
  - ""To measure the local presence of illegal retail activities, in particular drugs dealing, prostitution, and illegal gambling, geocoded incident files of the Chicago Police Department of the years 1996 to 1998 were aggregated to the census block level.""
  - ""The accessibility of a block was measured by two indicator variables, namely, (13) whether the block is located along at least one main street (rather than only minor streets) and ( 14) whether the block contains a station of the El, the Chicago elevated railway system (also known as ""L"").""
  - ""Data on (15) the presence of private and public high schools in a census block were based on lists compiled by the Chicago Public Schools.""
  - ""Data on block population was obtained from the U.S. 2000 Census.""
  - ""The information on the racial and ethnic composition was combined with the racial/ethnic background of the offender to create a dummy variable which indicates whether the majority of the census block population was of the same racial/ethnic background (African American, Hispanic, or White) as the offender.""
  - ""Euclidian distances were calculated between the homes of the offenders and the midpoints of each of the 24,594 census blocks.""
  - ""The distances between offender homes and robbery locations within their own census block of residence was approximated by half the square root of the census block surface, which is about the average distance between two random points in a rectangle of the same size as the block surface""
  - ""The home-crime distance follows a typical distance decay distribution with a long tail, indicating that the majority of home-crime trips were short and very few were long.""
  - ""In line with prior crime location choice studies (e.g., Baudains et al. 2013;Bernasco and Block 2009;Bernasco and Kooistra 2010;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta 2005;Clare et al. 2009;Johnson and Summers 2015;Townsley et al. 2015;Vandeviver et al. 2015), the conditional logit model was used to estimate the effects of census block attributes on the probability of the census block being selected for robbery.""
  - ""To explore temporal differences in location preference, 12 models were estimated separately for each of 12 two-hour blocks (4-6 a.m., 6-8 a.m., 8-10 a.m., etc.) and 7 models were estimated separately for each of the seven days of the week.""
  - ""The choice for two-hour blocks seemed like a reasonable compromise between the need to use a fine-grained temporal measure on the one hand, and the need for statistical power in modeling and efficiency in presenting results on the other hand.""
  - ""The findings thus confirm that street robbers prefer to attack near cash-intensive businesses and other places that seem to promise high benefits and low risks.""
  - ""High schools are a notable exception, as they appear to be only attractive places for robbery around school hours but not in evenings and nights nor during weekends.""",,"- The study examines the hypothesis that street robbery location choices vary by time of day and day of the week, using discrete location choice models.
- The spatial units of analysis are census blocks, which are described in terms of their attributes such as legal and illegal cash economies, high schools, accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.
- The study uses data from the Chicago Police Department and other sources to analyze street robberies in Chicago.
- The methodology involves estimating separate models for each two-hour time block and each day of the week to assess temporal differences in location preferences.
- The study includes a range of variables such as demographic, economic, land use, infrastructure, distance/accessibility, crime opportunity, social/behavioral, environmental, and temporal/control variables.
- The findings indicate that most location attributes do not significantly vary by time of day or day of the week, except for high schools which are more attractive during school hours."

- The study uses data from 369 solved cases and relates them to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan.
- The results highlight that residential burglars are attracted to areas near their residence, with many past residential burglaries, many residential units, and a higher proportion of single-family dwellings.
- The study aims to determine if past crime data can be used as an index of neighborhood attractiveness for residential burglary.
- The study uses past crime data from 2004 to 2006 and calculates the number of past residential burglaries and the past residential burglary rate.
- The findings indicate that distance from the offender's residence has a negative effect, while the number of residential units, proportion of single-family dwellings, number of past residential burglaries, and past residential burglary rate have positive effects.
- The distance from the offender's residence has the largest impact, followed by the number of past residential burglaries.
- The past residential burglary rate is an independent variable with a positive effect.
- The proportion of foreigners and newcomers had no significant impact on crime location choice.
- The study area includes only residential units, as non-residential units are not targets for residential burglary.
- Data sources include the Japanese national police register and the 2010 Japanese national census.
- The study concludes that past crime data significantly impact crime location choice and are effective for indexing neighborhood attractiveness."

## DATA QUALITY NOTES
**Variable Information Quality:** Complete
**Missing Information:** None noted
**Extraction Confidence:** High","  - ""Methods: Collecting fresh, micro-level data using Google Street View (GSV) as a tool of Systematic Social Observation (SSO), we utilise a case-control design to isolate property-level effects.""
  - ""Results: The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""Conclusions: Burglary target selection does not stop at the selection of a target neighbourhood, but certain characteristics of individual properties within the same neighbourhood are in turn indicative of burglary risk.""
  - ""For this study, a selection of 150 dwellings that were burglarised during daylight hours in 2009 is made from geocoded, timestamped data from The Hague Police Force, the Netherlands.""
  - ""The physical characteristics of these residential units and their immediate surrounding area are measured through Systematic Social Observation (SSO), using Google Maps and its built-in virtual reality tool, Google Street View (GSV).2""
  - ""The outcome variable in this study was whether or not a residential unit was burgled in The Hague during the year 2009.""
  - ""The explanatory variables on the property-level were primarily collected based a variety of GSV images, which allows users to 'move' up and down the street to get different angles of the property, including nearby streets from which the unit is visible.""
  - ""Property surveillability was measured by three items, namely (1) the number of windows from neighbouring residential units with a direct view of the front ground floor, (2) the distance between the property and the building on the other side of the street, and (3) the visibility of the front door from the street.""
  - ""Property accessibility was measured through seven items, namely (1) whether the property was at the end of a row of properties, (2) number of boundaries the property shared with public areas, (3) whether the private space of the property could be sealed off with physical barriers, (4) whether the property has a burglar alarm, (5) whether the property was setback from the street, (6) the age of the building and ( 7) whether the property had amenities, such as plant pots and benches, on public space directly outside the unit.""
  - ""Wealth was measured with three items, namely (1) whether the property had a garage, (2) the size of the property in square metres, and (3) the external condition of the property.""
  - ""Ease of escape was measured with three items, namely (1) the distance between the property and the nearest main road, (2) the distance between the property and the nearest street corner, and (3) the number of escape routes, including footpaths, leading off the street segment.""
  - ""Three variables were used as control variables. One binary variable indicated whether there was a business present in the immediate surrounding area open during daylight hours: we aimed to control for the 'eyes on the street' that nearby businesses might generate.""
  - ""The findings lead us to reject the null hypotheses of no effect for hypotheses H1, H2 and H4. For H3, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between indications of resident wealth and the risk of being burgled.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=6 table_on_page=1>```markdown
