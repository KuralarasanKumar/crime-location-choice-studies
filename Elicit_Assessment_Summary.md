## 🎯 **PRIORITY INFORMATION STILL NEEDED**

### **1. Variable Categorization** ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Status:** You have variable lists but need categorization
**What to extract:**
```
For each study, categorize the variables into:
- Demographic variables: [count]
- Economic variables: [count]
- Land use variables: [count]
- Infrastructure variables: [count]
- Distance variables: [count]
- Crime opportunity variables: [count]
- Social variables: [count]
- Total variables: [count]
```

### **2. Study Area Sizes in km²** ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Status:** You have descriptions, need numeric values
**What to extract:**
```
Convert text descriptions to numeric km²:
- "Greater London" → ~1,572 km²
- "Entire city of Perth" → ~5,386 km²
- "Inner city areas" → [specific size]
```

### **3. Sampling Strategy Clarification** ⭐ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Status:** Our automation shows 32 studies need clarification
**What to extract:**
```
For studies where sampling is unclear, specify:
- Full choice set (no sampling)
- Random sampling
- Stratified sampling  
- Importance sampling
- Other sampling method
```

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Option A: Minimal Additional Work (Recommended)**
**Time:** ~2-3 hours
**Focus:** Extract only the most critical missing pieces

1. **Variable categorization** for 10-15 representative studies
2. **Study area sizes** for studies with unclear descriptions
3. **Run analysis** with current data (already very comprehensive!)

### **Option B: Complete Extraction**
**Time:** ~6-8 hours  
**Focus:** Perfect completeness

1. **Variable categorization** for all 49 studies
2. **Study area sizes** for all studies
3. **Sampling clarification** for unclear cases
4. **Scale justification details**
5. **Model performance metrics**

## 💡 **SPECIFIC ELICIT PROMPTS FOR REMAINING NEEDS**

### **For Variable Categorization:**
```
For this study, categorize each independent variable:

Demographic variables (population, age, household size): [list and count]
Economic variables (income, unemployment, property values): [list and count]
Land use variables (commercial, residential, mixed use): [list and count]
Infrastructure variables (roads, transit, lighting): [list and count]
Distance variables (to city center, highways, amenities): [list and count]
Crime opportunity variables (previous crimes, guardianship): [list and count]
Social variables (cohesion, disorder, diversity): [list and count]

Total independent variables: [count]
```

### **For Study Area Sizes:**
```
What is the total study area size in km²?

Look for:
- Explicit size mentions ("150 km²", "5,386 square kilometers")
- City/region names that can be converted to area
- Map scales or descriptions that indicate size
- Administrative boundary descriptions

If not directly stated, provide best estimate or description.

## 📈 **YOUR CURRENT ACHIEVEMENT**

🏆 **90-95% Complete!** You have successfully extracted the vast majority of information needed for a comprehensive SUoA analysis.

**What you've accomplished:**
- ✅ All critical information for 5/6 research questions
- ✅ High-quality extraction of hard-to-automate information
- ✅ Complete methodological information
- ✅ Rich contextual data (population, data sources, study areas)

**Remaining work:**
- 🔹 Variable categorization (most important)
- 🔹 Numeric study area sizes (helpful but not critical)
- 🔹 Sampling clarification (nice to have)
