AB  - Background: The simplicity of synthesis methods has facilitated the illegal manufacture of various fentanyl analogs, leading to numerous fatal overdoses worldwide, particularly in North America. Fentanyl analogs with similar structures are difficult to distinguish due to their fragmentation patterns, making separation using chromatography essential. Additionally, because fentanyl analogs are lethal even in trace amounts, they are easily smuggled, and commonly used fentanyl test strips often fail to detect them due to their low sensitivity. Therefore, the urgent need for analytical methods that can simultaneously identify multiple analogs and swiftly detect them at low concentrations. Results: In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was conducted to screen 93 types of fentanyl analogs among the illegal fentanyl substances. The phenyl-hexyl columns enhance fentanyl analog separation through strong π–π interactions. The serially coupled column system increased the separation efficiency and mitigated peak distortion, particularly those of polar fentanyl analogs. The selectivity varied significantly, depending on the interactions with the combined columns. The phenyl-hexyl column's superior ability to predict fentanyl analog interactions based on molecular structure was confirmed by retention factor analysis. The resolution of fentanyl isomers increased significantly when methanol was used instead of acetonitrile as an organic modifier in the mobile phase. The approach was validated by determining the limits of detection and quantification, specificity, detection capability, recovery, and relative ion intensity. Significance: The fentanyl analogs, including 23 sets of isomeric and isobaric compounds, were analyzed via separation using a phenyl-hexyl column serially coupled with a cyano column. The serially coupled column system increased the separation efficiency and mitigated peak distortion, particularly those of polar fentanyl analogs. The proposed strategy can be adopted in exploring methods of effectively separating mixtures with diverse properties, aiding the prevention of drug abuse and bolstering public health and safety efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators is a particularly worrying phenomenon given that the severity of psychopathological sequelae for the victims are increased when the sexual offense is committed by more than one offender. Preliminary studies showed that sexual violence committed by solo offenders is different from that of duos or groups of offenders. This study explores the heterogeneity within 983 cases of sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators, with a focus not only on offenders’ modus operandi, but also victims’ routine activities and situational aspects of the crime. Results from a latent class analysis identified four offending patterns: sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators where: 1) stranger victims were randomly selected; 2) offenders were geographically mobile; 3) victims were assaulted during social events; and 4) offenders were non-sexually motivated. Findings help identify situational characteristics interacting with offenders’ behaviors and victims’ routine activities associated with sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators. The implications regarding the heterogeneity of criminal patterns in these forms of violence is discussed in relation to police practice, situational crime prevention strategies, and future research. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The harms of excessive drinking are important issues faced by China and other countries around the world. Previous studies have identified certain relationships between drinking behaviors and environmental factors, with limited consideration of the dynamic geographic context and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of these relationships. This study constructs a theoretical framework for the relationships between excessive drinking and geographical environment factors (i.e., alcohol availability, spatial disorder, and social disorder). Using multisource spatiotemporal data, including the alcoholism cases received by Guangzhou Emergency Medical Command Center and mobile signaling data, the study explores the spatiotemporal patterns and the influencing factors of excessive drinking in a dynamic geographic context. Results show that: (1) Excessive drinking events mostly occur on weekends, at night, and in urban commercial centers. Its spatial distribution is balanced in the daytime but congregated in the nighttime; (2) Excessive drinking is influenced by alcohol availability (positively correlated with the density of KTVs and traffic stations). The positive impact of KTVs is prominent in the old urban area in the daytime and is prominent in more areas in the nighttime. The positive impact of traffic stations is mainly observed at the edge of central urban area and in suburban areas, and is relatively stronger in the daytime; (3) Excessive drinking is also affected by certain spatial disorder factors (positively correlated with the land development level), but has no significant relationship with building age and streetscape messiness. The positive impact of land development level is prominent in the new urban scenic core area and the urban villages at the urban-rural fringe, with a stronger impact in the daytime; (4) The relationship between excessive drinking and social disorder shows greater spatiotemporal differentiation and complexity. Overall, excessive drinking is negatively correlated with the proportion of nonlocal-born population, and positively correlated with the proportion of low-educated population and residential rent; (5) By analyzing different leading factors influencing excessive drinking in the daytime or nighttime, four types of spatial units can be identified, allowing for respective interventions in these zones to reduce the risk of excessive drinking. This study reveals the relationships between excessive drinking and geographical environment in a dynamic geographic context and at a smaller spatial scale, which fills the gap of lacking smaller-scale analysis, spatiotemporal heterogeneity perspective, and consideration of dynamic geographic context in previous studies. Our results provide insights for alcohol policy making, regional security and medical resource allocation, spatial planning, and environmental intervention related to health issues. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Many people are using their mobile or smartphone to store data and allow the user to access the internet and many online services. These situations are causing an intensification of cybercrimes, thus, to improve the security of the password required, the mobile phone came out with an alternative method, by using biometrics technology. This study firstly would be focusing on the implementation of typing patterns known as keystroke technique and secondly to conduct analysis to determine whether it is suitable to be implemented as an authentication technique by training and testing the dataset with several machine learning classifiers. From the seven classification techniques, three suitable classifiers have been identified and the results show that Random Forest with False Accepted Rate (FAR) of 0.2% and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 5.31% had the best performance It can be concluded that keystroke technique has the potential to be a good method to authenticate a user with further research.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

AB  - This study shows that electric cars (EVs) are a viable replacement for conventional combustion-engine vehicles, providing lower carbon emissions and more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. Depite the hype, the challenges like cybersecurity flaws and possible cyberattacks are also emerging in EVs. In addition to jeopardizing user privacy and vehicle safety, a number of issues seriously jeopardize the integrity and security of electric cars (EVs). This research offers a unique machine learning (ML)-based detection and prevention system designed to identify cyber threats in electric vehicles (EVs) in response to these problems. The suggested solution examines Controller Area Network (CAN) traffic data using cutting-edge ML algorithms to find unusual patterns suggestive of cyber threats. The solution improves the cybersecurity resilience of electric vehicles (EVs) by including proactive preventive measures and real-time threat detection capabilities. This ensures vehicle safety and guards against new and existing cyber-attacks. Through thorough evaluation and validation procedures, the efficacy of the suggested system is proven, underscoring its strong performance in identifying and averting cyberattacks in electric vehicles. This research helps to create safer and more secure mobility solutions for electric vehicles by implementing proactive cybersecurity measures and integrating cutting-edge ML technology.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - For passengers using transportation, the expansion of ride-sharing platforms, various types of vehicles, and various riding services has presented new security and safety challenges. Passengers may experience accidents, injuries, harassment, and robbery-related incidents as a result of improper driver and passenger monitoring systems, illegal vehicle registration, careless driving, driver alcohol consumption, and sleep deprivation. To check the safety status of passengers in Bangladesh by examining driver and passenger behavior, aggressive driving, and unusual activity during transport driving, no appropriate ICT-based system or mobile application was available in the existing research. To address the issue of passenger safety, this paper presents an innovative mobile application that allows users to check the status of their transportation safety by analyzing driving patterns, suspicious activity, and the behavior of both drivers and passengers. Additionally, user IDs are verified, and users can select and book a driver by evaluating their availability, experience, cost, rating, post-query functionality, app reviews, and security force contact information regarding questionable travel behavior. Up to 73% of reviewers left positive comments about the app's usefulness and benefits, according to the app's competence and superiority analysis.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Fingermarks are an important form of evidence in forensic science, routinely used for identification or exclusion purposes within the criminal justice system. The increasing use of fingerprint recognition in technology and biosecurity, such as for unlocking devices and accessing banking information, highlights the need for forensic fingermark recovery methods that serve both traditional forensic needs and modern technological demands. Current fingerprint development techniques, however, are not designed to fulfil this dual-purpose. This paper presents a novel approach that introduces the use of conductive paint and silicone to develop, recover, and preserve latent, patent, and plastic fingermarks. The innovative method produces conductive casts that capture detailed ridge patterns, thereby facilitating forensic examination as well as being used for unlocking capacitive and ultrasonic fingerprint scanners in a range of mobile devices. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction Increasing engagement in HIV care among people living with HIV, especially those from Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx communities, is an urgent need. Mobility data that measure individuals' movements over time in combination with sociostructural data (eg, crime, census) can potentially identify barriers and facilitators to HIV care engagement and can enhance public health surveillance and inform interventions. Methods and analysis The proposed work is a longitudinal observational cohort study aiming to enrol 400 Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals living with HIV in areas of the USA with high prevalence rates of HIV. Each participant will be asked to share at least 14 consecutive days of mobility data per month through the study app for 1 year and complete surveys at five time points (baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). The study app will collect Global Positioning System (GPS) data. These GPS data will be merged with other data sets containing information related to HIV care facilities, other healthcare, business and service locations, and sociostructural data. Machine learning and deep learning models will be used for data analysis to identify contextual predictors of HIV care engagement. The study includes interviews with stakeholders to evaluate the implementation and ethical concerns of using mobility data to increase engagement in HIV care. We seek to study the relationship between mobility patterns and HIV care engagement. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine (#20205923). Collected data will be deidentified and securely stored. Dissemination of findings will be done through presentations, posters and research papers while collaborating with other research teams.  © 2023 Author(s). Published by BMJ.

AB  - In latest years, harassment or abuse through mobile devices and the Internet has been on the rise. This issue, better known as cyberbullying, is crueler and more dangerous than the traditional ways of bullying, largely due to the anonymity on social media or the Internet possibly generating consequences across the person’s lifetime. Therefore, different approaches have been developed in the search of alerting, informing, and preventing about cyberbullying situations such as the creation of regulations, issuing laws, or promoting technological approaches. This paper aims to find relevant patterns by applying clustering techniques, and to accomplish this goal, the survey titled the scale of victimization among adolescents through mobile phones and Internet (CYBVIC) has been used allowing to measure behaviors of harassment, aggression and social exclusion. The results obtained by the clustering can be used to combat this social problem due to this analysis highlights the seven most important questions and the hidden patterns among the filled responses. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigates the effect of advertised rewards in credential leaks on the likelihood and speed of account hijacking. Methods: In an online field experiment, we created 176 honey Gmail accounts and randomly assigned them to eight different posts containing account credential leaks. We used a 2 × 2 experimental design, manipulating two key variables within the post titles: the number of accounts (5 K or 1.5 M) and the promise of access to additional platforms (absent or present). We then monitored the accounts for any subsequent activity. Results: Our findings indicate that the promise of access to additional platforms increased the likelihood and speed of an attempted access. Only 12 accounts were fully accessed, however, because most hijackers did not complete the second-factor authentication (2FA) process required for gaining full access. It seems that the 2FA acted as a deterrent to complete Gmail account hijacking. Conclusions: The study aligns with the rational choice perspective of crime, showing that the prospect of greater rewards leads to more attempted account accesses.

AB  - Spatial contagions, such as pandemics, opinion polarization, infodemics and civil unrest, exhibit non-trivial spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics driven by complex human behaviours and population mobility. Here, we propose a concise generic framework to model different contagion types within a suitably defined contagion vulnerability space. This space comprises risk disposition, considered in terms of bounded risk aversion and adaptive responsiveness and a generalized susceptibility acquisition. We show that resultant geospatial contagion configurations follow intricate Turing patterns observed in reaction–diffusion systems. Pattern formation is shown to be highly sensitive to changes in underlying vulnerability parameters. The identified critical regimes (tipping points) imply that slight changes in susceptibility acquisition and perceived local risks can significantly alter the population flow and resultant contagion patterns. We examine several case studies using Australian datasets (COVID-19 pandemic; crime incidence; conflict exposure during COVID-19 protests; real estate businesses and residential building approvals) and demonstrate that these spatial contagions generated Turing patterns in accordance with the proposed model. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Sexual violence is widespread in war-torn North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Timely access to care is crucial for the healing and wellbeing of survivors of sexual violence, but is problematic due to a variety of barriers. Through a better understanding of care-seeking behaviours and factors influencing timely access to care, programmes can be adapted to overcome some of the barriers faced by survivors of sexual violence. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe demographics, care-seeking patterns and factors influencing timely care-seeking by survivors of sexual violence. Methods: Retrospective file-based data analysis of sexual violence survivors accessing care within two Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) programmes supporting the Ministry of Health, in North Kivu, DRC, 2014–2018. Results: Most survivors (66%) sought care at specialised sexual violence clinics and a majority of the survivors were self-referred (51%). Most survivors seeking care (70%) did so within 3 days. Male survivors accessing care were significantly more likely to seek care within 3 days compared to females. All age groups under 50 years old were more likely to seek care within 3 days compared to those aged 50 years and older. Being referred by the community, a family member, mobile clinic or authorities was significantly associated with less probability of seeking care within 3 days compared to being self-referred. Conclusion: Access to timely health care for survivors of sexual violence in North Kivu, DRC, is challenging and varies between different groups of survivors. Providers responding to survivors of sexual violence need to adapt models of care and awareness raising strategies to ensure that programmes are developed to enable timely access to care for all survivors. More research is needed to further understand the barriers and enablers to access timely care for different groups of survivors. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Studies of neighborhood crime are often limited in their ability to account for the dynamic nature of human mobility, a central tenet of prominent theoretical perspectives on the spatial distribution of crime. Yet, recent work indicates the utility of social media data for estimating the size and composition of such ambient population. In the present study, we assess whether four Twitter-derived measures are associated with crime counts across 2,348 block groups. Specifically, we focus on the density of Twitter users (and tweets), as well as the proportion of Twitter users (and tweets) that are “insiders.” We inferred Twitter users’ “insider” location from the block group in which they tweeted most frequently. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic provided an unprecedented environment for studying the impact of lockdowns and mobility restrictions on crime. Focusing on crimes, this study first detected emerging clusters of four types of crime (larceny, auto theft, burglary, and robbery) in Atlanta using space-time permutation scan statistics. We then investigated how the spatiotemporal patterns of these clusters changed during the pandemic (2020) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2019). Finally, we classified the detected clusters based on their duration and radius. Our results show that burglary clusters became shorter and smaller during the pandemic. The average duration and radius of statistically significant burglary clusters were 10.75 days and 0.79 km for 2019, but 6.86 days and 0.45 km for 2020, respectively. In contrast, we observed more larceny clusters that were temporally longer and spatially larger during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The duration and radius of statistically significant larceny clusters were 17.67 days and 0.46 km for 2019 and 23.22 days and 0.75 km for 2020, respectively. Furthermore, we noted a shift in the clusters from residential areas to commercial areas. We however detected a very limited number of auto theft and robbery clusters. Our findings have the potential to help prioritize future police force deployment and resource allocation in similar lockdown environments, such as pandemics or natural disasters. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - The creation of a safety system that is based on GPS and is developed exclusively for the health and safety of women via the incorporation of novel elements in order to meet the rising concerns about crimes committed against women. The gadget is capable of contacting authorities, conveying the user's position via SMS, and generating a loud noise to attract attention. It may be triggered in anticipation of potential danger and can be activated in the event that danger is imminent. In order to guarantee that only authorized users are able to activate the device, the system makes use of fingerprint recognition in a very unique way. Using technologies such as global positioning system (GPS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), and microcontrollers, this study makes a contribution to the continuing efforts to improve the safety of women via technological innovation. It provides a proactive approach to prevent violence against women and save lives. The research emphasizes the significance of combining hardware and software in order to provide a complete safety tool. It also illustrates the vital role that quick support plays and the potential of such gadgets to promote confidence among women in public places.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) networks brings new security challenges for service providers. Due to the resource constrained nature of IoT networks, conventional security methods are not always suitable. Therefore, physical layer security (PLS) has come to the forefront, providing a high level of security while respecting the limited resources of IoTs. A Sybil attack is an insider attack in which a malicious node illegitimately fakes multiple identities, to impersonate legitimate nodes in the IoT network. This study introduces a novel Sybil attack detection scheme for mobile IoT networks that corresponds to time-varying channel. doppler-shift caused by mobile IoT nodes is considered as a novel detection metric to identify available Sybil attacks. The proposed scheme is analyzed by both the true positive rate and the false positive rate, which are mathematically formulated to verify the simulation results. Results demonstrate that as the randomness in the mobility pattern of IoT nodes increases, the proposed detection mechanism based on doppler-shift offers improved identification of the Sybil nodes. Moreover, this work provides receiver operating characteristics (RoCs) for mobile IoT networks to evaluate the effect of different system parameters, including carrier frequency, velocity, subcarrier spacing (SCS), and the size of cyclic prefix (CP). The performance of the proposed scheme improves with an increase in both the carrier frequency and velocity, as the doppler-shift becomes more pronounced.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - We investigate the concept of “criminal failure” in sexual crimes and the relevance of various theoretical frameworks for its understanding: individual offender's rational choice, environmental influences and routine activities, victimological characteristics from lifestyle theory, and crime interaction factors. We examined a sample of 1121 “failed” cases (i.e., attempted but not completed) and 1500 “successful” cases (i.e., completed) of sexual assault that occurred in France between 1990 and 2018. We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime. This understudied area can yield important theoretical knowledge and practical implications regarding the prevention of sexual crimes. © 2024

AB  - Female commuters across the globe face numerous constraints while using public transport (PT) systems. Unfortunately, the gender-specific needs and demands of women are often ignored while designing transportation settings, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, transit fear and victimization have become prevalent in such fragile transport systems. This study aims to shed light on the close association between transit fear, victimization, and the inadequacies of transportation systems. It also explores how these issues have been addressed in academic discourse over time. The study employs a combination of ‘narrative review’ and ‘systematic review’, commonly known as a ‘semi-systematic review’ process. To achieve its objectives, the study reviewed 88 papers, including relevant grey literature for narrative analysis, and conducted different themes and keywords analyses on 116 Scopus-indexed papers for a comprehensive systematic review. However, in the context of developing countries, the Scopus database reveals a scarcity of empirical studies that focus on women’s victimization during transit and gendered transport environment settings. This leads to a significant disparity in recognizing transit victimization, implementing effective mitigation measures, and understanding the patterns of reporting harassment varying substantially between developed and developing nations. While the narrative review provides detailed observations, the bibliometric analysis adds new insights and strengthens the understanding of the narrative review from different perspectives. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Microphone has been widely integrated into mobile devices to provide physical basis for human-device voice interaction. However, the microphone may be spitefully invoked by malicious mobile applications(apps) with arousing security and privacy concerns. In this work, to explore the issue of illegal microphone access, we develop spiteful apps through native and injection development to access the microphone viciously on a series of mobile devices. The results demonstrate that baleful apps could enable the microphone arbitrarily without any hint. To combat the unauthorized microphone access behavior, we design a microphone illegal access detection(MicDet) scheme by constructing a request-response time model using the Unix time stamps of voice icon touched and microphone invoked. Through conducting numerical analysis and hypothesis testing to effectively verify the request-response pattern of app's normal access, we detect illegal access by analyzing whether the touch operation matches the normal pattern. For friendly user experience, we design an intuitive floating window to alert users by displaying the name of the app that illegally accessed the microphone once the illegal behavior is detected. Finally, we apply our scheme to different mobile devices and test several apps, the experimental results show that the MicDet scheme achieves a high detection accuracy.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Illicit drug and alcohol-related activities pose significant challenges to metropolitan centres globally, impacting public safety and socio-economic stability. This research analyzes the spatial and temporal patterns of drugs and alcohol-related illegal activities (DARIA) in Siliguri, known as the “Gateway of North-East India.” The primary objectives are to explore DARIA patterns, identify clusters and concentrated areas, and investigate contributing factors. Using GIS-based spatial analysis and geographical models, we studied incidents recorded over three years from 2021 to 2023. Advanced spatial statistical approaches were applied to identify specific clusters of DARIA occurrences. The pure temporal analysis highlighted periods of increased illegal activity. Various geographical models, including ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), were used to examine the spatial association. The MGWR model, with an explanatory power of R2 = 0.816, provided a detailed understanding of spatial relationships and variations in DARIA. Our findings indicate specific zones with frequent DARIA occurrences, mainly near major transportation hubs, commercial points, and areas with significant mobility. Key exploratory factors such as illiteracy rate, population density, proximity to playgrounds and slums were highly associated with DARIA incidents. These findings contribute to developing safer, more resilient, and more sustainable cities worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using data gathered from mobile devices and suspicious pattern detection algorithms, Mobile Forensic Data Analysis seeks to identify criminals. When criminal activity is associated with robotic processes like malware distribution, it is easy to foresee. When human behavior is involved, as in traditional crimes, prediction and detection become more alluring. Cyberbullying and small-scale drug sales, both of which rely heavily on mobile devices, are the focus of the current study, which proposes a combined criminal profiling and suspicious pattern identification methodology. Our evidence-based method improves accuracy and decreases false positives on a dataset by linking several observed patterns. After evaluating and displaying the results of tests conducted on a dataset that includes both benign and malicious traffic, the scenarios are re-run on a real dataset for further testing and verification. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

AB  - Objectives: Routine activity theory suggests that levels of crime are affected by peoples’ activity patterns. Here, we examine if, through their impact on people’s on- and off-line activities, COVID-19 restriction affected fraud committed on- and off-line during the pandemic. Our expectation was that levels of online offending would closely follow changes to mobility and online activity—with crime increasing as restrictions were imposed (and online activity increased) and declining as they were relaxed. For doorstep fraud, which has a different opportunity structure, our expectation was that the reverse would be true. Method: COVID-19 restrictions systematically disrupted people’s activity patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions well-suited to testing the effects of “interventions” on crime. We exploit those conditions using ARIMA time series models and UK data for online shopping fraud, hacking, doorstep fraud, online sales, and mobility to test hypotheses. Doorstep fraud is modelled as a non-equivalent dependent variable, allowing us to test whether findings were selective and in line with theoretical expectations. Results: After controlling for other factors, levels of crime committed online were positively associated with monthly variation in online activities and negatively associated with monthly variation in mobility. In contrast, and as expected, monthly variation in doorstep fraud was positively associated with changes in mobility. Conclusions: We find evidence consistent with routine activity theory, suggesting that disruptions to people’s daily activity patterns affect levels of crime committed both on- and off-line. The theoretical implications of the findings, and the need to develop a better evidence base about what works to reduce online crime, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Reducing crime is important to maintain social stability and promote people’s well-being. However, the spatial boundaries are often considered places with inadequate regulation, unclear allocation of responsibilities, and lack of street surveillance for residents, all of which promote crime breeding. In existing studies, the boundary variables being considered are inadequate, and the lack of temporal analysis leads to insufficient precision of results to effectively guide relevant urban management. Therefore, this study explored the temporalspatial distribution pattern of larceny at multiple types of boundaries. The study used negative binomial regression to explore the temporal variation of each boundary’s impact on larceny. Results show that urban village boundaries need to be supervised more at night, whereas town boundaries should mainly be patrolled more during the day. In addition, to some extent, their temporal divergence of impact reflects the impact of security supervision and the mobility and heterogeneity of community residents on crime at each period. The relevant findings of this study are beneficial to the fine governance of cities and provide precise and effective policy recommendations for the construction of safe cities. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Seyed Mohammadreza Ghadiri and Yan Zhuge: individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Research on crime geography has traditionally focused on objective criminal activities and neglected subjective perceptions such as fear of crime, which is its major shortcoming. Using the deep learning algorithm of image regression, we analyzed the level of fear of crime under different streetscape environments on a large scale in the central urban area of Beijing. This approach compensates for the limitations of social surveys in terms of spatial coverage, spatial resolution, and reliability and validity of measures. Our indigenous deep learning models also make up for the lack of established models that rely on western city street view images and overseas labelers. Our study shows that, first, the spatial pattern of fear of crime has a circular, multi-cluster, and radial structure, and its level gradually increases from the city center to the suburbs. In contrast, the density/ number of theft and violent crimes have the spatial distribution with the opposite trend. Second, according to the relationship between the spatial distribution of fear of crime and criminal activities in general, we find a low match between subjective and objective security in the city center, with the objective situation being more dangerous than the subjective perception; in the suburban areas, the degree of match between the two increases; to the outer suburbs, these two still have a low degree of match, but the objective situation is safer than the subjective perception. Third, the built and social environmental factors that influence subjective and objective security are not always identical. A high-density and highly mixed environment would reduce fear of crime, but may accelerate crime. To reduce both fear and crime, it is recommended to add cul-de-sacs, improve the sense of enclosure, increase the amount of greenery, and eliminate various types of physical disorder. As for the effect of social disorganization, concentrated disadvantaged communities tend to have high levels of fear and are more prone to violent crime; population mobility can help reduce fear of crime; residential heterogeneity would exacerbate criminal behavior. Our findings help to clarify the differential explanatory power of classical crime geography theory for subjective and objective security, which in turn facilitates a comprehensive assessment of the security consequences of environmental intervention policies. © 2024, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - As the physical power information system undergoes continual advancement, mobile energy storage has become a pivotal component in the planning and orchestration of multi-component distribution networks. Furthermore, the evolution and enhancement of big data technologies have significantly contributed to enhancing the rationality and efficacy of various distribution network planning and layout approaches. At the same time, multi-distribution networks have also confronted numerous network attacks with increasing probability and severity. In this study, a Petri net is initially employed as a modeling technique to delineate the network attack flow within the distribution network. Subsequently, the data from prior network attacks are consolidated and scrutinized to evaluate the vulnerability of the cyber-physical system (CPS), thereby identifying the most critical network attack pattern for a multi-component distribution network. Following this, the defender–attacker–defender planning methodology is applied for scale modeling, incorporating rapidly evolving mobile energy storage into the pre-layout, aiming to mitigate the detrimental impact of network attacks on the power grid. Ultimately, the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is utilized to simulate and validate the proposed planning strategy in a 33-node system with multiple control groups established to demonstrate the viability and merits of the proposed strategy.

AB  - Based on mobile phone data from the city of Barcelona, Spain, generalized linear models are used to analyse the relationship between urban mobilities and the spatial and temporal patterning of robbery and theft. The hypothesis was made that mobility fluxes may undermine social control mechanisms by altering the socio-demographic composition of urban populations, therefore increasing the risk of crime victimization. The analysis brought together indicators of land use and a measure of the ambient population disaggregated by different profiles of public space users (by sex, age, and place of residence). The results indicate that robbery and theft tend to cluster around locations that attract a higher proportion of non-residents (i.e. national and international visitors). Non-local visitors, who visit the city occasionally or once in a lifetime, lack a comprehensive knowledge of the environment which would help them to navigate safely through the urban space. Therefore, their presence not only unsettles the social routines of public spaces in Barcelona but also reflects negatively in terms of crime occurrence. This finding raises questions about how to accommodate growing mobilities in our cities without detriment to incumbent residents and their safety, which seems to be critical in post-COVID-19 urban planning. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Cognitive intelligence is intelligence exhibited by the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through sense and thought processes. Cognitive intelligence in cybersecurity includes understanding the prospect of protection of digital devices, computer networks, websites, and cloud computing from both external and internal threats. Cyber threats like phishing, smishing, and data theft cause threats to business processes. In today’s day and age mobile, social networking and IoT are generating huge amounts of data. Analysis of the large volume of data helps in identifying the different attack vectors and their behavior pattern. It further can exceed the cognitive skills of security systems, rules, and protocols in organizations to keep the system more secure. Security analysts are now gathering huge amounts of data on users, networks, and transaction details. The captured data may reveal weak spots, hidden patterns, or disguised malicious activities. Evaluating and contemplating the underlying meaning of data is time-consuming and can be missed easily. In this paper, we are suggesting a few machine learning-based approaches to find the correlation between the data. This paper presents a cognitive classifier model that integrates machine learning with the data obtained from networks, web servers, logs, and cognitive processes to generate insight and knowledge which can be used to make the response actions better and more secure. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Wireless technology has become increasingly crucial and contributes to both short-range and long-range communication applications, such as remote health monitors and smart homes. Given the expectation of high-dense wireless communications in sixth-generation networks (6G), radio sensing technologies have recently gotten much attention. This work demonstrates a novel technique to monitor criminals in a restricted-access building via radio sensing. The sensing is performed on the latest commercial WiFi device. Accordingly, the data are discretely collected at several common positions to build baseline signal patterns. Next, we propose a few-shot learning model to train on a limited dataset. The testing results show that our system can recognize the mobility of a criminal behind the door, even with sparse training data. In some hazardous circumstances, this application can let law enforcement officials figure out criminal activities without physical intrusion, thus mitigating potential risks. Further, this model can also be applied to other commercial wireless networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - While previous research has underscored the profound influence of the ambient population distribution on the spatial dynamics of crime, the exploration regarding the impact of heterogeneity within the ambient population, such as different income groups, on crime is still in its infancy. With the support of mobile phone big data, this study constructs an index of ambient population heterogeneity to represent the complexity of the social environment. After controlling for the effects of total ambient population, nonlocal rate, transportation accessibility, crime attractors, and crime generators, this study employs a negative binomial regression model to examine the influence of ambient population heterogeneity and different income groups on the spatial manifestations of thefts. The findings indicate that ambient population heterogeneity significantly escalates the incidence of thefts, with middle and upper-middle-income groups acting as more attractive targets, whereas the higher-income group exerts a deterrent effect. The interaction analysis shows that increased population heterogeneity contributes to social disorder, thereby amplifying the attractiveness of the ambient population to perpetrators. These conclusions highlight the crucial role of ambient population heterogeneity in explaining crime dynamics and therefore enrich the routine activity theory. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Estimates of intergenerational economic mobility for a recent U.S. birth cohort published by Opportunity Insights reveal a striking empirical puzzle: while there is a substantial gap in the upward mobility outcomes achieved by low-income Black and White males there is no such racial mobility gap for females. This study examines municipal police force size as a potential driver of these disparate mobility patterns. Although a larger police force may enhance mobility outcomes for all low-income children through reducing exposure to crime, for Black males prior work suggests this will be offset by the disparate negative impact of increased contact with the criminal justice system. Analyzing a sample of 200 major U.S. cities, linear models find a positive association between the number of police officers per capita and the size of the racial mobility gap for males, but not for females. We go on to show more police personnel in the late 1990s is associated with an increased gap in the likelihood of incarceration for Black males relative to White males. Taken together, our findings point to the heterogeneous impacts of policing for different race-sex groups as one potential explanation for why we observe a racial mobility gap between Black and White males and why this gap is larger in some cities and smaller in others. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study, based on data from 2015 to 2019 on the movement of offenders to the Metropolitan Region of Chile, uses Poisson and Negative Binomial models to analyze the flow of offenders from other Chilean regions. It confirms that factors such as gender, educational level, location of crime, and type of crime significantly motivate displacement. The profile of the typical offender is an educated man who commits crimes against property on public roads, coming mainly from neighboring and populated regions. These findings have implications for crime prevention, suggesting that strategies to prevent crime should take this into account. Future research at the commune level is proposed for a more detailed understanding of offender displacement patterns and to inform local crime-prevention strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Our civilization has become increasingly reliant on technology. People all over the world are surrounded by smart devices, which begin with communication. Communication aided the development of gadgets such as automobiles, televisions, and other electronic equipment, all of which are now connected to the Internet. In addition, as technology advances, so does crime. The facial recognition security we provide in our mobile phones is probably not very much safer. The concept of facial recognition cannot afford that much security. This paper proposes biometric authentication by means of two-factor facial recognition. In addition to this, we can use iris scanning to make it much safer and secure. The advantages of iris scanning are that these structures do not change over time, and surgery cannot also modify the characteristics and appearance of their pattern. There is a large inter-class variability, such that there is a lot of difference even between the irises of twins. Technology has a tendency to fall short. To safeguard from such a type of problem, we can use two-factor authentication. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

AB  - Mobile Forensic Data Analysis is an approach that aims to discover criminals by utilizing data collected from mobile devices and algorithms that detect suspicious patterns. In situations where criminal action is linked to automated processes, such as the propagation of malware, it is simple to anticipate the outcome. Prediction and detection become more appealing for situations in which human behavior is involved, such as in typical criminal cases. The current study suggests a combined criminal profiling and suspicious pattern detection approach. The study focuses on cyberbullying and small-scale drug sales, both of which rely extensively on mobile devices. Another focus of the study is on the identification of suspicious patterns. Through the connecting of several observable patterns, our evidence-based strategy leads to an increase in accuracy and a reduction in the number of false positives on a dataset. Immediately following the evaluation and presentation of the outcomes of tests carried out on a dataset that contains both benign and malicious traffic, the scenarios are re-executed on a real dataset for the purpose of conducting additional testing and verification. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2024.

AB  - Prehistoric stone tools allow for detailed insights into patterns of movements of the human body and the mobility of individuals and groups. As contextualized at the beginning of this chapter, such a behavioural perspective is rooted in so-called “Processual Archaeology”, which we imply as the starting point of our approach, devoted to deciphering vernacular choreographies casting the everyday life of early humans. Here, we use settlement locales on the Crimea peninsula in order to describe three scales of human mobility. All sites were occupied by the last Neanderthal humans, about 45,000 years ago. At a small scale, we reconstruct recipes of stone tool production with gestures of human arms, hands, and fingers, all within the kinesphere or kinaesthetic bodily space of an individual Neanderthal. The embodied performances of knapping are considered “body techniques” in the sense of Marcel Mauss. Two more scales are then dealt with in lesser detail: at an intermediate scale, a small campsite is considered as a choreographic “stage” for movements of the human body, walking, standing, and sitting down, all related to disassembling three animals hunted nearby and brought to the dwelling place. At a large scale, we compare a cluster of settlement sites that supposedly belonged to the same, seasonally geared mobility system, thus describing an annual itinerary of humans through their landscape. As a result, we envisage the option of understanding artefacts and objects as expressions of an ancient practice, geared by vernacular choreography. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This article deals with the war crimes committed during the First World War. Whereas in historiography the presence of franc-tireurs, the new industrial warfare or the specific military and radicalised command culture of individual armies often served as explanatory patterns for the escalation of violence, this contribution attempts to introduce a different perspective into the discussion. The focus is on the specific violence of mobile warfare, which was articulated in the context of military “forward panics” (Randall Collins) on the Eastern and Balkan fronts and was responsible for a considerable part of the war crimes committed there. The article therefore deals with the nature and character of these military forward panics. Starting with a description of the spatial characteristics of the front as a specific space of violence, the role of military orders and the significance of the front as a soldierly space of imagination, the article analyses above all the structural violence of forward panics. In this context, the article discusses three factors that played an essential role in this escalation process: first, the special soldierly frame of reference of combat in mobile warfare, which continuously lowered the inhibition thresholds for the escalation of violence; second, the escalation-forcing dynamics that the swift advance or the flight-like retreat of the troops brought with it for the process of violence; and finally, third, the significance of soldierly group pressure for the process of escalation of violence. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a significant role in shaping smart cities by integrating vehicles, infrastructure, and information and communication technologies (ICT). IoV allows vehicles to connect and exchange information with each other and other smart devices contributing in shaping smart cities. IoV enables real-time data exchange between vehicles and traffic management systems. By collecting and analysing data on traffic flow, congestion, and road conditions, cities can optimize traffic signal timings, dynamically reroute vehicles, and provide drivers with real-time traffic updates. This improves traffic efficiency, reduces congestion, and enhances overall transportation systems. However, there is a risk that malicious vehicles may provide false information and interfere, or in the worst-case scenario, cause chaos on the roads. In order to address this issue, we propose a Blockchain-enabled intrusion detection system (BIDS) for the IoV network, in which vehicles share their mobility patterns with the traffic management system. BIDS formulates the mobility pattern of the vehicles in the form of blocks that are changed together. The blocks are validated and confirmed as the vehicle reaches the next location as claimed. Otherwise, the following blocks will become invalid and obviously will not be considered in the traffic management system. Our simulations show that the BIDS method can detect up to 98% of malicious vehicles when only 5% of the vehicles are malicious, and up to 85% when 40% of the vehicles are malicious. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This paper incorporates an explicit mobility dimension into the definition of the neighbourhood and explores its possible implications for the study of spatially distributed phenomena. We analysed the distribution of robbery and theft in Barcelona, Spain, as a testing application. Crime data were aggregated to nonoverlapping units (census tracts) and to a new measure of overlapping neighbourhoods, that we named ‘walkhoods’, accounting for the distance that can be covered in 5 min at a walking speed of 1 m/s, considering all possible physical barriers. The outcomes of regression models shed new light on the relationship between mobility and crime. When the walkhood scale is established, human mobility patterns have a stronger effect on the outcome variables than when census tracts are used. Results point to walkability constraints and social distances imposed by the massive presence of sporadic users in public spaces as strong predictors of crime occurrence, arguably due to their negative effects on neighbourhood social ties formation. Our findings suggest that more flexible definitions of the neighbourhood could address the social and spatial heterogeneity of urban spaces more properly than traditional approaches. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Vehicle-road cooperation systems (VRCSs) use next-generation Internet technologies, including 5G, edge computing, and artificial intelligence to improve mobility, comfort, and travel efficiency. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem serves as the technological backbone for VRCS by enabling seamless communication and data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management centers. This enables real-time, high-speed communication, efficient data processing, and enhanced security, fostering the development of autonomous driving, smart traffic management, and seamless connectivity within the VRCS ecosystem. At the same time, cyber attacks have become more complex, persistent, organized, and weaponized in IoV network. Threat intelligence (TI) has emerged as a prominent security approach to obtain a complete view of the dynamically growing cyber threat environment. On the other hand, modeling TI is a challenging task due to the limited labels available for different cyber threat sources. Second, most of the available designs require a large investment of resources and use handcrafted features, making the entire process error-prone and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, this article presents TIMIF, a deep-learning-based TI modeling and identification framework for intelligent IoV and is based on three key modules: first, the proposed TIMIF adopts an automated pattern extractor (APE) module to extract hidden patterns from IoV networks. Employing its output, we design a TI-based detection (TIBD) module to detect abnormal behavior and TI-attack type identification (TIATI) module to identify attack types. Extensive experiments are carried out on three different publicly intrusion data sources, namely, HCRL-car hacking, ToN-IoT, and CICIDS-2017 to illustrate the utility of the TIMIF framework over some commonly used baselines and state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The machine learning techniques paired with augmented reality (AR) systems extend the capabilities of surveillance systems for the social good through analyzing and extracting complex patterns in a simple and cost-effective AR-based app running on any mobile device. The potential of this app in crime prevention provides opportunities for this study to investigate the development of a portable, inexpensive surveillance system using an Android device that mainly focuses on detecting deadly weapons to promote public safety, especially in urbanized areas. The detection of deadly weapons beforehand is a proactive act before the crime happens. The study utilized the detection models offered by TensorFlow, an open-source machine-learning platform with a broad and adaptable ecosystem of tools and libraries. After the functional and performance tests, the study found that the AR-based weapon detection system could detect the weapons and recognize and classify them based on the computation of the detection confidence. Thus, the cost-efficient and portable system showcased its potential as a proactive surveillance tool that detects and alerts for the weapon's existence. However, there is still a need to improve its detection capability for it to be able to increase its detection rate, especially in crowded areas, at far distances, in dark places, and those obstructed and concealed weapons. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Extensive criminological research has documented a ‘distance-decay’ effect in criminal activity, with offenders less likely to commit crimes farther from their residences. While recent studies have identified similar patterns in ideologically motivated violence, variation in the travel behaviors of extremists remains underexplored. Using data on right-wing extremists who carried out a violent plot, between 2000 and 2020, alongside information on Capitol insurrectionist arrestees–and drawing on routine activity and rational-choice theories of offender decision-making–this study extends this literature along three dimensions: type, time, and ties. First, we distinguish between different types of offenders, showing that while both violent extremists and insurrectionists exhibit distance-decays, the latter tend to travel farther and exhibit a more irregular decay. Secondly, we identify a meaningful temporal shift in the right-wing extremist landscape, with offenders increasingly traveling longer distances to execute their plots. Finally, we highlight the role of social ties in shaping travel behaviors, where individuals affiliated with extremist groups tend to travel longer distances. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the spatial behavior of right-wing extremists, the factors influencing their mobility, and the evolving nature of right-wing extremism in the United States. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The rising rate of vehicle theft in our country is a pressing concern, prompting the need for effective solutions. Existing theft deterrents often lack precision, necessitating a reliable identification system. Biometric technology, with its authentication via unique physical traits like fingerprints and iris patterns, emerges as a promising solution. Additionally, current environmental conditions, marked by pollution and smog, pose risks to safe driving, increasing accident and theft risks due to reduced visibility. Our project integrates infrared sensor technology to enhance visibility and obstacle detection in adverse conditions. Research on algorithms is encouraging: the Haar Cascade Classifier boasts a detection rate exceeding 95%, and Deep Face Recognition achieves an impressive 98.76% accuracy. Furthermore, Infrared (IR) sensors emerge as costefficient and responsive solutions, unaffected by environmental factors. These findings underscore face recognition biometric authentication as the recommended vehicle security approach, with potential scalability through cloud-based systems promising enhanced security measures.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Financial investigations in the realm of fraud detection demand rigorous data analysis to identify anomalies and inform decision-making. This paper demonstrates the importance of data visualization as a means of conducting initial assessments of testable datasets to validate their suitability and promptly detect unexpected patterns before delving deeper into investigations. Using the publicly available PAYSIM dataset as a case study, we analyzed 6,362,620 records, of which 8213 were fraudulent and the remainder were legitimate. The dataset comprised 9 features and a single target class. Our analysis reveals the powerful role of visualization in identifying early indications of incompatibility with the dataset and guiding analysts to question its fitness for the context at hand. In particular, we show how visualization can highlight key findings and provide an added emphasis to the results. Through visual and numerical analysis, we demonstrate the importance of identifying potential outliers and other anomalies before proceeding with data preprocessing and modeling. Our results suggest that visual analysis of data is an essential step in detecting fraudulent activities in mobile money transactions. This approach can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems, thereby protecting users from financial losses. We conclude that data visualization should be an integral part of any data analysis project, especially in the field of fraud detection, to ensure the validity and suitability of the data before proceeding with further investigations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: With COVID-19 came a range of public health measures that impacted people’s routine activities. According to routine activity theory, these could affect the rate and nature of crime. This has largely been examined with volume crime (e.g., burglary, robbery) or crimes committed in the home. Stranger sex offenses greatly vary in nature and occur in a range of settings; therefore, these offenses present a novel opportunity to investigate different routine activity theory-based hypotheses. Method: The National Crime Agency routinely collects detailed information about all stranger sex offenses reported to the police in the United Kingdom. With these standardized data (N = 6,422), we studied the relationship between COVID-19 public health measures and the rate and characteristics of stranger sex offending across the entire first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasting this with data from the same period pre-COVID-19. Results: Our findings accord with classic criminological theory whereby the incidence and characteristics of U.K. stranger sex offenses reported to police covaried with the population’s patterns of mobility and national lockdowns during the first year of COVID-19. This impact on routine activities also manifested in differences in perpetrator and victim behavior and characteristics. Conclusions: Our study supports the applicability of routine activity theory to sex offending and brings new insights regarding the situational prevention of sex offending during major events such as a pandemic. It is also relevant to the urgent need to educate prosecutors who are now making decisions about sex offenses perpetrated during the early years of this pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - With the help of a lip print, it is feasible to differentiate between forensic and non-forensic cases. Even though numerous pieces of research aimed at recognizing and categorizing lip print patterns have been published, it has not yet been decided which classification of lip prints from large populations and unconstrained scenarios to detect the presence of crimes. In this research paper, we propose an advanced deep learning based optimization framework designed to identify the lip print, an essential component in forensic investigations. Our approach leverages the Large-Scale Multi-Camera Detection dataset. The collected lip prints are preprocessed, feature extracted and then classified using the MobileNet model with residual learning. The simulation is conducted in MATLAB to enhance the robustness of lip print recognition over various performance metrics that include accuracy of 99.6 %, precision of 99.21 %, recall of 99.43 %, and f-measure of 99.31 %. The results show that the proposed method achieves a higher rate of classification accuracy than other methods. Then the results were improved by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. © 2024

AB  - In the context of the 5G network, the proliferation of access devices results in heightened network traffic and shifts in traffic patterns, and network intrusion detection faces greater challenges. A feature selection algorithm is proposed for network intrusion detection systems that uses an improved binary pigeon-inspired optimizer (SABPIO) algorithm to tackle the challenges posed by the high dimensionality and complexity of network traffic, resulting in complex models, reduced accuracy, and longer detection times. First, the raw dataset is pre-processed by uniquely one-hot encoded and standardized. Next, feature selection is performed using SABPIO, which employs simulated annealing and the population decay factor to identify the most relevant subset of features for subsequent review and evaluation. Finally, the selected subset of features is fed into decision trees and random forest classifiers to evaluate the effectiveness of SABPIO. The proposed algorithm has been validated through experimentation on three publicly available datasets: UNSWNB15, NLS-KDD, and CIC-IDS-2017. The experimental findings demonstrate that SABPIO identifies the most indicative subset of features through rational computation. This method significantly abbreviates the system's training duration, enhances detection rates, and compared to the use of all features, minimally reduces the training and testing times by factors of 3.2 and 0.3, respectively. Furthermore, it enhances the F1-score of the feature subset selected by CPIO and Boost algorithms when compared to CPIO and XGBoost, resulting in improvements ranging from 1.21% to 2.19%, and 1.79% to 4.52%. © (2024), (PeerJ Inc.).

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of recent South America migration governance. Recent migration dynamics in South America have been marked by intra-regional and extra-regional mobility patterns. While such intra-regional movements have had as their destination mainly countries of the Southern Cone-such as Argentina, Chile and Brazil-recent mobility has also changed migration patterns in countries such as Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. In particular, the exodus of more than seven million Venezuelans has led to significant changes in migration flows and policies in the region. This chapter reflects on the changes in migration governance in South America in the last decade, and how it has been framed and justified through the lens of "multiple crises". The chapter argues that South America has been developing a patchwork approach to migration governance, characterised by fragmented and reactive measures, with practices that evidence both continuity and change. The development of this approach is leading to more control, the criminalisation of migration, increased migrant irregularity and less protection for people on the move. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the contemporary era, computer vision applications assume significance due to their role in the real world. Video surveillance is one such application that has become indispensable with plenty of unprecedented applications. Detection of abnormal events from surveillance videos in real time has its importance in applications like traffic monitoring, crime investigation, public safety, healthcare and operations management to mention few. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) automatic video surveillance is taken to the next level with sophistication in learning detection of anomalies. Particularly deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is found more appropriate for image processing. However, as one size does not fit all, CNN does not provide acceptable accuracy unless it is enhanced with suitable number of layers and configurations. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning architecture known as VidAnomalyNet which is based on CNN model. It is designed to have more appropriate learning process and detection of anomalies from surveillance videos. We proposed a framework to exploit our VidAnomalyNet architecture for leveraging detection performance. We also proposed an algorithm known as VidAnomalyNet for Automatic Anomaly Detection (VAAD). Automatic anomaly detection in the context of video anomaly networks refers to the use of computational methods to automatically identify unusual or abnormal patterns within a sequence of video frames. The goal is to develop models that can distinguish between normal activities and unexpected events or anomalies. Video anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, including surveillance, industrial monitoring, and public safety. At present, this algorithm detects three classes of anomalies like fire, accident and robbery. It can be easily extended to identify more number of anomalies. We also explored MobileNetV1 with transfer learning by adding new layers to the base model for video anomaly detection. Our empirical study has revealed that VidAnomalyNet outperforms MobileNetV1. Highest accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 96.35%. ©2024 The authors.

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders’ knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders’ pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members’ home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge—where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities—and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders’ crime location choices. © 2024 Georgia State University.

AB  - Purpose: In this research, I investigated the link between collective mobility patterns—specifically inward population flow and residential mobility—and changes in reported gun violence incidents in Baltimore City. I also examined whether this relationship differs among various types of gun violence. Furthermore, I explored the potential moderating influence of collective mobility patterns on the relationship between neighborhood hotspot coverage and occurrences of gun violence. Methods: The data were sourced from a blend of mobile device location data, Part 1 crime data from the Baltimore Police Department, the American Community Survey, and the zoning map of Baltimore. I used Poisson regression with Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (MESF) for the analysis. Results: Inward population flow consistently exhibited a positive relationship with gun violence regardless of its subtype, whereas residential mobility demonstrated significant influence primarily on firearm-related robbery incidents. Moderation analysis indicated that depending on the type of gun violence being assessed, either inward population flow or residential mobility could attenuate its association with neighborhoods' crime hotspot coverage. Conclusions: Understanding collective mobility patterns is crucial for comprehending the spread of gun violence. Such insights can assist law enforcement agencies in refining hotspot policing strategies and adapting police tactics accordingly. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mobile gambling apps, as a new type of online gambling service, have not only enriched people's online entertainment activities but also brought about negative impacts for both individuals and society. Existing gambling app detection methods mainly extract static content-based characteristics, such as vision and textual features, to mine the key information from the user interface to detect gambling apps. In this paper, we are the first to introduce a dynamic communication characteristic-based approach by utilizing encrypted traffic analysis. Firstly, we conduct an analysis of the communication characteristics of 175 popular gambling apps in China, and unveil their important server domain name randomization and inter-app level familial characteristics, which cannot be well-leveraged by previous encrypted traffic analysis methods. Based on the analysis results, we design HeCGamb, a Heterogeneous Communication Graph-based method to enhance the Gambling app detection performance. HeCGamb models the inter-flow relations from various traffic flows to mine the flow-level communication patterns of gambling apps. Based on the inter-flow relations, HeCGamb further constructs inter-app relations to utilize the app-level familial characteristics. Finally, the multi-view semantic information from both servers and apps with inter-app relations are fused to generate the app node representations to comprehensively leverage the characteristics from server domains and familial apps. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate the superior performance(94.1% F1-score and 96.8% AUC score in open world) of HeCGamb, but also highlight its potential in gambling industry chain tracking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emotion dysregulation (ED) has primarily been described in patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) and is an integral part of this diagnosis, but it is also a transdiagnostic construct that can be found in several other psychiatric disorders. The strong relationships between ED and BPD may lead clinicians to underestimate ED associated to other clinical contexts. This can lead to difficulties in diagnostic and treatment orientation, especially in the context of comorbidities. In this article, after reviewing the literature on the development and functioning of emotion dysregulation, and on the evidence for emotion dysregulation in eight disorders (borderline personality disorder, pathological narcissism with/without narcissistic personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), we present a transdiagnostic processual model of emotion dysregulation based on core triggers and interpersonal styles to try to address this issue and to provide a simple but technical tool to help clinicians in their diagnostic assessment and treatment orientation. By focusing more on typical patterns and interpersonal dynamics than only on categories, we believe that this model may contribute to the actual need for improvement of our current psychiatric classifications, alongside other well-studied and under-used dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., HiTOP, AMPD), and may be useful to build more specific treatment frameworks for patients suffering from ED.

AB  - The research article addresses the intersection of healthcare monitoring and crime prevention via wearable devices in hospital settings. It proposes a system leveraging blockchain, decision-making algorithms, and wireless communication, particularly IoT and gradient-boosting approaches. Existing health care monitoring lacks real-time intervention capabilities, and conventional crime prevention methods are often reactive rather than proactive. The revolutionary combination of gradient boosting and hybrid microwave transmission-based wearable devices is the ultimate solution to combat patient health data theft. With this cutting-edge technology, this research can confidently detect and prevent unauthorised access to sensitive healthcare information, ensuring the safety and privacy of patients. The proposed system ensures continuous health monitoring and prompt interventions while enhancing crime prevention through mobile data analysis. Blockchain and decision-making algorithms are integrated to securely store patient data and enable authorised personnel access for review. IoT and gradient-boosting algorithms facilitate real-time health monitoring and accurate prediction of crime-related patterns through mobile data analysis. The proposed gradient boosting algorithm has an RMSE of 0.105 and an MAE of 0.010, suggesting great prediction accuracy. With a V AF score of 96% and an R-squared score of 0.94, it captures data variability while demonstrating predictive solid power. This comprehensive strategy utilises cutting-edge technology to enhance healthcare monitoring via wearable devices, contribute to crime prevention, and address crucial concerns in healthcare and public safety. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - UAV-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has sparked significant research interest. UAVs are positioned as aerial wireless platforms, extending coverage and improving Sensing and Communication (S&C) services. However, integrating UAVs introduces vulnerabilities due to multi-connectivity, necessitating robust security measures. To address this, efforts are focused on developing effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Here ML-based IDSs depend on the most suited Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for improved detection accuracy. However, inadequate detection features frequently contribute to the limitations of detection accuracy in various emerging cyber-attacks. Our study explores attack traits in UAV-enabled 6G networks, using complementary detection features to enhance ML-based attack detection. Additionally, existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) solutions for UAVs-enabled 6G networks mainly use single models (e.g., CNN, SVM, CGAN) instead of multi-tier models, (e.g., Hybrid, Fusion, Ensemble). Here, although the use of a single model can be faster for computer systems, it is difficult to understand the growing complexity of intrusion patterns in data. Also, these single models might not be good at recognizing the unique patterns of less common issues in datasets. Thus, we propose a fusion multi-tier DNN-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (CIDPS) for critical UAV-enabled 6G networks. This system boosts accuracy without sacrificing latency reductions. Our approach learns decision boundaries from imbalanced data points using preceding DNNs sequentially. Moreover, most existing research works do not focus on intrusion prevention methods and deployment frameworks for UAV networks. This research proposes effective IPS mechanisms and deployment architecture for CIDPS in UAV-enabled 6G networks. It incorporates a CIDPS with an emergency response protocol, neutralizing attacks upon anomaly detection. We validate our solution through diverse dataset experiments (UAVIDS-2020, NF-UQ-NIDS-v2, 5G-NIDD). Unlike traditional practices where IDS are simulated, we implement CIDPS on actual UAV devices (PX4 Vision Dev Kit V1.5, DJI mini se, DJI mini 3 pro) and real-world UAV networks. Our approach outperforms prior algorithms with a 99.25% attack classification accuracy, higher detection efficiency, and lower resource usage, exceeding 99.05% detection rates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - What happens when militant groups must choose between logistical needs and ideology, and how does that trade-off impact subsequent violence? Many groups balance both strategic and psychological considerations but ultimately weigh one more heavily than the other. We propose a typology based on this trade-off between logistical and ideological resources and the degree of violence against civilians. We propose that combination produces four overarching ideal types: violent militants, militant opportunists, professional militants, or disciplined militants. We conduct a plausibility probe of the types and propose a model of how groups re-produce violence patterns once established. The four cases – the Weather Underground, al-Qaida in Iraq, the Revolutionary United Front, and autodefensas in Mexico – are extreme cases that vary in their calculus of logistics versus ideology and their degree of violence. We find that all types go through a standard process to establish and perpetuate their approach to violence. In addition, groups experience different advantages and pitfalls based on their trade-off calculus. An ideological emphasis is typically accompanied by greater oversight of recruitment and tactics, but groups that become too ideologically rigid risk collapsing from organisational problems and difficulties connecting with their constituents. Conversely, those that weigh logistical considerations more heavily have less oversight over recruitment, which increases their risks of infiltration by opportunists and criminals. © (2024), (Terrorism Research Initiative).

AB  - With the rapid evolution of cyber threats, social engineering attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, leveraging human vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures. While many conventional defense mechanisms have been overwhelmed, Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising avenue to detect, prevent, and respond to these emerging threats. This research analyzes the intricacies of contemporary social engineering attacks, from their methods of deployment to their recent adaptations, such as leveraging social media and mobile apps. By contrasting prior solutions with the potential of AI-based defenses, we highlight the key role of machine learning in behavioral pattern recognition, Natural Language Processing's (NLP) efficacy in identifying phishing attempts, and predictive analytics' power to anticipate future attack vectors. Through detailed case studies, we showcase real-world scenarios where AI mechanisms have successfully countered social engineering ploys. The findings reveal that AI-enhanced mechanisms significantly improve the identification and mitigation of social engineering threats. Specifically, AI-driven behavioral analytics effectively detect subtle, manipulative cues indicative of phishing and other deceitful tactics, considerably reducing the incidence of successful attacks. Furthermore, predictive analytics has shown great promise in forecasting and preemptively countering potential cyber threats, In addition, while effective, AI tools must evolve with the changing tactics of cyber threats, Continuous learning and updating are necessary to maintain and improve accuracy and effectiveness.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The increasing use of remote or mobile access, integrated wearable technologies, data exchange, and cloud-based data analytics in modern smart buildings is steering the building industry towards open communication technologies. The increased connectivity and accessibility could lead to more cyber-attacks in smart buildings. On the other hand, physical faults (e.g., HVAC − heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning faults) may have similar adverse impacts as those from the cyber-attacks on building energy systems, such as occupant discomfort, energy wastage, and equipment downtime. However, current physical behavior-based anomaly detection methods fail to differentiate between cyber-attacks and physical faults in building energy systems. Moreover, the challenge in collecting real-world threat data with ground truth has led researchers to rely on numerical models with user-defined assumptions, which may not accurately reflect real-world conditions due to the lack of in-situ experimental datasets. To address these challenges and gaps, this paper presents a flexible hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed for generating cyber-attack and physical fault datasets and demonstrating threat detection algorithms in a real building automation system (BAS) environment. This testbed combines hardware (i.e., real BAS with local HVAC controllers and a physical network) with software (i.e., high-fidelity models to represent behaviors of building envelope and HVAC energy systems), enabling emulations of realistic threats. Five HIL experiments, including one baseline without any threats, two with physical faults, and two with cyber-attacks, were conducted to generate datasets containing detailed network traffic and system states. A joint classification framework, incorporating a network analyzer and a physical HVAC fault detector, was proposed to automatically detect cyber-physical abnormalities on BAS at both the network and the physical HVAC levels. The network analyzer comprises a conditional random fields (CRF) based command validator and a statistics-based detection strategy. The fault detector employs a weather and schedule-based pattern matching and feature-based principal component analysis (WPM-FPCA) method. Evaluation of the classification using four metrics from the multi-class confusion matrix revealed an average accuracy of 90.2 %, recall of 89.7 %, precision of 88.5 % and F1-score of 89.2 %. These results demonstrate that the proposed joint classification framework can effectively differentiate between specific types of cyber-attacks (e.g., device reinitialization attack, network Denial-of-Service attack) and physical faults (e.g., air handling unit operational fault, cooling coil valve stuck) in real time for improved building energy management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) has proven to be a useful tool in forensic and criminal investigations for quite some time. Traditionally, documenting a crime scene for a bloodletting event was completed using manual techniques, physical strings, and a tape measure. In more recent years, laser scanners and 3D software programs have become a preferred method to capture accurate data that improves the validity and reliability of BPA. The initial cost of laser scanning equipment is relatively high, rendering these systems inaccessible to some police and smaller agencies. Recon-3D is a newly developed iPhone application that utilizes the iPhone LiDAR sensor in combination with video data to create 3D point clouds of crime scenes. To assess the viability of Recon-3D for area of origin analysis, two tests were performed. One was a series of bloodstain impacts which were analyzed in FARO Zone 3D software, while the second was a series of 6 repeated Recon-3D scans of two 90-degree walls which was then compared to the FARO Focus S350 scanner using CloudCompare software. A total of eight impact patterns were made at three different distances from a wall. The area of origin was measured and compared to the known location of the blood source. The average total 3D error for the area of origin set at 25, 50, and 100 cm from two perpendicular walls was found to be 6.04, 15.16, and 36.59 cm, respectively. These results are similar to past studies where programs such as HemoSpat have been used. The results of the point cloud comparison show that on average, 95% of the points from Recon-3D fall below a threshold of 3.6 mm when compared to a FARO Focus S350 laser scanner. Thus, the results of this test suggest that Recon-3D is an accurate and affordable scanning application for bloodstain patterns at crime scenes and the data provide acceptable results for area of origin analysis in BPA programs which accept laser scanner data. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Do neighborhoods have boundaries? Scholars have debated how neighborhoods should be operationalized for decades. While recent scholarship has de-emphasized boundaries, I argue that boundaries are focal to understanding what neighborhoods are and why they are so segregated. Relying on everyday mobility patterns data from a panel of 45 million nationally representative devices, I demonstrate that divisions between contiguous census block groups in terms of everyday mobility patterns align with divisions in race, educational attainment, occupation, and age. Employing a novel clustering procedure, I further demonstrate that sets of census block groups can be easily separated in terms of differences in mobility patterns, indicating that meaningful clusters and boundaries within cities do exist. Subsequent results indicate these clusters are uniquely segregated in terms of race, educational attainment, and age, highlighting how other spatial aggregations can underestimate true segregation. Additional results suggest that unique social processes divide these clusters from one another, as indicated by exceptional variation in both COVID-19 case incidence and criminal offense timing. While I do not believe these clusters represent objective “neighborhoods,” I do assert that they can serve as a useful geographical unit for social analyses. These clusters may also be useful for measuring segregation in mobility patterns as well as for studying mobility network resiliency. © 2024 Karl Vachuska.

AB  - Insider threats are perhaps the most serious challenges that nuclear and radiological security systems face. Insiders pose such a great threat due to their access, authority, and knowledge, granting them opportunities to bypass dedicated nuclear and radiological security elements. For example, in one of the latest major insider threat incidents to nuclear security, the Doel-4 nuclear powerplant in Belgium suffered a shutdown, the threat of nuclear materials diversion, and long-term loss of tens of millions of dollars. Seven years of investigation concluded that it was an inside job and attempted sabotage. In this regard, there is an immediate need for R&D and technology integration in the domain of modeling indoor Patterns-of-Life (PoL) and anomaly detection. This can be achieved by using datasets of facility users' mobility and activity, which can support the design of algorithms for insider threat modeling and detection. However, due to classification, privacy, sensitivity, and safety protocols, such datasets from real physical nuclear reactor facilities are not only hard to share, but also not always feasible to deploy and collect. Aiming to find an alternate solution, our proposed demonstration work - MetaPoL, is the first-ever (for the application space) immersive VR (virtual reality) environment of a real-world secure facility and allows users to move-and-stay through the designed indoor physical layout and also encounter NPCs (non-player characters) that emulate other facility users. In the MetaPoL an interactive user performs realistic spatio-temporal movement, dwelling and activities using a Meta Quest Pro VR headset, and that generates high-frequency (in time) high-resolution (in space) indoor spatial-temporal datasets that are valuable for PoL modeling and anomaly detection research specifically for insider threat modeling and detection mission. Such generated realistic, rich in context, and mission specific datasets can boost AI/Machine Learning based research for modeling and detecting insider threats in nuclear security and nonproliferation. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: We investigate the role that neighborhood socioeconomic contexts and defendant mobility patterns play in prosecutorial charge reductions. Methods: Using data from a large sample of criminal defendants prosecuted during 2010 to 2011 in New York County (N = 68,113), we analyze differences in charge reductions for defendants who reside and offend in low- and high-income areas, and for those who traverse socioeconomically divergent neighborhoods when committing crime. Results: Net of individual defendant characteristics, like gender and race, we find that defendants from low-income neighborhoods who offend in high-income locales are significantly less likely to benefit from discretionary charge reductions. Conclusions: Defendant mobility patterns play a key role in defining the social context of criminal punishment. This suggests it is essential to consider both where a defendant resides and where their crime is committed when assessing the role of ecological stereotypes and place-based attributions in criminal court actor decision-making. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - After the advent of industry 4.0, technologies are comprehensively unveiled to the public. Because of this, the proliferation in demand for technology in every field has begun to soar. Today, in the modern society, the pattern of crimes against women is increasing unprecedentedly. Cybercrimes are more frequent than traditional crimes. Therefore, Mobile Forensics (MF), a subset of digital forensics plays a crucial role in extracting the digital evidence. The technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is then incorporated to improve the efficiency and accuracy in mobile forensics and digital investigation. This study addresses the significance, challenges, and effects of integrating AI in Mobile Forensics and Digital Investigation (DI). In addition, this research study also emphasizes on the stages or directives of mobile forensics, which are considered as essential components in gathering the evidence. It fills the void by analyzing how various technologies and techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and data mining can be used in mobile forensics. Eventually, this study is concluded by providing the suggestions for its advancement and avoidance while illustrating the challenges to negate the same in the future. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Violence detection has garnered significant attention as there's a growing demand for automated methods to identify violent actions. This surge in interest stems from the utilization of surveillance cameras in diverse locations, where visual data is analysed to detect instances of violence. The project's objectives are tailored to address key research gaps within the realm of crime detection. Firstly, it aims to refine a pre-trained model through meticulous fine-tuning, culminating in the development of a robust crime detection algorithm. Secondly, the project endeavours to transcend theoretical realms by deploying this model in real-time scenarios, seamlessly integrating it with live camera feeds to enable continuous monitoring and analysis. Lastly, the project will conduct a thorough comparative analysis of various models, discerning their strengths and weaknesses to pinpoint the optimal solution for effective crime detection. Through these objectives, the project aspires to contribute significantly to the advancement of crime detection technologies. The methodology employed includes collecting images for the dataset, cleaning and pre-processing the data, augmenting it for diversity and it increases dataset diversity through transformations. Implementation is done of transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG, and training the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data for accurate predictions or classifications. Model training is essential for the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data, minimizing prediction errors. The results reveal a peak accuracy F1-score of 95% achieved with ResNet. A high F1score of 96% indicates strong performance in accurately identifying positive instances while minimizing false positives and false negatives.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Exposure to violence is a critical aspect of contemporary racial inequality in the United States. While extensive research has examined variations in violent crime rates across neighborhoods, less attention has been given to understanding individuals’ everyday exposure to violent crimes. This study investigates patterns of exposure to violent crimes among neighborhood residents using cell phone mobility data and violent crime reports from Chicago. The analysis reveals a positive association between the proportion of Black residents in a neighborhood and the level of exposure to violent crimes experienced by residents. Controlling for a neighborhood’s level of residential disadvantage and other neighborhood characteristics did not substantially diminish the relationship between racial composition and exposure to violent crimes in everyday life. Even after controlling for violence within residents’ neighborhoods, individuals residing in Black neighborhoods continue to experience significantly higher levels of violence in their day-to-day contexts compared to those living in White neighborhoods. This suggests that racial segregation in everyday exposures, rather than residential segregation, plays a central role in racial inequality in exposure to violence. Additionally, the analysis suggests that neighborhoods with more Hispanic and Asian residents are exposed to less and more violent crime, respectively, compared to neighborhoods with more White residents. However, this is only observed when not adjusting for the volume of visits points of interest receive; otherwise, the finding is reversed. This study offers valuable insights into potentially novel sources of racial disparities in exposure to violent crimes in everyday contexts, highlighting the need for further investigation. © The New York Academy of Medicine 2024.

AB  - The crime scene often reveals various types of wounds caused by weapons. It is the primary task of the first responders at the scene to determine the type of weapon based on the wound patterns. For newly graduated or inexperienced personnel, developing a mobile device capable of instantly identifying wounds and corresponding weapons would significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of crime scene investigations. This study utilizes deep neural networks to analyze the features of wound images and deploys the neural network on a portable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for hardware acceleration and offline recognition. Due to limited real wound photo data, we initially use simulated wounds made of resin clay as training data. By combining image processing techniques, we designed a neural network model with high accuracy and resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that this device has advantages such as lightweight, fast operation, accuracy, and offline capability, effectively overcoming environmental variables at the scene and providing objective analysis results to aid in the identification of weapons in crime scene investigations. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper explores the relational contours of financial fraud and economic vulnerability in Jakarta's new economy. By focusing on the experiences of the disillusioned and the disenfranchised across a range of class backgrounds, I show how money and mobility and crime and capitalism intersect in a dense urban environment. Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is considered the infrastructural and economic laboratory for Indonesia's new economy. As e-commerce and fintech alter consumption patterns and shape urban entrepreneurial and lifestyle aspirations for millions of Indonesians, the risks and advantages associated with increased financialization have had a profound impact on ordinary citizens. Indonesians are increasingly drawn into everyday, data-rich transactions that habituate and concretize the practice of speculative consumption and interactions with strangers in the city. While the state celebrates the outward rise of financial inclusion, the financialization of everyday life has also produced victims of financial fraud and deceit, in particular through predatory scams (modus) that rely on legal and regulatory gaps and intimate knowledge of others to succeed. This paper probes the social conditions that enable fraud and its extralegal resolutions, emphasizing the destabilizing, extraordinary experiences of urban citizens who see no justice for the ways they have been conscripted into a dangerous new economy.

AB  - The Space-Time Budget (STB) method is used to collect spatial and temporal features of an individual’s activities and is an important technique to explore relationships between the environment and crime. This spatial and temporal approach to the study of everyday activity spaces reveals much about victimisation experiences, the relationship between place, time, and perceptions of safety, and where and when offending may occur. Few studies, however, consider the relationship between living in a criminogenic place (neighbourhood crime) and people’s daily activity patterns. Drawing on disaggregate app-based data for 50 participants tracked over a 7-day period, we use sequence analysis to first delineate time allocation to each activity on a minute-by-minute basis. Next, using result from the sequence analysis we introduce the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to understand how neighbourhood crime and socio-demographic characteristics influence individuals’ time allocation to discrete daily activities. Results reveal that neighbourhood drug and violent incidents exert restrictions on an individual’s propensity to spend time outside the home. Females and older people appear more likely to be constrained by the presence of neighbourhood crime (in particular drug and property incidents) as they allocate less time to outdoor activities. The principal utility of the current study is its methodological advancement and the practical insights for urban planning regarding the design of crime prevention strategies to increase guardianship in public places. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Driving Insurance Applications (DIAs) have emerged as a valuable resource in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Automobile owners are storing extensive data on driving behaviors and patterns. This study pioneers the forensic analysis of Progressive's Snapshot application, focusing on the extraction and potential forensic use of data that remains inaccessible through the mobile application's interface. In our approach we focused on four research questions: How accurate is location and speed data collected by Progressive Snapshot?, What forensically relevant data can we extract from the Progressive Cloud that is unavailable to the user from the mobile application interface?, Can we employ anti-forensics techniques, specifically fake location data, to create false trip details?, Can we reconstruct a hit-and-run scenario from trip event details? To answer these questions, we developed PyShot, a Python-based open-source tool, to extract data from the Progressive cloud. Our tests confirmed Snapshot's accuracy in recording speed and location. Despite efforts to fake the Global Positioning System (GPS) location, the cloud still maintained accurate records. PyShot revealed more detailed driving data, like dangerous maneuvers and distracted driving, compared to the mobile application. This study also explores the forensic reconstruction of hit-and-run incidents, using a mannequin and focusing on Progressive's server data. Analyzing event categories, geographical coordinates, and timestamps provides insights into the capabilities and constraints of this application in forensic investigations. The findings offer valuable insights into the forensic capability of data retained by DIAs, contributing to their potential use in forensic investigations. © 2024

AB  - The increasing demand for internet, mobile, and IoT usage has led to a rise in cyber risks, with a high volume of data generated across industries. This poses a challenge in detecting anomalies effectively. Cyber-attacks jeopardize privacy, compliance, and lead to service interruptions, revenue loss, and customer churn. This research explores anomaly detection methods, including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning, in the context of prevalent data patterns and the five stages of cyber-attacks. Machine learning plays a crucial role in monitoring traffic, analyzing scan results, detecting, and blocking attacks, and revealing the attacker' s identity. The focus is on evaluating AI methods for anomaly detection, leveraging the H20.ai tool, known for its potent machine learning algorithms and seamless integration with existing systems. This enhances AI functionality for meaningful insights during cyber-attacks. The paper emphasizes the importance of robust anomaly detection in reducing Cyber Value at Risk (CVaR) and achieving cybersecurity excellence. While anomaly identification is crucial, the paper suggests it should be complemented by encryption, authentication, and incident response mechanisms for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. The research opens avenues for future exploration with additional AI tools and algorithms to minimize CVaR.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, environmental criminologists have explored the application of agent-based models (ABMs) of crime events and various theoretical frameworks applied to understand them. Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort. © 2023

AB  - This paper proposes a framework to examine how neighborhood factors influence criminal justice (CJ) contact and contribute to disparities across multiple stages of the justice process. By conceptualizing the punishment process as a dynamic set of decision-making points, this study highlights the role of neighborhood context in shaping offenders’ CJ trajectories and post-CJ residential inequality. Using Harris County, Texas, as a case study, this research considers individual-, neighborhood-, and event-level variables to understand the cumulative effects of neighborhood characteristics on CJ outcomes. This study underscores the critical need to investigate neighborhood mobility and its broader implications for community development and public policy. The findings can be supported by extensive data from the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers and the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System, offering a robust analysis of offenders’ spatial patterns and economic transitions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Criminal behavior, which takes its content from society, has been associated with social isolation, national quarantine, and mandatory stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been researched through crime rates. Moreover, it has been argued that changes in the level of social mobility also affect crime rates. Decreased crime rates have been reported during closure measures, and a significant literature has emerged based on these propositions. This study's retrospective approach was created to examine the appearance of crime rates in Türkiye. The main problem of the research is to reveal the relationship between crime, pandemic, and social mobility in Türkiye. For this purpose, it aimed to test the propositions based on a dual approach. First, patterns in crime rates were discovered. The data set regarding the most common crime types between 2018 and 2022, including pre-pandemic crime rates, was used. The most appropriate time series model was determined to understand the data structure regarding crime types, and it was tested whether there was a decrease or increase in crime rates during and after the pandemic. As a second step, the effect of social mobility on the change in crime was examined according to the mobility level data reported in this process. Evidence has shown decreased violence, theft, and drug crimes in the early part of the pandemic, consistent with the literature. While theft crimes decreased throughout the pandemic, violence and drug crimes increased. The view that crime rates will decrease if social mobility is restricted as a source of social life presented overlapping data in the pandemic. Changes in social mobility during the pandemic have affected crime rates for theft, injury, and drug use. Although there was a decrease in crime rates due to seasonal effects after the normalization process, it was observed that crime rates could change according to the content of social measures during the pandemic period. It is considered that this situation presents a particular slice for the future. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the dynamic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on property crime in Mexico. We do so for a longer time horizon than the existing literature and for two types of property crime: on-line and on-site. Methods: A retrospective ecological analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic using an event study methodology. This paper uses administrative data from Mexico’s National Public Security System from January 2017 to December 2022. Our data is structured as a monthly series covering all 2457 Mexican municipalities. Results: We find heterogeneity in the pandemic’s impact by type of property crime and a dynamic, permanent effect for both types of property crime. Namely, our results point to a drop and quick recovery of fraud—property crime mostly committed on-line—, which in the medium run surpasses pre-pandemic levels by 44%. Further, our results point to a significant drop in robbery, theft, domestic burglary, and motor vehicle theft—all property crimes committed on-site—, with a slight recovery after the end of the national lockdown, even though rates for these crimes never reached pre-pandemic levels. Conclusions: The 2020 pandemic caused a permanent shift in property crime from on-site to on-line spaces. Potential mechanisms point to disruptions in mobility in retail and recreational areas, residential zones, and workplaces as important mediating factors. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Indonesia's migration policy and border control strategy have given rise to complexities and weaknesses in both the COVID-19 period and its aftermath. This study examines the post-pandemic landscape of migration and border dynamics in Indonesia, investigating challenges posed by the Indonesian selective migration policy, emerging trends and patterns of people mobility, refugee inflows. Indonesia's migration policy and border management lack defined policy structures, political stands, and inadequate attention to emerging trends. International migration trends rise in Indonesia, although initially promising, it brings to light significant challenges such as irregular migration patterns, evolving cybercrime modus operandi, and transnational crime implications. The evolving global context requires a balance between facilitating movement, ensuring security, and promoting sustainability. We suggest four concepts for the migration and border control policy and concepts in Indonesia after the pandemic era. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Wildlife crime, especially in the notably hard-hit region of Sichuan and Chongqing, constitutes a pivotal research domain within green criminology research. Taking this region as the core research area, grounding our analysis in the theoretical framework of social-ecological systems theory, using spatial analysis, geo-detector and other methods, to explore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and influencing factors of wildlife crime in the Sichuan-Chongqing region. Study findings include the following: (1) wildlife crimes in the Sichuan-Chongqing regions mainly involve illegal hunting and killing precious and endangered wildlife, the species involved are predominantly birds and beasts, with the number of pheasants of the pheasant family, owls, and various snakes of the reptile family being the most numerous. The main body of the offence is far more men than women, and young adult Han people are often involved. The overall cultural level is low, and the main job is farming. (2) A single wildlife crime often involves a number of offenses; the most common criminal process involves (seller) hunting/hunting-killing-transportation-selling- (buyer) acquisition. (3) The overall inter-annual variation of the crime shows strong volatility, which can be divided into a gradual growth phase, a sharp decline phase and a sharp growth phase, the monthly distribution is high in November. (4) The overall pattern of "high incidence in the east and west and low incidence in the center" is shown in the city scale; in the county scale, the Shuangliu District of Chengdu City and Wanzhou District of Chongqing City are the most common. In microplaces, there are differences in the main places where offences are committed and transacted under different offences. (5) The occurrence of crime is mainly affected by the average annual temperature, total water resources, the state of natural ecosystems and other natural factors, male and female gender ratio, level of education, transport network density, ease of access and other socio-economic and cultural factors; the level of consumption of the population, the rate of natural growth and the combination of other factors have a significant impact on wildlife crime. The integrated crime pattern theory and rational choice theory suggest that by rationally considering multiple factors such as the natural environment (e. g. abundant wildlife resources and hidden habitats), the social environment (e. g. weak regulation, strong market demand or weak public awareness of protection) and their own psychological characteristics (e. g. the relationship between costs and benefits), offenders are more likely to convert their criminal intent into actual action, which will in turn The criminal intent is more likely to be transformed into actual action, thus contributing to the eventual occurrence of the criminal behaviour. © 2024 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

Based on the geographical coordinates of mobile devices, we computed two measures of density of the ambient population and the tourist presence, for work days, weekends, and holidays in 2019. Negative binomial regressions are then estimated to analyse whether these measures are correlated with the risk of robbery, controlling for land use and the characteristics of the social environment. The model reveals that residents’ chances of being exposed to robbery in Barcelona depend on the social relevance and tourism attractiveness of certain places at particular times of the year. Our results disclose two sources of social disorganization as stronger predictors of the occurrence of robbery in Barcelona, respectively linked to structural processes of residential instability and daily and seasonal mobility patterns. On the one hand, we found that the effect of the density of international tourists on the outcome variable is mediated by residential volatility, which is assumed to be associated with housing shortages in neighbourhoods where short-term vacation rentals are widespread. On the other hand, the ability to exert effective social control is significantly undermined in urban areas, where the ambient population and the volume of tourists outnumber the resident population, thus increasing incidents of robbery victimization. The implications of these findings for urban policy and crime prevention in the Catalan capital are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines how sexuality, gender, and severity affect the willingness of third parties to mobilize facets of the criminal justice system in response to witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: An M-Turk online sample of 803 adults in the USA completed a factorial vignette survey. Participants were presented with an incident of intimate partner violence and asked to report how likely they would be to notify police and select jail as punishment for the perpetrator. Results: Results of the study uncover no clear evidence of heteronormative bias. Rather, female victims of IPV garner the most support from third parties. Furthermore, respondents were more likely to favor a jail sentence for male perpetrators. Patterns were amplified in severe incidents. Conclusion: The current study suggests that gender and violence severity, rather than sexuality, are the most salient predictors of the third-party’s decision to notify the police and prefer strong criminal justice punishments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Mobile money financial crime evolves in various forms including account takeover fraud, refund fraud, and fake credentials, which poses challenges in measuring its overall cost using real transaction data. Current machine learning methods struggle due to outdated historical financial data that cannot be used to study emerging fraud patterns. This paper introduces MoMTSim, a virtual mobile money platform developed and calibrated using real mobile money transaction data from Sub-Saharan Africa to refine fraud detection mechanisms. Employing statistical methods, agent-based modeling, and social network analysis, MoMTSim improves fidelity by comparing real and synthetic data using the sum of squared errors (SSE) approach. Our experiments show consistent success in fraud classification using machine learning algorithms inclusive of Random Forest and XGBoost. Simpler models encompassing Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees also exhibit remarkable performance in mobile money fraud classification. This approach aids in studying new fraud scenarios and strengthening financial fraud detection mechanisms using the virtual mobile money platform. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Spatiotemporal data on ambient populations have recently become widely available. Although previous studies have indicated a link between the spatial patterns of crime occurrence and ambient population distribution, more detailed information, such as the population most likely to be victims by gender and age group, could better predict the risk of crime occurrence. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the risk of indecent assault, a typical crime with a high number of young female victims, in southern Kyoto Prefecture. We utilized population distribution by gender and age group at different times of the day. After extracting daily patterns (factors) of the population using non-negative matrix factorization, we statistically modeled the risk of indecent assault using a spatial conditional autoregressive model. The results showed that the model, which considered a spatiotemporal ambient population, demonstrated superior performance during nighttime hours. Furthermore, by interpreting the factors significantly associated with the risk of crime occurrence, the findings provided valuable insights into local crime prevention measures that consider daily temporal changes in the gender and age-group composition of individuals present in a specific area. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This article explores the courtroom behaviour of adherents of the oppositional dissenter wing within the Evangelical Baptist community in the Soviet Union, who faced trials for violating Soviet religious laws between the 1960s and 1980s. The analysis reveals that the accused believers developed a nuanced defence strategy encompassing three core elements: mobilizing support from their fellow believers in courtrooms, constructing communicative patterns that involved drawing prosecutors and judges into theologically driven dialogues about truth, and employing distinctive rhetoric aimed at questioning the legal foundations and legitimacy of Soviet religious policy. The accused Baptists adopted a marked confrontational stance towards state officials in charge of criminal prosecutions and trials, striving to overcome them in argument. Ultimately, the courtrooms became a platform for them to voice and promote their faith-based views on state politics and freedom. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - We investigate the spatial decision-making of graffiti writers when selecting target locations, examining how street segment characteristics influence exposure. Extending the rational choice perspective to expressive offending, we collected data through Systematic Social Observation in Ghent’s city center in November 2017, covering 12,655 graffiti instances across 2,233 street segments. The SSO involved counting graffiti items and public facilities likely to attract crowds, and measuring street network centrality. Conditional logit models assessed the impact of these characteristics on graffiti location choices. Results show that street network centrality and the presence of bars, night shops, residential units, and schools significantly increased graffiti writers’ preferences. Our findings suggest that graffiti writers aim to maximize exposure, highlighting the rational choice perspective’s relevance for expressive offending. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) mainly rely on sensor data and are anticipated to transform the transportation sector. The abnormal sensor readings generated by malicious cyberattacks or defective vehicle sensors can result in deadly crashes. This paper proposes a Sensor Attack Detection and Classification (SADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment to examine the cybersecurity concern for AVs against sensor attacks. The SADC framework employs GPS and LiDAR sensor attack detectors and the Pattern-based Attack Classification (PAC) algorithm. It combats new-age cyberattacks and provides an accurate sensor attack detection and classification mechanism in AVs. A protocol-based attack detection scheme in SADC is developed to identify the abnormal source sensor based on the detector’s results. The PAC algorithm classifies malicious sensors by analyzing different strategies: instant, constant, bias, and gradual drift. The results show that the SADC framework has a 0.98% higher accuracy than the existing counterparts in detecting attacks and classifying them efficiently.. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This article studies legitimate businesses confiscated from mafia groups in Italy to assess whether mafia investment patterns across industries depend on the characteristics of the geographical environment in which infiltrated firms operate. We carry out a spatial regression analysis of more than 1700 firms, with special emphasis on restaurants/hotels and construction, confiscated from mafia groups in Italy against a set of variables related to the social and criminal environment (with a special emphasis on mafia presence) after controlling for the local business structure and the economic/financial composition of the areas. Ceteris paribus, mafia investments in the construction industry are greater in regions with a higher level of mafia presence, infiltration of public administration and more protected markets; while investments in bars, restaurants and hotels are greater in areas characterized by less rooted mafia presence, higher violence, higher trade openness and cash intensity. The results suggest that mafia investments in construction can benefit from the opportunities offered by grip on the territory and on the public administration; and those in restaurants by concealment drivers, such as money laundering. This article contributes to the understanding of the geography of mafia economy and of the mobility of mafia groups beyond territories of origin, by highlighting the possible instrumental use of legitimate businesses, and the relationship between mafias’ migration and infiltration mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Prior research has emphasized the interconnection between community structure, civil society activism, and crime. Yet, the statistical association between crime and block clubs, a key element in local networks of voluntary associations and mutual self-help, has not been previously examined in the literature. We collected cross-sectional data on block clubs and crime in Chicago, Illinois, and estimated a set of negative binomial and quantile regression models, while controlling for social disorganization, nearby block club and crime levels, residential population and area size. We found that block clubs are positively associated with both violent and property crime, and that the presence of nearby block clubs is associated with lower crime in communities that have disproportionately high levels of crime. The history of block club organizing in the city informs our Transplant Hypothesis: block clubs are transplanted in communities that have high crime levels. Fostering block clubs in communities may enhance community organization, spur the development of informal social control, and institutionalize mobilization of resources to fight future crime. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Along with the growing market of mobile advertising, click farm that leverages large-scale fake devices to conduct ad fraud is becoming a major threats against mobile advertising. These click farms evolve to mimic the usage patterns of normal users, which makes traditional rule-based detection methods unable to tackle with the new threats. To defeat these attacks, machine leaning-based (ML-based) approaches are adopted as a data driven method to detect invalid traffic from click farms by both industry and academia. However, the vulnerability of ML-based detection methods is still an open problem under the adversarial situation. In this study, we present a first study on the poisoning attack in ML-based ad fraud detection. By injecting poison samples to the training set, we demonstrate the effectiveness and concealment of the poisoning attacks under two machine learning models, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We conduct experiments with a real-world data set, the results show that the poisoning attack can achieve 0.85 and 0.91 attack success rate for GBDT and DNNs respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - With potential disruptions caused by extreme weather events or cyber-attacks, microgrids can sustain critical services without relying on the utility grid as they offer flexible and resilient electric energy locally. This can be enabled by complete observability of the distributed network through reliable wireless communication. Communication performance metrics such as latency, reliability, and throughput need to be analyzed to understand available resilient technologies for various applications of a Distributed Information System (DIS). This paper evaluates the efficiency of 5G communication for time-sensitive applications such as coordinated under-frequency load shedding and cyber-attack detection during the island operation. The 5G communication is modeled that acts as the key factor for enhancing resiliency, monitoring microgrid dynamics, and detecting cyberattacks, and is tested on an IEEE 13-node system. The analysis based on data traffic patterns and available radio channel conditions assesses the need and feasibility of the implementation of 5G communication for the DIS. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The timely identification of potential criminal travel routes of key surveillance individuals is a crucial research focus for public security early warning systems. Current studies often concentrate on the travel patterns and destination preferences of criminals, but there is a lack of research from the criminals' perspective, considering the built environment and road network structure to analyze their criminal travel routes. To address this gap, a spatiotemporal analysis approach is proposed, considering criminals' cognition of concealment. Based on the principles of criminal psychology and rational choice theory, this paper categorizes the travel patterns of criminals under the cognition of concealment into two principles: "the Principle of Minimal Exposure Risk" and "the Principle of Minimal Travel Cost". Firstly, the urban perceptual elements within a criminal's perceptual range, including safety and risk perception elements that bring exposure risks, are calculated and introduced into the choice degree model. The "Criminal Choice Degree of Roads" is proposed to measure the optimal local roads within a criminal's perceptual range. Next, using the "Length of the Route Already Traveled" as the cost function and the "Criminal Choice Degree of Roads" within the perceptual range as the heuristic function, an improved heuristic algorithm is employed to calculate the overall optimal criminal travel route. Finally, from the perspective of crime prevention and control, experiments are conducted to analyze the distribution of urban road choice degrees and the criminal travel routes of key personnel. By comparing the routes obtained by this method with those derived from existing methods and actual criminal travel routes, it is shown that the routes calculated by this proposed method are more reasonable. They are more likely to be chosen by criminals for concealment and have relatively short travel distances, without long-term exposure in public areas. The routes, in terms of distance, travel time, and the urban perceptual elements they pass through, are closer to the actual travel behaviors of criminals, verifying the rationality of this method. The research conclusion provides decision support for public security early warning efforts, emphasizing the importance of balancing travel distance and exposure risk when monitoring key personnel, and the need to allocate resources based on the distribution of urban perceptual elements and road networks to enable timely and accurate crime prevention and interception. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - This study assesses patterns of victimisation and safety perceptions among passengers using railway stations across neighbouring municipalities in Sweden. Exploratory data analysis and logistic regression models underlie the methodology of the study, which shows that the geography of passengers’ victimisation differs from the geographical patterns found for the perception of safety. Findings show that passengers’ safety perceptions are more affected by the physical and social characteristics of transit environments than passengers’ victimisation. Yet, for those who have reduced mobility, the station affects the likelihood of their being victimised. Lack of staff and poor maintenance of the station are two significant attributes associated with the lower levels of safety perceived by passengers as well as levels of crime and panhandling at both the station and on the way to it. Compared with all passengers, women, but in particular those who identify as LGBTQI+ /Non-binary/Other, run a higher likelihood of feeling less safe. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly altered socio-economic activities, human behaviors, and crime patterns. However, less is known about how the pandemic and associated restrictions affected cyber-enabled and traditional fraud. Here, we conducted a retrospective analysis using police-recorded crime data in the UK to examine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and changes in human activity on fraud. Results indicate that following the onset of the lockdown, the number of recorded fraud cases increased by 28.5%, contrasting with traditional property crimes, which dropped by 28.1%. However, the lockdown did not have a significant impact on the long-term trend of fraud. With the lifting of restrictions, fraud gradually regressed to levels approaching those before the pandemic. By inspecting the effects of different government responses and changes in population mobility on various types of fraud, we found that more stringent restrictions were associated with larger increases in most types of cyber-enabled fraud, except for those that rely on offline activities, whereas the impact on traditional fraud was mixed and contingent upon specific opportunity structures. These findings overall align with the assumptions of routine activity theory and provide clear support for its applicability in fraud and cybercrime. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: The detection of explosives in crime scene investigations is critical for forensic science. This study explores the application of laser desorption (LD) ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as a novel method for this purpose utilising a new IMS prototype developed by MaSaTECH. Methods: The LD sampling technique employs a laser diode module to vaporise explosive traces on surfaces, allowing immediate analysis by IMS without sample preparation. Chemometric approaches, including multivariate data analysis, were utilised for data processing and interpretation, including pre-processing of raw IMS plasmagrams and various pattern recognition techniques, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVMs). Results: The IMS prototype was validated through experiments with pure explosives (TNT, RDX, PETN) and explosive products (SEMTEX 1A, C4) on different materials. The study found that the pre-processing method significantly impacts classification accuracy, with the PCA-LDA model demonstrating the best performance for real-world applications. Conclusions: The LD-IMS prototype, coupled with effective chemometric techniques, presents a promising methodology for the detection of explosives in forensic investigations, enhancing the reliability of field applications. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - This study introduces a groundbreaking hybrid deep learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored to improve the security of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging processes in the context of computer-aided mobility solutions for smart urban transportation. The proposed system ingeniously integrates XGBoost and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technologies, leveraging their combined strengths to fortify the resilience of EV charging infrastructure. In response to the demand for transparency in decision-making, our approach incorporates Explainable AI Techniques, specifically employing Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. This not only enables the IDS to identify anomalous behavior but also provides clear insights into the features influencing the detection process. The transparency achieved is pivotal for fostering stakeholder trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and facilitating well-informed decision-making within the dynamic landscape of smart urban transportation. A sophisticated mechanism is implemented to enable the model to autonomously adjust and learn from evolving charging patterns over time. This adaptive capability ensures the IDS remains effective in the face of changing charging behaviors, contributing to the resilience of the overall smart urban transportation system. This research not only propels the field of cybersecurity in smart urban transportation but also establishes a robust framework for the development of intelligent systems. These systems play a critical role in securing essential processes while providing interpretable insights for stakeholders in the realm of computer-aided mobility solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cybercrime is a complex human behavior and social phenomenon. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered socioeconomic activities, potentially causing changes in crime patterns. However, there has been limited research on how the interaction between the pandemic and socioeconomic factors affects cybercrime. Here we explore the spatiotemporal patterns of police-recorded cybercrime, including fraud and cyber-dependent crime, and employ a machine learning approach to assess the correlation of various factors on cybercrimes at the level of internal regions and police areas within the United Kingdom. Our results show that fraud and cyber-dependent crime are mainly concentrated in London and the southeast region of England. Moreover, following the implementation of the third national lockdown, these areas experienced a noticeable increase, while changes in other regions were not as pronounced. The spatial autocorrelation analysis further suggests that there are significant spatial heterogeneities among regions, with spatiotemporal hotspots centered around London and cold spots mainly concentrated in the northeast of England. Additionally, we found that the identified patterns of fraud and cyber-dependent crime are primarily associated with socioeconomic factors, followed by government containment measures and mobility factors. These findings can help law enforcement and regulatory agencies better understand the social-environmental factors contributing to the prevalence of cybercrime within those areas. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Individuals with disabilities constitute a vulnerable heterogeneous group of travellers in public transport. The present study aims to investigate victimisation and perceived safety patterns among train travellers with disabilities (asthma/allergy, motion sickness, depression/anxiety, and reduced mobility). Exploratory data analysis and logistic regression were used to analyse the data coming from a sample of railway travellers across 28 municipalities in Sweden (N = 3374). Individuals with disabilities are more likely to be victimised in transit than those with no disability and declared feeling more unsafe than the rest of the travellers, especially if they had been previously victimised. Like other passengers, individuals with disabilities complain about aggressive panhandling, sexual harassment, the presence of intoxicated people, and a lack of staff. Including disability groups and their special needs in planning is essential to make public transportation safer and more inclusive. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the prevalence of cybercrimes related to video content, including the distribution of illegal videos and the sharing of copyrighted material. This has led to the growing importance of identifying the source of video files to trace the owner of the files involved in the incident or identify the distributor. Previous research has concentrated on revealing the device (brand and/or model) that “originally” created a video file. This has been achieved by analysing the pattern noise generated by the image sensor in the camera, the storage structural features of the file, and the metadata patterns. However, due to the widespread use of mobile environments, instant messaging applications (IMAs) such as Telegram and Wire have been utilized to share illegal videos, which can result in the loss of information from the original file due to re-encoding at the application level, depending on the transmission settings. Consequently, it is necessary to extend the scope of existing research to identify the various applications that are capable of re-encoding video files in transit. Furthermore, it is essential to determine whether there are features that can be leveraged to distinguish them from the source identification perspective. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based methodology for classifying the source application by extracting various features stored in the storage format and internal metadata of video files. To conduct this study, we analyzed 16 IMAs that are widely used in mobile environments and generated a total of 1974 sample videos, taking into account both the transmission options and encoding settings offered by each IMA. The training and testing results on this dataset indicate that the ExtraTrees model achieved an identification accuracy of approximately 99.96 %. Furthermore, we developed a proof-of-concept tool based on the proposed method, which extracts the suggested features from videos and queries a pre-trained model. This tool is released as open-source software for the community. © 2024

AB  - Fingerprints are unique patterns used as biometric keys because they allow an individual to be unambiguously identified, making their application in the forensic field a common practice. The design of a system that can match the details of different images is still an open problem, especially when applied to large databases or, to real-time applications in forensic scenarios using mobile devices. Fingerprints collected at a crime scene are often manually processed to find those that are relevant to solving the crime. This work proposes an efficient methodology that can be applied in real time to reduce the manual work in crime scene investigations that consumes time and human resources. The proposed methodology includes four steps: (i) image pre-processing using oriented Gabor filters; (ii) the extraction of minutiae using a variant of the Crossing Numbers method which include a novel ROI definition through convex hull and erosion followed by replacing two or more very close minutiae with an average minutiae; (iii) the creation of a model that represents each minutia through the characteristics of a set of polygons including neighboring minutiae; (iv) the individual search of a match for each minutia in different images using metrics on the absolute and relative errors. While in the literature most methodologies look to validate the entire fingerprint model, connecting the minutiae or using minutiae triplets, we validate each minutia individually using n-vertex polygons whose vertices are neighbor minutiae that surround the reference. Our method also reveals robustness against false minutiae since several polygons are used to represent the same minutia, there is a possibility that even if there are false minutia, the true polygon is present and identified; in addition, our method is immune to rotations and translations. The results show that the proposed methodology can be applied in real time in standard hardware implementation, with images of arbitrary orientations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Cybercrimes targeting mobile devices are on the rise, with vishing and smishing attacks being particularly prevalent. These attacks exploit social engineering techniques to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information or engaging in unintended actions. To counter this evolving threat landscape, this research proposes a pioneering methodology rooted in voice feature analysis. By distinguishing between human and robotic voices, this approach aims to discern legitimate calls from potential scams, thereby mitigating the associated financial losses and reputational damage. The research delves into the intricacies of voice feature analysis, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to extract and analyze audio attributes such as pitch, volume, and temporal patterns. The ultimate objective is to create a binary classification model that accurately differentiates between human voice calls and robocalls, incorporating a comprehensive dataset comprising actual call recordings and synthesized scenarios. This research advances beyond conventional practices by championing a holistic analysis of both human and robocalls, contrary to the prevalent assumption of robocalls exclusively constituting scams. The application of various audio features, coupled with nuanced weightage allocation, enhances the model's discernment capabilities. The resultant binary classifier is an exemplar of the innovative fusion of technology and human expertise. In conclusion, this research introduces a novel dimension to the combat against vishing and smishing attacks, with a robust voice feature analysis methodology capable of accurately identifying human and robotic voices. By effectively distinguishing legitimate calls from potential threats, this approach presents a promising avenue for safeguarding individuals and organizations against the far-reaching consequences of cybercrimes. The comprehensive analysis, validation, and insights presented in this paper contribute significantly to the field of cybersecurity and voicebased communication analysis.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The problem of missing persons is a major global challenge, which causes serious harm to their families and societies. For this study, we collected 9,193 U.S. missing-persons records for the years 1996-2021 from the Doe Network platform. We used mathematical statistics and Moran's I index to analyze the sociodemographic characteristics, spatio-temporal distribution and its evolution patterns. Then the geodetector was applied to conduct an in-depth analysis of the influencing factors in socio-cultural, economic and demographic aspects. Based on above findings, a sociological theory of the formation mechanism of the missing-person phenomenon in the United States was proposed. Major findings included: (1) With age increasing, the number of missing persons initially increased and then dropped gradually. The highest missing rate was found among adolescents (13-18 years old) and adults (19-59 years old). Although more males than females were reported missing, the high-incidence period of males lagged slightly behind that of females. The high missing rate among adolescent females was linked to sexual crimes, including sex trafficking and rape, while that of adult men tended to be caused by family discord or debt problems. Among racial groups, black people faced the greatest risk of going missing. (2) From 1996, the number of missing-person incidents initially showed a wave upward trended and then fell sharply, after peaking in 2017, because of a series of immigration regulations. In 2020, it declined dramatically again, due to COVID-19. Influenced by the temperature, school holidays, and festivals, most people were reported missing during the months of June, August, and December. Only few missing incidents happened between February and April. (3) Spatially, at the state level, the missing population distribution decreased from the coastal border area to the inland area; over time, areas with a great number of missing-person incidents advanced simultaneously from the eastern and western coastal areas and the southern US-Mexico border to US inland areas. At the county level, they were concentrated on the edge and scattered internally. (4) Missing-person incidents were caused by the interaction of multiple factors; regional population mobility, fertility rate, and the number of vulnerable people had a positive impact on numbers of missing people, while per capital GDP had a negative impact. The power of population-based environmental factors was significantly enhanced after be interacted with social and economic factors, on explaining the missing-person spatial distribution, all of which were above 80%. (5) The underlying mechanism of missing-person incidents could be understood from the perspective of "social anomie". In other words, the disconnect between social goals and means led to social anomie, which then induced deviant behavior, including abduction, murder, and running away from home, increasing the likelihood of missing-person incidents. Finally, we offered suggestions for disappearance prevention and further study directions. The findings provided a basic understanding of the missing-person phenomenon, contributing to global scientific information, which could aid in preventing missing-person incidents. © Starobulgarska Literatura 2022.

AB  - Expeditious growth in e-commerce has emerged in an increasing number of online shopping societies. These shoppers rely on credit cards as a payment method or use a mobile wallet for their purchases. Thus, credit cards have become the main payment method in the e-world. Given the many transactions that occur daily, criminals propose tremendous opportunities to find different ways of attacking and stealing credit card information. Fraudulent credit card transactions are a serious business issue. These types of scams can result in significant economic and personal losses. As a result, businesses are increasingly devoted to developing new ideas and methods for detecting and preventing fraud, as well as acquiring their customer's trust and protecting their privacy. In recent years, learning algorithms have emerged as important in research fields aimed at developing solutions to this issue. In this paper, the proposed framework will develop a two-stage anomaly and fraud detection model that uses a strengthened anomaly clustering algorithm in the first stage to find fraud patterns in transactions. The second stage uses a learning classifier to detect fraud in transactions based on fraud patterns and clients' spending behavior. The transactions will be well balanced using hybrid sampling techniques to enhance the performance of the model. This framework also aims to optimize the learning classifier model, which will improve other existing models in terms of performance, computation time, and accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Human trafficking is one of the most rapidly increasing forms of transnational crime. Globally, an estimated 25 million adults and children are subjected to modern slavery or human trafficking. In India, approximately 7 thousand cases of human trafficking have been reported as of 2021 (ILO, 2022). The present study aims to contextualize the changing levels and patterns of human trafficking by integrating demographic and spatial dimensions by considering the dynamics of human trafficking with space, population, time, and circumstances in India. The study uses information from human trafficking cases reported by police records data accessed from Indiastat (www.Indiastat.com), an online repository supervised by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India. The present study deploys descriptive statistical techniques to accomplish the objectives, as the descriptive design provides a detailed and accurate data representation. Location quotient (LQ) mapping is used to detect the degree of victimization by human trafficking for 2021. The volume of human trafficking remained stagnant (above five thousand) until 2017, but it decreased in 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown restricting human mobility. Forced labor (43%) and sexual exploitation (33%) are the leading causes of trafficking in India. Rajasthan (80.8%) male victims and Maharashtra (94.0%) female victims reported the highest reported cases of human trafficking by gender. The highest concentration of human trafficking concerning its population is in Goa LQ value: 8.18). Child rights protection measures and robust anti-trafficking policies should be established as major policy measures for the Indian government. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, a conventional camera modified to capture multispectral images, has been used to locate latent forensic traces with a smart combination of wavelength filters, capturing angle, and illumination sources. There are commercial multispectral capture devices adapted to the specific tasks of the police, but due to their high cost and operation not well adapted to the field work in a crime scene, they are not currently used by forensic units. In our work, we have used a digital SLR camera modified to obtain a nominal sensitivity beyond the visible spectrum. The goal is to obtain forensic evidences from a crime scene using the multispectral camera by an expert in the field knowing which wavelength filters and correct illumination sources should be used, making visible latent evidences hidden from the human-eye. In this paper, we show a procedure to retrieve from latent forensic traces, showing the validity of the system in different real cases (blood stains, hidden/erased tattoos, unlocking patterns on mobile devices). This work opens the possibility of applying multispectral inspections in the forensic field specially for operational units for the location of latent through non-invasive optical procedures. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Urban environments continuously generate larger and larger volumes of data, whose analysis can provide descriptive and predictive models as valuable support to inspire and develop data-driven Smart City applications. To this aim, Big data analysis and machine learning algorithms can play a fundamental role to bring improvements in city policies and urban issues. This paper introduces how Big Data analysis can be exploited to design and develop data-driven smart city services, and provides an overview on the most important Smart City applications, grouped in several categories. Then, it presents three real-case studies showing how data analysis methodologies can provide innovative solutions to deal with smart city issues. The first one is an approach for spatio-temporal crime forecasting (tested on Chicago crime data), the second one is methodology to discover mobility hotsposts and trajectory patterns from GPS data (tested on Beijing taxi traces), the third one is an approach to discover predictive epidemic patterns from mobility and infection data (tested on real COVID-19 data). The presented real-world cases prove that data analytics models can effectively support city managers in tackling smart city challenges and improving urban applications. Copyright © 2023 Cesario.

AB  - POI recommendation is significant for discovering attractive locations, crime prediction, and smart city construction. Most existing methods only consider the fixed time and space between successive check-in points when capturing sequential patterns from trajectory history. However, single granularity is inadequate to mine the spatial-temporal influence on sequential patterns in sparse and incomplete check-in data. Besides, they neglect the relevance between non-adjacent check-ins and fail to fully exploit factors for the correlation mining. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel model for the next POI recommendation via multi-granularity context and correlation. It focuses on exploring vital factors for modeling effective spatial-temporal contexts and mining potential correlations among check-ins. Specifically, for context modeling, we explore effective spatial-temporal contexts to learn mobility patterns locally and globally by introducing hierarchical regions and slots. For correlation modeling, we only focus on the geographical influence. We employ a spatial-aware function to measure the correlations among check-ins to find the predictive ones for the recommendation. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets indicate that our MGCOCO consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Much research has documented the contagiousness of violence. Some of this work has focused on contagiousness as operationalized by the spread across geographical space, while other work has examined the spread within social networks. While the latter body of work struggles with incomplete network data, the former constitutes a theoretical mismatch with how violence should spread. Theory instead strongly suggests that violence contagion should diffuse through everyday mobility networks rather than just adjacently through geographical space. Beyond contagion itself, I argue that neighborhoods connected through mobility networks should serve as useful short-term sensors in predicting imminent violence because these sets of residents tend to experience shared environmental exposures, which may induce synchrony in the likelihood of violence. I explore this topic and these relationships using violent crime data from the three largest U.S. cities: New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Using two-way fixed effects models, I test whether or not violence in mobility-connected alter neighborhoods in the preceding hour predicts violence in an ego neighborhood in the next hour. Across all three jurisdictions, I find that recent violence in the neighborhoods to which a neighborhood is connected through mobility ties can strongly predict that neighborhood’s odds of subsequent violence. Furthermore, spatial proximity has no significant effect on the likelihood of violent crime after controlling for mobility ties. I conclude by arguing that mobility patterns are an important pathway in the prediction of violence. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Introduction: In response to COVID-19, governments imposed various restrictions on movement and activities. According to the routine activity perspective, these should alter where crime occurs. For burglary, greater household occupancy should increase guardianship against residential burglaries, particularly during the day considering factors such as working from home. Conversely, there should be less eyes on the street to protect against non-residential burglaries. Methods: In this paper, we test these expectations using a spatio-temporal model with crime and Google Community Mobility data. Results: As expected, burglary declined during the pandemic and restrictions. Different types of burglary were, however, affected differently but largely consistent with theoretical expectation. Residential and attempted residential burglaries both decreased significantly. This was particularly the case during the day for completed residential burglaries. Moreover, while changes were coincident with the timing and relaxation of restrictions, they were better explained by fluctuations in household occupancy. However, while there were significant decreases in non-residential and attempted non-residential burglary, these did not appear to be related to changes to activity patterns, but rather the lockdown phase. Conclusions: From a theoretical perspective, the results generally provide further support for routine activity perspective. From a practical perspective, they suggest considerations for anticipating future burglary trends. © 2022

AB  - Harmful alcohol use is an important risk factor for premature mortality and morbidity and associated with increased HIV risk and lower uptake of and adherence to HIV interventions. This study aimed to assess the extent of harmful alcohol use and associated socio-structural vulnerability factors among female sex workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a key population in the HIV epidemic. Data from a study of female sex workers initiating pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) recruited through respondent driven sampling were used. We assessed harmful alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) defined as having an AUDIT score ≥ 16. Associations between harmful alcohol use and socio-structural factors were assessed using logistic regression with marginal standardization. Of the 470 women recruited, more than one third (37.3%) had a drinking pattern suggestive of harmful alcohol use. Such use was independently associated with sex work-related mobility (aPR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11–1.61), arrest/incarceration (aPR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.27–1.84) and gender-based violence (aPR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.56). The high prevalence of harmful alcohol use and the interconnectedness with socio-structural factors indicate a need for a holistic programmatic approach to health for female sex workers. Programming should not solely direct attention to individual behavior but also include strategies aiming to address socio-structural vulnerabilities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As the spatial carrier of people's daily behaviors, the street network and behaviors therein constitute the main spatial environment of street network, which affects criminal behavior. Previous studies have shown that there are frequent cases of robberies and thefts in the streets, and the street network pattern and routine activity subjects are both related to crime. However, there are few in-depth explorations of such a relationship. Based on the police patrol area unit of the original DP District of HS City, this paper has adopted spatial analysis and statistical analysis methods to analyze the road network data, demographic data, mobile phone signaling data and other relevant data in order to explore the relationship between crime and street morphological characteristics including geometric and topological form, the relationship between crime and routine activity subjects including dynamic population and static population, and the impact of the street network on robberies and thefts. The results have shown that the factors affecting thefts and robberies in the street network are quite different. The factors affecting the theft crime are more complex. "X-cell" street network, road network density, road network permeability of low-speed traffic, static population density and dynamic population density all have an important impact on thefts. Only the branch density has a negative effect, and the rest of the factors have a positive effect. "T-cell" street network, density of actual residents and migrants in static population are related to robberies. But the street network pattern has not shown a significant correlation with robberies. In general, the street networks with more main roads, better accessibility, higher population density, and higher population mobility are prone to thefts. The street networks with many migrants are prone to the robberies. In addition, the findings of this study can also make certain extensions to the crime pattern theory. Since the accessibility of street network often brings risks, it is proposed at the end of the paper that it is imperative to consider how to reduce the crime risks as much as possible by regulating or improving the overall spatial environment of street network during the planning and construction of a safe street network environment in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - The disorders of urban micro-built and social environments ("urban microenvironment", UME in short) are key factors that affect the spatial and temporal pattern and formation mechanism of theft, as well as the opportunity, cost and means of crime. To understand the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of their impact on theft is the core content of CPTED and crime geography. This paper focuses on the progress on the link between UME and theft, systematically sorts out the characteristics of UME that affect the spatio-temporal differentiation of theft, and summarizes the measurements of UME. Overall, four issues need to be addressed urgently: (1) At present, the ambient population variables calculated by using mobile phone data are mainly population size and mobility, while the micro-social environment has not been precisely depicted by population′s demographic attributes and social regularity. (2) There is a lack of systematic research on the integration of micro-social and built environment, which may lead to pseudo-correlation or irrelevance. (3) The localized empirical research of Western criminological theories is not sufficient, and the theoretical connotation and concept are often difficult to be operated locally. The local knowledge generated by Chinese empirical research is somewhat complementary and challenging to Western criminological theories, but needs to be further "conceptualized internationally". (4) Street view has been used for virtual audit of micro-built environment, but randomly selecting audit sites lacks pertinence, because it paid no heed to the spatial variation of micro-social environment. Four avenues can be proposed for future research: (1) Cooperating with the public security department, employing sensitive data to measure micro-scale population attributes and social regularity, expanding the extension of the concept of "population at risk", and accurately reflecting the micro-social environment. Conducting theoretical and policy-oriented empirical research. (2) Coupling micro-social and micro-built environment, and analyzing the inter-embedding basis and coupling path of the two micro-environments from the multidimensional theoretical levels of society, environment, and behavior. Using "big" data to depict "micro" environment, and exploring the conditional interaction mechanism and scale dependence between the UME and theft. (3) Grasping the theoretical connotation of criminology, taking into account the social context of Chinese cities, and developing new possibilities for the local operationalization of the core concept of criminological theories. (4) Developing remote, virtual, automated and intelligent built environment observation methods based on street view, and paying attention to targeted sampling and systematic integration research. © 2022, Science Press.

An automated pattern recognition decentralizes and distributes customized specific data. Machine learning, originated from artificial intelligence is primarily related to recognition of behavior patterns. Methods like knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining focus on unsupervised approaches and are widely used in business and climatic weather applications. Blockchain addresses data-security concerns and builds trust by creating distributed ledger. Theft, willful fraud, software and hardware are considered by blockchain in data protection. Blockchain has greater significant feature as it makes the secure data access without enabling the central management entity. Two design features of blockchain technology help in this task. Recommended customer data pattern recognition technique using blockchain may eliminate all these problems. Two kinds of cryptographic algorithms employed in blockchain are asymmetric-key algorithms and hash functions. The current study analyzes the asymmetric cryptography approach along with key pair which supports in system security. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier techniques consider both old customers and new customers as stable. The predictive model aids in identifying customers at churn risk in the telecommunication system. Existing proactive methods are unable to explain difficulties in customer interaction understanding and meeting their genuine needs. The proposed model organizes the customer situation and designs a customer proactive re-engagement over mobile-based telecommunication systems. Performance measures like churn prediction, classifier, confusion matrix, machine learning in the telecommunication system are used to evaluate and validate the results. © 2022

AB  - Far-right movements in different forms are gaining momentum around the world, especially in Europe and the United States. Though not new, the ideology appears to be manifesting in forms that are challenging to police or manage by security entities. This chapter explores the far-right movements and their intended goal which often makes mobilisation and violence inevitable and a common occurrence in Europe. It further reviews far-right activities in the onset and immediate global response to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak with the aim to identify patterns, target groups, and impacts of COVID-19 on far-right activities in Europe. A conceptual review of data, publications, and reports on far-right movements since 2020 points to overlapping interactions between hate crime and extreme violence following a period of far-right online mobilisation, driven by the mission to deliver varied forms of national outcomes. Findings reveal a correlation between COVID-19 and far-right movements, especially mobilisation for the ideology using different online platforms. Though less than anticipated attacks were carried out during the pandemic, the commitment to mobilise more adherents to the movements using COVID-19-specific conspiracies provides strong links geared towards events that could endanger the security and safety of the public. The implications for public security as a whole, and for European Union security policy and counter-terrorism, strategies are evaluated to highlight the limitations of current policy and strategies in preventing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 which appears to be a game-changing event in the world and for the far-right movements which used the pandemic to innovate. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Erman Akilli, Burak Güneş and Ahmet Gökbel.

AB  - The reliability of the dataset is an essential factor for solving classification problems. Data is required for training, testing, classification, and evaluation of the machine learning models. SMS Phishing (Smishing) is a binary classification problem in which messages are categorized as malicious (Smishing) or legitimate (Ham). It is a fraudulent activity in which the attacker sends a malicious text message to the Smartphone user that causes financial or personal loss to the victim. Few research works have been proposed for the identification of smishing messages. According to the literature survey conducted, the smishing dataset is not publicly available yet. Hence, we have composed a smishing dataset that contains smishing messages extracted from different internet sources. We have formulated a dataset of 5971 text messages that contain 638 smishing messages, 489 spam messages, and 4844 ham messages. This SMS Phishing dataset can be used for the extraction of smishing features and classification of text messages using Machine Learning Algorithms. Experimental evaluation of the dataset for smishing message categorization using keyword classification is also presented in this paper. This smishing dataset can be used as a baseline for future research work corresponding to SMS Phishing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on mobility patterns with implications for public safety and crime dynamics in countries across the planet. This paper explores the effect of stay-at-home guidelines on thefts and robberies at the neighborhood level in a Latin American city. We exploit neighborhood heterogeneity in the ability of working adults to comply with stay-at-home recommendations and use difference-in-differences and event-study designs to identify the causal effect of COVID-19 mobility restrictions on the monthly number of thefts and robberies reported to police across neighborhoods in Montevideo (Uruguay) in 2020. Our results show that neighborhoods with a higher share of residents with work-from-home jobs experienced a larger reduction in reported thefts in relation to neighborhoods with a lower share of residents with work-from-home jobs. In contrast, both groups of neighborhoods experienced a similar reduction in the number of reported robberies. These findings cast light on opportunity structures for crime but also on how crime during the pandemic has disproportionately affected more vulnerable areas and households. © 2022 Cornell Law School and Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - It has been found that the type of community housing has an important impact on the spatial pattern of burglary in urban areas. However, few scholars have explored the difference of the impact of different housing types in different degrees of population mobility on burglary. This study takes ZG city, a coastal city in southeast China, as a research area. It is based on theories of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, rational choice theory and social disorganization theory. This paper, taking community as the unit of analysis, adopts data of burglary, the sixth national census and Point of Interest (POI). The spatial lagged negative binomial regression method is used to analyze the impact of the interaction between community population mobility and housing types on the spatial pattern of burglary. Among them, the population mobility factors were extracted based on the proportion of migrant population and the proportion of renting houses. The results show that population mobility has a significant positive impact on burglary rate. There is a significant positive effect of the proportion of owner-built housing on the rate of burglary, and the proportion of former public owned housing and commercial housing has a significant inhibitory effect on the burglary rate. In addition, the impact of affordable housing on burglary is not significant. The results of the interaction variables found that the interaction coefficients of population mobility with different types of housing variables are varied. Among them, the interaction of population mobility with self-built housing, affordable housing and former public housing has a significant promoting effect on burglary rate, indicating that the higher the degree of population mobility, the greater the impact of these three types of housing on burglary. Nevertheless, the interaction effect of population mobility and commercial housing is not significant. This study proves that population mobility can further mediate the effects of different types of housing on burglary, and suggests that we should pay attention to the impact of the degree of population mobility in the community where different types of housing are located when discussing the relationship between different types of housing and burglary. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - In recent years, the police intervention strategy “Hot spots policing” has been effective in combating crimes. However, as cities are under the intense pressure of increasing crime and scarce police resources, police patrols are expected to target more accurately at finer geographic units rather than ballpark “hot spot” areas. This study aims to develop an algorithm using geographic information to detect crime patterns at street level, the so-called “hot street”, to further assist the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in capturing crime change and transitive moments efficiently. The algorithm applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique onto street networks, rather than traditional areal units, in one case study borough in London; it then maps the detected crime “hot streets” by crime type. It was found that the algorithm could successfully generate “hot street” maps for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), enabling more effective allocation of police patrolling; and bear enough resilience itself for the Strategic Crime Analysis (SCA) team’s sustainable utilization, by either updating the inputs with latest data or modifying the model parameters (i.e. the kernel function, and the range of spillover). Moreover, this study explores contextual characteristics of crime “hot streets” by applying various regression models, in recognition of the best fitted Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, encompassing eight significant contextual factors with their varied effects on crimes at different streets. Having discussed the impact of lockdown on crime rates, it was apparent that the land-use driven mobility change during lockdown was a fundamental reason for changes in crime. Overall, these research findings have provided evidence and practical suggestions for crime prevention to local governors and policy practitioners, through more optimal urban planning (e.g. Low Traffic Neighborhoods), proactive policing (e.g. in the listed top 10 “Hot Streets” of crime), publicizing of laws and regulations, and installations of security infrastructures (e.g. CCTV cameras and traffic signals). © 2022 Wuhan University.

AB  - Counterfeit poses a serious threat to financial institutions and the global economy. This work introduces machine learning techniques that use image processing, pattern recognition, and classification algorithms to accurately identify false positives. These studies are based on analysis of real banknotes, their security features and counterfeiting techniques. Images of real and fake invoices are carefully recorded to create robust data for training and testing learning models such as neural networks (CNN). Image processing techniques such as edge detection and feature extraction improve the model's detection capabilities. The development model, evaluated in terms of efficiency, is integrated into a user-friendly interface and accepts cash register images as input. This solution aims to contribute to continuous efforts to combat fraud, providing a clear and effective way to protect financial institutions and increase business security.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In cases of digital enrolment via mobile and online services, identity documents (IDs) verification is critical to efficiently detect forgery and therefore build user trust in the digital world. In this paper, we propose a copy-move public dataset, called FMIDV (forged mobile ID video dataset) containing forged IDs with respect to guilloche patterns. Also, we propose two fraud detection models on guilloche patterns of IDs, which are based on contrastive and adversarial learning. In the sequel, each proposed model manages to read the entire ID and to recognize the guilloche pattern to check its similarity to the pattern of an authentic ID. The objective of the similarity check is to validate its authenticity or its rejection. Experiments are conducted on MIDV and FMIDV datasets to analyze and identify the most proper parameters to achieve higher authentication performance.

AB  - Unidentified human remains have historically been investigated nationally by law enforcement authorities. However, this approach is outdated in a globalized world with rapid transportation means, where humans easily move long distances across borders. Cross-border cooperation in solving cold-cases is rare due to political, administrative or technical challenges. It is fundamental to develop new tools to provide rapid and cost-effective leads for international cooperation. In this work, we demonstrate that isotopic measurements are effective screening tools to help identify cold-cases with potential international ramifications. We first complete existing databases of hydrogen and sulfur isotopes in human hair from residents across North America by compiling or analyzing hair from Canada, the United States (US) and Mexico. Using these databases, we develop maps predicting isotope variations in human hair across North America. We demonstrate that both δ2H and δ34S values of human hair are highly predictable and display strong spatial patterns. Multi-isotope analysis combined with dual δ2H and δ34S geographic probability maps provide evidence for international travel in two case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that multi-isotope analysis in bulk hair of deceased border crossers found in the US, close to the Mexico-US border, help trace their last place of residence or travel back to specific regions of Mexico. These findings were validated by the subsequent identification of these individuals through the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, Arizona. In the second case study, we demonstrate that sequential multi-isotope analysis along the hair strands of an unidentified individual found in Canada provides detailed insights into the international mobility of this individual during the last year of life. In both cases, isotope data provide strong leads towards international travel. © 2022 Bataille et al.

AB  - Telecom-network fraud is a complex and diversified social problem, which is related to people's well-being and social stability. With the data of China judicial documents network, using natural language technology of AI, combined with exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial econometric model, this paper systematically and deeply analyzes the spatial pattern and influencing factors of telecom-network fraud in China, based on the perspective of the source of crime. The research showed that: (1) The regional characteristics of the origin of the telecom network fraud are obvious, and the spatial pattern is“More in the north but less in the south, more in the east while less in the west, and more prominent in the middle”. Meanwhile, the spatial spillover effect is different between the south and the north. Hunan is the center of the south, and the spillover effect is outstanding. (2) The spatial choice of criminals is obviously different, the short-distance crime takes precedence over the medium- and long-distance crime, and the proportion of crimes in the province is much higher than that in other provinces. (3) Although telecom- network fraud is characterized by non- contact, but the criminals do not randomly choose the victims, instead they target at special victims. The spatial clustering of the crime occurrence is remarkable. The hot areas of criminal cases and the hot areas where criminals come from are highly overlapping, and the developed coastal cities have also become the hot areas of telecom network fraud. (4) The influencing factors of the spatial pattern of the origin of the telecom network fraud are different. Wage level, urbanization rate, education level, urban environment, urban administrative level have significant impacts on crime, but their mechanisms are different. Based on the macro- scale, this study provides empirical evidence and scientific reference for crime prevention and control. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mobile communications have become a vital domain for criminals and terrorists to exploit vulnerabilities, posing significant threats to public safety and national security. More precisely, they can employ cell site simulators such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers to intercept and monitor mobile communications, enabling eavesdropping, tracking individuals' movements, and potentially coordinating illegal activities while evading detection by law enforcement agencies. To overcome this issue, an innovative approach to detect IMSI catchers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models is proposed. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the developed models process multivariate time series data to distinguish suspicious patterns indicative of IMSI catcher presence. This work compares nine different model architectures based on CNN, LSTM, or a combination of both through a series of case studies. We demonstrate that LSTM-based and Parallel CNNLSTM models outperform other architectures, achieving high precision and recall rates. Then, the best two models are tested with several sequence lengths. The presented models serve as valuable tools, providing a further enhancement to the security of mobile networks. The goal of this research work is to contribute to the broader mission of integrating artificial intelligence within the daily investigative practices of law enforcement agencies.  © 2023 IEEE.

Spreading globally in its contemporary form for almost half a century, graffiti still retains symbolic and social connections to its subcultural origins in 1970s New York. Yet, graffiti is not only an interest of graffiti writers, but of numerous social agents and institutions too, including art dealers, museums, policy makers, academic scholars, journalists, law enforcement agencies and various corporate actors. As a result, the imageries of graffiti writing are bound up with a range of practices, each with its own scope and logic. This chapter taps into some of them. It engages with graffiti as image and practice before proceeding to discuss the suppression and commodification of graffiti writing, as well as the patterns of mobility and permanence in which graffiti often is encapsulated. To this end, the chapter reviews a relatively large (yet far from complete) collection of research, stemming from the humanities, social sciences and (socio)linguistics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Bente A. Svendsen and Rickard Jonsson.

AB  - The story of technology is certainly as old as humanity itself. With the advancement of time, human society has been instrumental in communication technology. Technology has worked in two ways, as a supporting tool for crime as well as a helping tool to identify and investigate the e at the same time. In the last decade, India has seen rapid growth in the field of mobile communication as it is continuously increasing at an exponential rate, the availability of cheap data and availability of economical rate of calling encourages users to make calls easily and this continuous calling within a certain group creates a network considering relationship a parameter. The use of existing models of rapid data mining on mobile phone call logs / call data records (CDR)establishes a new dimension in the field of a user's social behavior. Meanwhile, it makes a possible methodology of suspect detection based on certain attributes i.e., cell phone conversation ratio, calling pattern among users, terrain-basedfacts, etc. In this paper, key areas which have been covered are 'Machine's perception towards prediction of complex social systems and strange behavior of cell phone user' based on data mining techniques applied on call details of cell phone users. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The Bunyavirales order is the largest grouping of RNA viruses, comprising emerging and re-emerging human, plant and animal pathogens. Bunyaviruses have a global distribution and many members of the order are transmitted by arthropods. They have evolved a plethora of mechanisms to manipulate the regulatory processes of the infected cell to facilitate their own replicative cycle, in hosts of disparate phylogenies. Interest in virus-vector interactions is growing rapidly. However, current understanding of tick-borne bunyavirus cellular interaction is heavily biased to studies conducted in mammalian systems. In this short review, we summarise current understandings of how tick-borne bunyaviruses utilise major cellular pathways (innate immunity, apoptosis and RNAi responses) in mammalian or tick cells to facilitate virus replication. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The COVID-19 contingency gave rise to multiple social interactions for which neither governments nor citizens were prepared. The restrictive measures on mobility imposed by the National Government produced a series of changes not only in social dynamics and legal transactions, but also in the criminal context. The purpose of this study is to understand the space-time behavior of theft in the metropolitan area of Pereira, Colombia, and to compare this behavior observed under normal conditions and in times of pandemic. Data were obtained by consulting the Siedco application for the city studied in the 2019-2021 time window. The spatial analysis was performed using the technique known as pattern identification for space-time event networks (Ipree). The empirical evidence observed allows us to conclude that there is a space-time configuration that defines the dynamics of thefts in the city of Pereira and these patterns can be explained from the theory of environmental munificence for crime. © 2023 Policia Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Preparedness for adverse events is critical to building urban resilience to climate-related risks. While most extant studies investigate preparedness patterns based on survey data, this study explores the potential of big digital footprint data (i.e. population visits to points of interest (POI)) to investigate preparedness patterns in the real case of Hurricane Ida (2021). We further investigate income and racial inequality in preparedness by combining the digital footprint data with demographic and socioeconomic data. A clear pattern of preparedness was seen in Louisiana with aggregated visits to grocery stores, gasoline stations, and construction supply dealers increasing by nearly 9%, 12%, and 10% respectively, representing three types of preparedness: survival, mobility planning, and hazard mitigation. Preparedness for Hurricane Ida was not seen in New York and New Jersey states. Inequality analyses for Louisiana across census block groups (CBGs) demonstrate that CBGs with higher income have more (nearly 8% greater) preparedness in visiting gasoline stations, while CBGs with a larger percentage of the white population have more preparedness in visiting grocery stores (nearly 12% more) in the lowest income groups. The results indicate that income and racial inequality differ across different preparedness in terms of visiting different POIs. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Ridesplitting has been widely recognised as a promising mobility mode for sustainable transportation, but its success largely depends on a sufficient number of passengers who are willing to share their rides. To uncover the determinants of willingness to share (WTS), prior studies typically relied on either individual-level survey-based or aggregate-level data-driven methods. To combine the former's strength in capturing individual choice preferences and the latter's advantage in utilising available multi-source big data, this study proposes a big data approach to modelling individual choices between the solo and shared options for each trip. To reconstruct the choice process, we leverage large-scale real-world trip records and propose a learning framework to not only retrieve the trip time and fare of the chosen option (solo or shared), but also impute the likely time and fare of the alternative option. These reconstructed trip attributes are then integrated with the sociodemographic, built environment and traffic features from other data sources. Finally, all these variables are fed into a random coefficient logit model to reveal passengers’ ridesplitting preferences. Through a case study of Manhattan, New York City, we reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of WTS and its determinants. Results show that WTS varies greatly across space and time. The time-fare trade-off is identified as the most essential factor, with the value of time revealed to be about $28-36/h. WTS decreases with longer trip distance/commuting time/distance to the urban centre, lower road speed, and higher speed fluctuation/bus station/crime density, but increases with a higher proportion of middle-class/female/young residents, residential land use and metro station. The proposed methodology can be used to explain and monitor WTS in a cost-effective way, complementing traditional survey-based methods to better design and promote ridesplitting services. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crime fiction, a frequently translated and highly translatable literary genre, has generated perspectives on the global and the local in ways that shape cartographies of world literature. The Indonesian novel 24 Hours with Gaspar by Sabda Armandio is a case study for how specific texts within the genre can serve as points of departure for theorizing cultural geography in an imaginative mode. Analyzing Gaspar through three spatial optics, this paper considers the novel's global influences, the elements that fall into relief as local in translation, and - by attending to patterns of movement and contact that complicate place-based perspectives - the archipelagic qualities of the text. By imagining this alternative conception of literary space, Armandio's novel recasts the contemporary global novel as the product of contact, mobility, and linguistic and material flows rather than sites of static national or regional identity. © Lara Norgaard, 2023.

AB  - In the digital age, many people have used mobile phones, thus, mobile phones are one of the most commonly used crime tools. Users can take security measures to their mobile devices using various authorization methods such as passwords or screen patterns (touch screen security authentication). The used security measures generally make mobile forensic analysis difficult or even impossible. In order to overcome this problem, a novel intelligent pattern lock detector is presented in this research. The proposed lock detector uses transfer learning to extract deep lightweight features, iterative feature chosen function and a shallow classifier. A feature extraction network has been created by using SqueezeNet and MobileNet-V2, which are among the deep learning architectures in this work. Iterative Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (ImRMR) was used for feature selection. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was selected for the classifier. The proposed model has been developed on three image datasets. These datasets are named clean, slightly dirty and medium dirty. 99.75%, 98.55% and 96.50% classification accuracies have been reached on the used three datasets, respectively. The findings clearly denote that the success of the presented deep lightweight features and ImRMR-based detector. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study makes use of a dataset recently collected among young people in Stockholm, Sweden (N = 1122), to investigate the impact of fear on young people’s mobility and precautionary behaviour, after controlling for previous victimization as well as situational characteristics of daily trips. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and logistic regression models underlie the methodology of the study. Previous victimization, especially for sexual crimes, triggers precautionary behaviour among young people using trains and the metro. Signs of poorly maintained transit environments also affect young riders’ mobility patterns, as they state that they avoid particular stations or routes at particular times. Informed by principles of environmental criminology and the theory of fear of crime, the implications of the findings for both theory and practice are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender - Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are utilized to find hostile network connections. This can be accomplished by looking at traffic network activity, but it takes a lot of work. The NIDS heavily utilizes approaches for data extraction and machine learning to find anomalies. In terms of feature selection, NIDS is far more effective. This is accurate since anomaly identification uses a number of time-consuming features. Because of this, the feature selection method influences how long it takes to analyze movement patterns and how clear it is. The goal of the study is to provide NIDS with an attribute selection approach. PSO has been used for that purpose. The Network Intrusion Detection System that is being developed will be able to identify any malicious activity in the network or any unusual behavior in the network, allowing the identification of the illegal activities and safeguarding the enormous amounts of confidential data belonging to the customers from being compromised. In the research, datasets were produced utilising both a network infrastructure and a simulation network. Wireshark is used to gather data packets whereas Cisco Packet Tracer is used to build a network in a simulated environment. Additionally, a physical network consisting of six node MCUs connected to a laptop and a mobile hotspot, has been built and communication packets are being recorded using the Wireshark tool. To train several machine learning models, all the datasets that were gathered—created datasets from our own studies as well as some common datasets like NSDL and UNSW acquired from Kaggle—were employed. Additionally, PSO, which is an optimization method, has been used with these ML algorithms for feature selection. In the research, KNN, decision trees, and ANN have all been combined with PSO for a specific case study. And it was found demonstrated the classification methods PSO + ANN outperformed PSO + KNN and PSO + DT in this case study. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - This chapter describes the use of semiotic practices on social media to create community formations, based on examples of the Vietnamese diaspora in the UK mobilising collective action in response to crises in 2020. It argues that collective responses to crises can be a way for diasporas to actively make themselves visible, allowing them to positively shape external perceptions instead of being forced into a negative form of visibility through, in the case of the Vietnamese, associations with crime, human trafficking and illegal migration. Data are drawn from Facebook pages by and for Vietnamese people in the UK, and specifically how they were used as platforms to mobilise philanthropic action. The analysis will show how semiotic practices can simultaneously index multiple layers of social meanings and that differential access to the resources required for participation in those practices leads to complex patterns of inclusion and exclusion. Despite the different levels of participation in those practices, and thus different degrees of belonging, the participants are shown to be united around a shared orientation around the events of the crisis and the philanthropic response. This imagined simultaneous experience of a crisis in turn serves to temporarily transcend multiple internal divisions for a collective response. © 2023 Julia Gspandl, Christina Korb, Angelika Heiling, Elizabeth J.

AB  - The increasing use of computer technologies to perform everyday activities simplifies living, but brings the underlying cybersecurity concern to the fore. Due to the accessibility of smartphones, many teenagers are 'online' for significant hours in a day. Many middle and high school students have been victims of a cybercrime through online activities. Additionally, various incidents of Internet fraud have been reported where teenagers are persuaded to buy games, music, and videos without realizing they are falling for a scam or disclosing their credit card information. Studies have shown that implementing a successful security awareness camp is crucial in boosting cybersecurity and attracting talent to this domain. This paper discusses our efforts on creating smartphone apps in the context of cyber-security to encourage safe use of apps and raise awareness among teenagers. The strategy used is to develop apps with the intention of closing security gaps. By doing this, teenagers gain a wealth of information about cybersecurity. This work aims to develop students' problem-solving skills and create a cybersecurity mindset for dealing with real-world cybersecurity-related problems such as malware or phishing assaults and to promote interest in cybersecurity careers among high school students utilizing smartphone-based interactive learning modules. We also examine gender-specific patterns and evaluate whether students' cybersecurity problem-solving skills have improved due to this novel intervention.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study analyses the influence of temporal factors on the dynamics of residential burglaries in the city of Cuiabá. For this, it uses routine activity and rational choice theories as theoretical reference. Despite analysing the distribution of such crimes by year, month, season, day of the week and period of the day, the statistical results only show that violent residential burglaries are more concentrated at night. However, the research indicates that residential burglaries have specific time patterns, which is of great importance to support public security policies in Cuiabá, which could adopt, for example, varied prevention strategies for different periods of the day and year. © 2023 Presses Universitaires du Septentrion.

AB  - The ambient population has been regarded as an important indicator for analyzing or predicting thefts. However, the literature has taken it as a homogenous group and seldom explored the varied impacts of different kinds of ambient populations on thefts. To fill this gap, supported by mobile phone trajectory data, this research investigated the relationship between ambient populations of different social groups and theft in a major city in China. With the control variables of motivated offenders and guardianship, spatial-lag negative binominal models were built to explore the effects of the ambient populations of different social groups on the distribution of theft. The results found that the influences of ambient populations of different social groups on the spatial distribution of theft are different. Accounting for the difference in the “risk–benefit” characteristics among different activity groups to the offenders, individuals from the migrant population are the most likely to be potential victims, followed by suburban and middle-income groups, while college, affluent, and affordable housing populations are the least likely. The local elderly population had no significant impact. This research has further enriched the studies of time geography and deepened routine activity theory. It suggests that the focus of crime prevention and control strategies developed by police departments should shift from the residential space to the activity space. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Face recognition is a growing technology that has been broadly employed in forensics applications such as unlawful person identification, security, and authentication. Computer vision problems now find application in all spheres of the digital world ranging from a normal person’s routine mobile face ID login to institutional facial attendance system to national security-based software to identify criminals. The proposed work examines the performance of face reorganization model using CNN with SVM classifier. Two phases are involved in the creation of the facial recognition system. The first stage involves picking up or extracting facial features, while the second step involves pattern classification. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has made significant strides in FR technology in recent years but most of the existing models considered only one or two parameters but the proposed work computed all important performance parameters, i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Further, the time required to train the model and its prediction time are also computed in this study. The efficiency and dominance of the proposed method are compared with several face detection algorithms, i.e., Eigenface, Fisherface, and Lbph, and results clearly show the supremacy of the proposed approach over the traditional approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Using fingerphoto images acquired from mobile cameras, low-quality sensors, or crime scenes, it has become a challenge for automated identification systems to verify the identity due to various acquisition distortions. A significant type of photometric distortion that notably reduces the quality of a fingerphoto is the blurring of the image. This paper proposes a deep fingerphoto deblurring model to restore the ridge information degraded by the image blurring. As the core of our model, we utilize a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn the distribution of natural ridge patterns. We perform several modifications to enhance the quality of the reconstructed (deblurred) fingerphotos by our proposed model. First, we develop a multi-stage GAN to learn the ridge distribution in a coarse-to-fine framework. This framework enables the model to maintain the consistency of the ridge deblurring process at different resolutions. Second, we propose a guided attention module that helps the generator to focus mainly on blurred regions. Third, we incorporate a deep fingerphoto verifier as an auxiliary adaptive loss function to force the generator to preserve the ID information during the deblurring process. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on multiple public fingerphoto datasets as well as real-world blurred fingerphotos. In particular, our method achieves 5.2 dB, 8.7%, and 7.6% improvement in PSNR, AUC, and EER, respectively, compared to a state-of-the-art deblurring method.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Place-based short-term crime prediction models leverage the spatio-temporal patterns of historical crimes to predict aggregate volumes of crime incidents at specific locations over time. Under the umbrella of the crime opportunity theory, that suggests that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based short-term crime models. Researchers have used call detail records (CDR), data from location-based services such as Foursquare or from social media to characterize human mobility; and have shown that mobility metrics, together with historical crime data, can improve short-term crime prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose to use a publicly available fine-grained human mobility dataset from a location intelligence company to explore the effects of human mobility features on short-term crime prediction. For that purpose, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, different types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we show that adding human mobility flow features to historical crimes can improve the F1 scores for a variety of neural crime prediction models across cities and types of crimes, with improvements ranging from 2% to 7%. Our analysis also shows that some neural architectures can slightly improve the crime prediction performance when compared to non-neural regression models by at most 2%. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study analyzed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis from the angle of cyber-crime, highlighting the wide spectrum of cyberattacks that occurred around the world. The modus operandi of cyberattack campaigns was revealed by analyzing and considering cyberattacks in the context of major world events. Following what appeared to be substantial gaps between the initial breakout of the virus and the first COVID-19-related cyber-attack, the investigation indicates how attacks became significantly more frequent over time, to the point where three or four different cyber-attacks were reported on certain days. This study contributes in the direction of fifteen types of cyber-attacks which were identified as the most common pattern and its ensuing devastating events during the global COVID-19 crisis. The paper is unique because it covered the main types of cyber-attacks that most organizations are currently facing and how to address them. An intense look into the recent advances that cybercriminals leverage, the dynamism, calculated measures to tackle it, and never-explored perspectives are some of the integral parts which make this review different from other present reviewed papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a robust response to the objective used for the study. Using a multi-criteria decision-making problem-solving technique, many facets of cybersecurity that have been affected during the pandemic were then quantitatively ranked in ascending order of severity. The data was generated between March 2020 and December 2021, from a global survey through online contact and responses, especially from different organizations and business executives. The result show differences in cyber-attack techniques; as hacking attacks was the most frequent with a record of 330 out of 895 attacks, accounting for 37%. Next was Spam emails attack with 13%; emails with 13%; followed by malicious domains with 9%. Mobile apps followed with 8%, Phishing was 7%, Malware 7%, Browsing apps with 6%, DDoS has 6%, Website apps with 6%, and MSMM with 6%. BEC frequency was 4%, Ransomware with 2%, Botnet scored 2% and APT recorded 1%. The study recommends that it will continue to be necessary for governments and organizations to be resilient and innovative in cybersecurity decisions to overcome the current and future effects of the pandemic or similar crisis, which could be long-lasting. Hence, this study's findings will guide the creation, development, and implementation of more secure systems to safeguard people from cyber-attacks. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is important in the field of forensic identification and criminal investigation and requires fluorescent materials with near-infrared (NIR) emission to suppress the background fluorescence, with simultaneously high selectivity for fingerprints; however, this remains a challenge. Herein, we rationally designed and prepared a new NIR-emissive composite material composed of an NIR fluorophore, i.e., (E)-4-(7-(4-bromophenyl)imino) methyl)benzo[C][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (BrBTN), and porous starch through a simple grinding method. The BrBTN powder exhibited strong NIR emission with a high quantum yield of 0.209. Porous starch enabled high adsorption ability for fingerprints. Using the BrBTN@starch composite, clear images of the tertiary structure of a fingerprint with NIR emission on various substrates were obtained under 405 nm light excitation within 10 s using a mobile phone alone after a simple dust removal treatment. Benefiting from its strong NIR emission and high selectivity, the imaging resolution of the fingerprint fluorescent patterns based on the NIR composite was 3-times higher than that of commercial fingerprint powder. This work provides a novel strategy for the design of highly emissive NIR fingerprint powder with the advantages of reduced background fluorescence, easy operation, high photostability, low cost and low toxicity to developers, indicating its great potential in the field of trace inspection and biological imaging. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study examines the trends in and spatial distribution of recorded offending by Australian outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) affiliates at the onset of a territorial conflict between two clubs in the state of New South Wales. Results show an increase in recorded offending by OMCG affiliates involved in the conflict and based in the disputed territory. Comparable increases in recorded offending by these clubs were not detected in the areas surrounding this territory or in the rest of New South Wales, and there was little mobility into the conflict region by those outside of it. There was a smaller, short-lived increase in recorded crime by affiliates of other gangs in the conflict region but not elsewhere. In short, changes in offending patterns were largely limited to the clubs involved in the conflict and localised to the territory in dispute. This research can help guide focused law enforcement responses during periods of gang conflict. © 2023 Australian Institute of Criminology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leveraged by a large-scale diffusion of sensing networks and scanning devices in modern cities, huge volumes of geo-referenced urban data are collected every day. Such an amount of information is analyzed to discover data-driven models, which can be exploited to tackle the major issues that cities face, including air pollution, virus diffusion, human mobility, crime forecasting, traffic flows, etc. In particular, the detection of city hotspots is de facto a valuable organization technique for framing detailed knowledge of a metropolitan area, providing high-level summaries for spatial datasets, which are a valuable support for planners, scientists, and policymakers. However, while classic density-based clustering algorithms show to be suitable for discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. In fact, a proper threshold setting is very difficult when clusters in different regions have considerably different densities, or clusters with different density levels are nested. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are heavily characterized by variable densities, multi-density clustering seems to be more appropriate for discovering city hotspots. Indeed, such algorithms rely on multiple minimum threshold values and are able to detect multiple pattern distributions of different densities, aiming at distinguishing between several density regions, which may or may not be nested and are generally of a non-convex shape. This paper discusses the research issues and challenges for analyzing urban data, aimed at discovering multi-density hotspots in urban areas. In particular, the study compares the four approaches (DBSCAN, OPTICS-xi, HDBSCAN, and CHD) proposed in the literature for clustering urban data and analyzes their performance on both state-of-the-art and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that multi-density clustering algorithms generally achieve better results on urban data than classic density-based algorithms. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - With the rapid development of the economic and social situation and the improvement of public security defense and governance, the quantity of cases of child trafficking by means of theft, forcible robbery, and deception has decreased significantly, and the offense of selling offspring has shown an obvious increasing trend. Based on the case data of child trafficking crime on the website of Chinese Judicial Documents, this study examines the spatiotemporal pattern and criminal decision-making mechanism of offense of selling offspring. The results are as follows: (1) Sold children are characterized by "younger age, " most of them are zero-year-old infants, and males are far more represented than females. Most sellers are young and middle-aged men or young women, mainly unemployed, farmers and workers. They sell their offspring to buyers with strong demand through social networks of acquaintances, special occupational groups, traffickers, network media, or persuasion by buyers/intermediaries. The reasons for selling include economic difficulties, out of wedlock birth, extra births, intermediary solicitation, debt repayment. (2) Temporally, the annual change of crime can be divided into three stages: stable sequence and low incidence, rapid growth and sustained high incidence, and steady decline, which are mainly affected by China's population policy, action on combating trafficking, and the development of the website of Chinese Judicial Documents. The monthly change presents a synchronous trend on the birth and betrayal time of the children, with spring and summer being more represented than autumn and winter. (3) Spatially, the origin region of selling presents the pattern of "three sources" with "Sichuan-Shandong-Fujian" as the core, and the destination region of selling presents the pattern of "North-South two sinks" with "Shandong-Fujian" as the core on the macro level. Microscopically, it occurs in closed spaces with a frequent flow of people, and residential buildings and open spaces with a frequent flow of people. The overall trafficking path is "inter-provincial flowing out from the southwest source area and intra-provincial flow of the South-North sink area. " Inter-provincial migration is mostly driven by interests and is dominated by trafficking criminal groups, while intra-provincial migration is mostly formed by temporary one-time gang crimes to meet the needs of buying and selling. (4) Based on the theory of rational choice, this study constructs a decision-making framework for the offense of selling offspring, and finds that the crime is mainly affected by the comprehensive influence of background factors, previous experience, and situational induction, and the bounded rational choice made by potential criminals under the decision-making evaluation of "benefit-cost-risk. " After deciding to sell their children, potential criminals will choose the appropriate time, place, and way to maximize interests. © Starobulgarska Literatura 2022.

AB  - Gait recognition is a biometric identification method based on individual walking patterns. This modality is applied in a wide range of applications, such as criminal investigations and identification systems, since it can be performed at a long distance and requires no cooperation of interests. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition systems, and previous studies have utilized depth information captured by RGB-D cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect. In recent years, multi-layer LiDAR sensors, which can obtain range images of a target at a range of over 100 m in real time, have attracted significant attention in the field of autonomous mobile robots and self-driving vehicles. Compared with general cameras, LiDAR sensors have rarely been used for biometrics due to the low point cloud densities captured at long distances. In this study, we focus on improving the robustness of gait recognition using LiDAR sensors under confounding conditions, specifically addressing the challenges posed by viewing angles and measurement distances. First, our recognition model employs a two-scale spatial resolution to enhance immunity to varying point cloud densities. In addition, this method learns the gait features from two invariant viewpoints (i.e., left-side and back views) generated by estimating the walking direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention block that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise weights to fuse the features from the aforementioned resolutions and viewpoints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-view, cross-distance challenges, and practical scenarios.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Segregation is often viewed and studied as a macro-level phenomenon, described in terms of aggregate patterns across areas. Empirical analyses of segregation are typically conducted at the macro-level as well, explaining changes and variations in segregation through contextual-level factors such as population size, region, or percent White. However, there is an established body of literature that recognizes segregation as an outcome of micro-level processes of locational attainments and residential mobility that considers the role of household characteristics like income, education, and nativity. This work is fundamentally important for testing the dominant theoretical frameworks employed in segregation research, which largely emphasize that segregation is driven by micro-level characteristics and processes and center the barriers and opportunities in residential mobility. Additionally, the locational attainments approach can be linked with outcomes that are essentially consequences of segregation such as educational disparities, health disparities, and unequal exposure to crime. While both levels of analyses are important, a fundamental link between them has been missing which could explicate how locational attainments directly produce residential segregation patterns. In this final empirical chapter, we draw on Fossett’s (2017) difference-of-means approach to calculating segregation indices to establish a direct quantitative link between predicted outcomes from household-level locational attainment models and overall residential segregation outcomes at the community level. This approach opens up a new toolbox of methods that are popular in inequality studies, including regression standardization and decomposition, which allow us to analyze residential segregation as a stratification outcome. We perform this analysis on 25 metropolitan areas with a focus on White-Black, White-Latino, and White-Asian residential segregation in 2010. We find that White-Black segregation is largely attributable to differences in rates of return on resources relevant for locational attainments, while White-Latino and White-Asian segregation can be explained more by group differences in characteristics and resources such as income and nativity. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - This article examines the problem of the special emotional regime of hard labour prisons in the Russian Empire in the early twentieth century in the context of the social construction of emotions characteristic of a revolutionary community. The paper aims to identify the determinants of the success of the revolutionary movement in the events of 1917. The author focuses on the mechanisms of communication of political prisoners and the role of the emotional component in the formation of a stable system of social interaction in a revolutionary environment. Employing the methodology of the history of emotions and comparative analysis, the author studies both previously known historical sources (letters of F. E. Dzerzhinsky) and archival materials (perlustration of letters from prisoners of the Smolensk convict prison) which have not been studied before. The article demonstrates how the special conditions of imprisonment shaped the emotional regime of hard labour prisons and contributed to the formation of a revolutionary community. With classical communication mechanisms limited, prisoners developed alternative means of communication. Also, the author pays special attention to the peculiarities of the written language of political prisoners and its evolution in conditions of hard labour and interaction with the criminal environment. The main results of the study are related to the term “emotional code” as a characteristic communication mechanism (“friend or foe” system) within a revolutionary community. In the context of the social processes of the beginning of the century, the opposition to the growing social melancholy on the part of the revolutionary community stands out. It was not only able to build communication mechanisms that were reliable and closed to external analysis based on similar emotional patterns but also used emotional constructions for agitation and propaganda in the public environment. Specific images of the future and the positive emotions associated with it have become a constructive alternative to the negative phenomena that prevail in the public consciousness during the last years of the empire’s existence. The main “weapon” of the revolutionary community in 1917, along with propaganda, was empathy, highly developed emotional intelligence, and the ability to accurately capture the emotions of one’s surroundings. The article concludes that labour prisons were “laboratories of emotions” which played a significant role in the crystallisation of the revolutionary community and the formation of its mobilisation potential. © 2023 Ural Federal University.

AB  - The rapid development of network function virtualization (NFV) technology on a large scale and the explosive growth of network traffic in enterprises has made it necessary to move to the paradigm of middlebox services (MB) in the cloud. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of these middlebox services that needs to be deployed in the cloud. However, with the growth of network attacks, redirecting enterprise traffic to external middleboxes inevitably raises new concerns related to packet content security and unauthorized access to the ruleset used for detection. To address these concerns, many research efforts targeted the design and development of IDS that operate over encrypted traffic (secure IDS) by looking for ways to make matching possible over encrypted data (aka secure/encrypted pattern matching) without any leakage while maintaining the same level of efficiency. However, most of the existing designs are communication inefficient and too slow to be deployed to support 5G network traffic that requires high throughput. Furthermore, the majority of real network traffic is legitimate and needs to be filtered quickly. Therefore, in order to improve the inspection delay, we propose in this paper a fast and efficient secure IDS that performs detection over encrypted network traffic based on the Searchable Encryption (SE) class of methods using a two-layer architecture in which the first layer is used to quickly filter out the majority of legitimate traffic and the second layer is used to further inspect only unfiltered malicious traffic. We implemented our solution and a recent powerful secure IDS and showed how our approach provides better results and outperforms it. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Social science researchers face risks when studying deviant or criminal behavior, especially when researching violent extremism online. The author emphasizes the importance of acquiring necessary skills to operate safely and anonymously. In the (cyber-)social ecosystem characterized by the centrality of a new dimension of human experience that goes beyond the internet and social media, the Left-Wing Extremism and Violent Left-Wing and Anarchist Extremism (VLWAE) constitute an important challenge for security. The author provides guidelines for conducting online research on Left-Wing Extremism entities using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), while ensuring digital hygiene and safety, to study their online activities, propaganda, and radicalization strategies. OSINT enables researchers to collect information from various sources, including private and encrypted messaging channels, to understand the organization and mobilization of extremist campaigns. The use of various tools and techniques is presented to highlight the most relevant elements that should be included in a research report on left-wing extremism target. The author also focuses on the importance of technological innovation to support research in this field. Moreover, a strong integration between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and OSINT is revolutionizing online investigations of left-wing extremism and other forms of extremism and terrorism. AI-based technology allows researchers to analyze large amounts of images, videos, and data with the aim for identifying patterns and trends. In the near-future scenario, AI will be used in extremist individuals and entities profiling to anticipate new onlife security threats. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023, corrected publication 2024.

AB  - The recent, rapid development of mobile technology has impacted modern life in significant ways. The ubiquitous utility of Android mobile devices is a perfect example. Android mobile devices store many user data in the memory, and these data could be critical to forensics investigations. Among the data that can be acquired from Android mobile devices, user operations are one of the most important pieces of evidence. They can tell what a suspect or a victim was doing with their mobile devices. However, there is a lack of effective techniques that can help forensics investigators extract user operations from Android mobile devices and reconstruct user operation state models with timestamps. In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically identifies user operations from Android mobile devices' event logs and constructs a timestamped state model. First, we extract system logs relevant to the Android activity lifecycle. Then, we identify patterns in Android activity lifecycle in the logs and investigate the relationship between these lifecycle patterns and actual user operations. After that, we reconstruct user operations into timestamped state models. Using an experimental evaluation with ten real-world Android applications, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively reconstruct timestamped state models, by achieving a mean of 100% activity coverage, a mean of 94.3% user operation coverage, and a mean of 95.5% state model coverage. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Since the annexation of Crimea by Russia, Eastern Europe has experienced an unprecedented migration crisis. Most Ukrainians are internally displaced or have migrated to other countries, facing an uncertain and difficult future. Moreover, the outbreak of war in Ukraine has considerably affected various areas of the economic, social, and political life of European states, including on tourism. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the situation of the migrant crisis and the implications that this phenomenon has on the destination states. The implications of the current situation in Ukraine for mobility and migration are significant and have left a deep imprint on the socio-economic context of Europe. The first part of this paper highlights the contextual issues specific to the migration of Ukrainians, more precisely, the patterns of flows and the practices of their acceptance and reception. The second section outlines an overview of the stocks of immigrants that have been registered, and in the final section, it will be presented the main challenges facing European states from the perspective of destination states, but also of war refugees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - South African telecommunications market has reached a saturation point; as a result, telecommunication companies spend most of their budget on customer acquisition and retention, and very little is spent on fraud prevention or detection systems. This spending pattern has caused an increase in fraud, making it the most significant revenue leakage in telecommunications, where the leading fraud type is subscription fraud. Subscription fraud has a direct negative impact on the company’s revenue, bonuses of employees, and customers’ credit status. Although the current fraud systems can detect subscription fraud, they cannot identify the fraudster. This enables the fraudster to commit fraud using the same or multiple identity documents during the contract application process without being detected. In trying to change the spending pattern and prevent subscription fraud, we sought to determine the impact of subscription fraud in mobile telecommunication companies. We designed, developed, and implemented a Multimodal Biometrics System (MBS) using Python, SQLite3, and JavaScript to enable telecommunication companies to capture and store customer faces and fingerprints to use them for verification before approving the contract. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimension of the face and fingerprint images. PCA outperformed Independent Component Analysis and Linear Discriminate Analysis algorithms. To do image matching, we used the PCA-based representation for local features (PCA-SIFT) algorithm, which outperformed Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (OBR) algorithms. MBS results gave us biometric matching accuracy of 94.84%. MBS is easy to implement and cost-effective. The system can help identify the fraudster, prevent subscription fraud and reduce revenue leakage. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - The popularity of credit card fraud is rising as the number of cashless transactions increases. Online transactions are expanding as more people use credit cards and mobile wallets. The growth of internet commerce has also accelerated the spread of credit card fraud. Examining the cardholder's spending patterns can help identify credit card theft. Any odd behavior is grounds for the transaction to be deemed fraudulent. There are many difficulties in detection, such as frequent profile changes between fraudulent and normal transactions. Researchers use numerous techniques to detect credit card fraud, among them are hidden markov model, naives bayes classifier, decision tree, k-nearest neighbour classifier, logistic regression. The aim of this research paper is to examine divergent approaches of credit card fraud detection.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases—100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Anomaly detection in videos captured by surveillance cameras is a critical area of research that aims to automatically identify unusual or abnormal events captured in video footage. The process of manually analyzing video data can be difficult, time-consuming, and prone to human mistake. In surveillance camera footage, anomaly detection uses machine learning and deep learning to automatically identify typical patterns of behavior and detect deviations from these patterns. This paper provides an examination of anomaly detection through videos captured by surveillance cameras and videos included from YouTube and various sites and examines the different algorithms and techniques used for analyzing video footage. In our proposed model we have used an ensemble learning model which includes MobileNet and LSTM combination ensembled with one another. The model is properly able to detect and distinguish between four different types of scenes. We proposed an approach by executing experiments on several real-world datasets and show that our approach methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. This research paper will provide a comprehensive understanding of anomaly detection in videos for crime scene activities happening in real life, including the latest advanced state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques, their limitations and challenges, and potential future directions of research.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Here we describe a Drosophila genome engineering technique that can scarlessly modify genomic sequences near any mapped attP attachment site previously integrated by transposon mobilization or gene targeting. This technique combines two highly efficient and robust procedures: phiC31 integrase–mediated site-specific integration and homing endonuclease–mediated resolution of local duplications. In this technique, a donor fragment containing the desired mutation(s) is first integrated into a selected attP site near the target locus by phiC31 integrase–mediated site-specific integration, which creates local duplications consisting of the mutant-containing donor fragment and the wild-type target locus. Next, homing endonuclease–induced double-stranded DNA breaks trigger recombination between the duplications and resolve the target locus to generate scarless mutant alleles. In every step, the desired flies can be easily identified by patterns of dominant markers, so no large-scale screens are needed. This technique is highly efficient and can be used to generate scarless point mutations, insertions, and deletions. The availability of large libraries of mapped attP site–containing transposon/CRISPR insertions in Drosophila allows the modification of more than half of the euchromatic Drosophila genome at a high efficiency. As more and more attP-containing insertions are generated and mapped, this technique will be able to modify larger portions of the Drosophila genome. The principles of this technique are applicable to other organisms where modifications to the genome are feasible. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The illegal removal of a minor from the custody of the child’s natural parents or legally appointed guardians is known as child abduction or child stealing. Child kidnapping is a serious offence, and it is increasing with rapid rate. Safety of a child is always a matter of concern of parents as well as school authorities. In this paper, statistical analysis of dataset of child kidnapping with different parameters such as age, gender, race, height and weight are discussed. Supervised machine learning algorithms is used to identify the pattern of abduction done by family member or outside the family. The classifier received the accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, Internet of Things based system is also proposed that will monitor the location of the child whenever child enters or exits in the school vehicle. The proposed system is designed with Arduino microcontroller, RFID reader, GSM module, GPS module, PIR sensor, and Piezo Buzzer. The system gets triggered when child enters or exits in the school vehicle and RFID tags are read that are fixed on the shoe of child. The proposed system is tested with 10 students at different time with different geographical locations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In recent decades, historians working on crime and gender have been focusing on the interplay between female crime and the urban setting. Subsequently, migration has become increasingly important within the research field. While this development has led to new findings regarding women's participation in crime in early modern metropolises, in contrast, little is known about prosecuting patterns in smaller urban centers in predominantly rural regions. This situation is particularly true for less urbanized territories, such as the geographical area of the Swiss Confederation. It is often assumed that women in big cities led more mobile and independent lives than their counterparts in smaller towns. This socio-economic difference in female profiles is used as the main explanation for the disparities in gendered patterns in the registration of criminality. By analyzing the records of the criminal court of seventeenth-century Protestant Bern, this article aims to contribute to the understanding of women's crime in early modern urban territories. The findings demonstrate that smaller towns could also show high levels of female defendants. However, the city of Bern was not a place of relative freedom for women. Rather, the opposite is true: the authorities' control, focusing on an ordered society and household, led to strong formal control of mobility and (im)morality, which had a lasting impact on the prosecution of women. This policy, the article argues, is the main explanation for the high percentage of recorded female delinquency. © 2023 Netherlands Institute of International Relations. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital technologies have recently become more advanced, allowing for the development of social networking sites and applications. Despite these advancements, phone calls and text messages still make up the largest proportion of mobile data usage. It is possible to study human communication behaviors and mobility patterns using the useful information that mobile phone data provide. Specifically, the digital traces left by the large number of mobile devices provide important information that facilitates a deeper understanding of human behavior and mobility configurations for researchers in various fields, such as criminology, urban sensing, transportation planning, and healthcare. Mobile phone data record significant spatiotemporal (i.e., geospatial and time-related data) and communication (i.e., call) information. These can be used to achieve different research objectives and form the basis of various practical applications, including human mobility models based on spatiotemporal interactions, real-time identification of criminal activities, inference of friendship interactions, and density distribution estimation. The present research primarily reviews studies that have employed mobile phone data to investigate, assess, and predict human communication and mobility patterns in the context of crime prevention. These investigations have sought, for example, to detect suspicious activities, identify criminal networks, and predict crime, as well as understand human communication and mobility patterns in urban sensing applications. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted on crime research studies that were published between 2014 and 2022 and listed in eight electronic databases. In this review, we evaluated the most advanced methods and techniques used in recent criminology applications based on mobile phone data and the benefits of using this information to predict crime and detect suspected criminals. The results of this literature review contribute to improving the existing understanding of where and how populations live and socialize and how to classify individuals based on their mobility patterns. The results show extraordinary growth in studies that utilized mobile phone data to study human mobility and movement patterns compared to studies that used the data to infer communication behaviors. This observation can be attributed to privacy concerns related to acquiring call detail records (CDRs). Additionally, most of the studies used census and survey data for data validation. The results show that social network analysis tools and techniques have been widely employed to detect criminal networks and urban communities. In addition, correlation analysis has been used to investigate spatial–temporal patterns of crime, and ambient population measures have a significant impact on crime rates. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents with deep neural network model MOBIADAPT which has been specifically developed for tire pattern classification on mobile devices to provide with critical clues in crime investigations. Understanding that only low-end mobile devices are normally present during real-life situations, the proposed solution is designed to be both lightweight and effective. Such a solution is achieved starting with the choice of backbone which is both highly efficient and provides optimal accuracy. To achieve this goal, the state-of-the-art image classification model MobileNet [1] was chosen due to its excellent generalization capability and high accuracy while remaining lightweight. The model was further optimized for tire pattern classification by applying the concept of Adaptation. This technique simplifies the model architecture while maintaining high accuracy, thus making it more suitable for deployment on mobile devices.After adaptation the complexity of the initial backbone was reduced >10x to only have about ~53K parameters while maintaining the accuracy to stand over 99% in classifying the test dataset containing tire patterns images.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between different groups of explanatory variables (i.e., dynamic human activity variables, static variables of social disorganisation and crime generators, and combinations of both sets of variables) and property crime patterns across neighbourhood areas of London during the pandemic (from 2020 to 2021). Using the dynamic human activity variables sensed from mobile phone GPS big data sets, three types of ‘Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator’ (LASSO) regression models (i.e., static, dynamic, and static and dynamic) differentiated into explanatory variable groups were developed for seven types of property crime. Then, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to reveal the spatial associations between distinct explanatory variables and the specific type of crime. The findings demonstrated that human activity dynamics impose a substantially stronger influence on specific types of property crimes than other static variables. In terms of crime type, theft obtained particularly high relationships with dynamic human activity compared to other property crimes. Further analysis revealed important nuances in the spatial associations between property crimes and human activity across different contexts during the pandemic. The result provides support for crime risk prediction that considers the impact of dynamic human activity variables and their varying influences in distinct situations. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Due to their high density-specific stiffnesses and strength, fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) composites are particularly interesting for mobility and transport applications. Warp-knitted non-crimp fabrics (NCF) are one possible way to produce such FRP composites. They are advantageous because of their low production costs and the ability to tailor the properties of the textile to the reinforcement and drape requirements of the application. Based on their specific production parameters, their draping properties can vary significantly. Draping simulations are used to predict the forming behaviour without relying on costly and time consuming trial and error experiments. However, these simulations require a broad material dataset to make accurate predictions. Previous studies have investigated the relationships between production parameters and drape behaviour only in isolation for a limited number of material parameters at a time. In this study, a comprehensive material characterisation is carried out. The influence of ply orientation, stitch pattern, stitch length and stitch tension on the tensile and bending properties and the friction, shear and drape behaviour of NCFs are investigated on a meso and macro scale. Furthermore, the inter-ply sliding phenomena in bias extension tests are analysed and the results of bias extension and picture frame tests are compared. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - With the advancement in technology, the importance of person recognition in photographs or videos has grown due to its usefulness in the search for wanted persons and criminal identification using various theories and algorithms and various non-hybrid and hybrid techniques to identify the person through the face, and its features have been developed. The paper proposed a hybrid algorithm to improve the performance of person identification in video files. The system works through several steps: first, face detection using Viola–Jones algorithm; second, feature extraction by algorithm local binary pattern (LBP); final, person identification by hybrid proposed algorithm (HPBFF) by hybrid between backpropagation neural network and firefly algorithm. The results show that the system was able to identify and monitor the person with a high classification accuracy rate of 98.4%, compared to 94.7% for the approach without the hybrid. The results of the tests revealed that the system is robust and has a high recognition rate, making it suitable for use in mobile and compact identification and authentication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The classical “BGW protocol” (Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson, STOC 1988) shows that secure multiparty computation (MPC) among n parties can be realized with perfect full security if t&lt; n/ 3 parties are corrupted. This holds against malicious adversaries in the “standard” model for MPC, where a fixed set of n parties is involved in the full execution of the protocol. However, the picture is less clear in the mobile adversary setting of Ostrovsky and Yung (PODC 1991), where the adversary may periodically “move” by uncorrupting parties and corrupting a new set of t parties. In this setting, it is unclear if full security can be achieved against an adversary that is maximally mobile, i.e., moves after every round. The question is further motivated by the “You Only Speak Once” (YOSO) setting of Gentry et al. (Crypto 2021), where not only the adversary is mobile but also each round is executed by a disjoint set of parties. Previous positive results in this model do not achieve perfect security, and either assume probabilistic corruption and a nonstandard communication model, or only realize the weaker goal of security-with-abort. The question of matching the BGW result in these settings remained open. In this work, we tackle the above two challenges simultaneously. We consider a layered MPC model, a simplified variant of the fluid MPC model of Choudhuri et al. (Crypto 2021). Layered MPC is an instance of standard MPC where the interaction pattern is defined by a layered graph of width n, allowing each party to send secret messages and broadcast messages only to parties in the next layer. We require perfect security against a malicious adversary who may corrupt at most t parties in each layer. Our main result is a perfect, fully secure layered MPC protocol with an optimal corruption threshold of t&lt; n/ 3, thus extending the BGW feasibility result to the layered setting. This implies perfectly secure MPC protocols against a maximally mobile adversary. © 2023, International Association for Cryptologic Research.

AB  - Due to the rapid growth in the use of smartphones, the digital traces (e.g., mobile phone data, call detail records) left by the use of these devices have been widely employed to assess and predict human communication behaviors and mobility patterns in various disciplines and domains, such as urban sensing, epidemiology, public transportation, data protection, and criminology. These digital traces provide significant spatiotemporal (geospatial and time-related) data, revealing people’s mobility patterns as well as communication (incoming and outgoing calls) data, revealing people’s social networks and interactions. Thus, service providers collect smartphone data by recording the details of every user activity or interaction (e.g., making a phone call, sending a text message, or accessing the internet) done using a smartphone and storing these details on their databases. This paper surveys different methods and approaches for assessing and predicting human communication behaviors and mobility patterns from mobile phone data and differentiates them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. It also gives information about spatial, temporal, and call characteristics that have been extracted from mobile phone data and used to model how people communicate and move. We survey mobile phone data research published between 2013 and 2021 from eight main databases, namely, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, SAGE, Science Direct, Scopus, SpringerLink, and Web of Science. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 148 studies were selected. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - People nowadays can do various tasks more easily, thanks to the rapid development of technology. All current industries are undoubtedly impacted by this, including the banking sector. Many people are switching from making transactions via ATMs to mobile banking. In addition to convenience, security is one of the essential components that must be maintained and improved by every bank because patterns and methods of crime can change due to technological developments. This study aims to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to detect fraudulent transactions through mobile banking. The data used to create the AI model is mobile banking transactions at XYZ Bank in 2021. Based on the research results, the XGBoost model has the best performance com- pared to other models and can be used as an early warning system to detect fraudulent transactions in mobile banking. © 2023, ICIC International.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - It requires innovations to accurately predict crimes and offending risks due to the complex nature of human behaviors within different social contexts. In recent years, theory-based and data-driven agent-based models have become useful tools in computational criminology with the abundance of public data, the rise of computing powers, and extensive explorations of related theories and modeling tools. In this paper, we present CARESim, an integrated simulation environment to predict the risks of high-risk individuals committing street violent crimes. The simulation environment combines agent-based modeling with a real geographical information system and incorporates public data (e.g., environmental data, crime data, census data, and transportation data) to reproduce authentic human mobility. This simulation environment is capable of replicating crime patterns and evaluating policies. We demonstrate the use of this environment and illustrate how key factors, such as social networks, the neighborhood, the weather, police patrol strategies, the population, and citizens’ behaviors, impact the risk of street-level violent offending. Furthermore, the environment can support the optimization of patrol strategies and offer evaluations of different social setups that could be unfeasible or expensive to test in real life. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since the eruption of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, both Ukrainian and Russian diasporas in Sweden have been reframing themselves through memories, narratives and symbols. They have been revised in connection to the initial Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea (2014), the “homeland” as well as previous diasporic mobilizations in the country of residence. Revising the memories, narratives and symbols to fit the new reality of a full-scale war also has meant renegotiating group boundaries in the solidarity with Ukraine movement. In this study, I focus on the collective memory and group boundary-making within the pro-Ukraine movement and demonstrations in Stockholm, Sweden, and investigate the change in solidarity patterns, specifically performed during the initial mobilization due to the annexation of Crimea, Russian-backed insurgency in the eastern Ukraine, and the first months of Russian invasion of Ukraine. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This research includes an analysis of total crime with a detailed insight into common or con¬ventional crime in the five-year period before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (2015- 2019) compared to the year of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Empirical analysis is based on secondary data of registered crimes and misdemeanors for this purpose requested and ob¬tained from the Croatian Ministry of Interior, which is an indirect measurement of crime in a particular area (Palmer, 2020). The problem of exploratory research in this paper is the acquisition of new cognition about possible changes in the scope, structure and dynamics of crime and the typology and patterns of police registered crimes and offences in the pandemic crisis period, compared to the previous five years in Croatia. The obtained results are observed through the applicability of theoretical concepts of environmental criminology in explaining the change of trends in typology and patterns of criminal and deviant behavior. The purpose of the research was to show how the emerging pandemic influences everyday life and affects the mobility of overall crime in general, but also the specific segments of crime in the Republic of Croatia and individual police directorates. © 2021 Institut za društvena istraživanja u Zagrebu–Institute for Social Research in Zagreb Sva prava pridržana–All rights reserved.

AB  - 3D-reconstructed relocation of spectral feature is a key technology in multi-spectral imaging fusion and 3D reconstruction. Here, the feasibility was to explore about relocating spectral data onto 3D-reconstructed dense point cloud through a new neural network HF-Net, one deep-learning-based AI technology and also a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that is able to simultaneously predict local features and global descriptors for spectral localization. Such an HF-Net was adopted to carry out the spectral relocation of heterogeneous localization. Specifically, the MobileNet and NetVLAD layers were taken to extract the global descriptors among the dataset of three-dimensional color point cloud from the spectral image so as to find the approximate position of spectral image in the three-dimensional point cloud. With the conjectural locations obtained through the prior global retrieval within those candidate places, the SuperPoint was utilized to get the local descriptors and key point scores of the spectral image so that the matching spectral points were found in the three-dimensional point cloud, therewith having mapped out the spectral information and three-dimensional reconstruction pattern. By leveraging the learned descriptors, this assay achieved remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance, demonstrating more robust and efficient than SSD algorithm. Due to limits with GPU (graphics processing unit) memory, the extracted spectral features were down-sampled from image to the largest resolution of 6016 × 4512 pixels. With HF-Net being trained through multi-task distillation in TensorFlow 1.12, a spectral image had been able to relocate into 3D reconstruction pattern in 12s under having run on the device of NVidia TESLA V100 with 32G memory and CPU of Intel (R) Xeon (R) Silver 4114 with 12G memory. The approach proposed here can realize the fine positioning of 3D spatial information and spectral features of 3D physical evidence. At present, there seems no such an exploration in forensic science home and abroad, revealing that the exploration tried here is a new application of artificial intelligence to the full-dimensional imaging data fusion technology of physical evidence. Such an HF-Net-based relocation is accurate, scalable, efficient, and a monolithic deep neural network choice for descriptor extraction, capable of achieving higher exactness on large-scale multi-spectral imaging fusion and 3D reconstruction. © 2022, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

With a total 13 participants with two small focus group sessions as well as in-depth interviews, our findings unveiled three factors, trust, contract, and value, deeply rooted in researchers’ attitudes and their data sharing and reuse patterns and behaviors. Through comprehending their concern behind sharing and reusing research data, we seek crucial insights that could be beneficial in developing a criminological research data repository, further consolidating the research data infrastructure in social science. Sharing and reusing data can advance scientific research and provide innovative possibilities for practice in criminology (e.g., new correctional methods, new crime prevention policies), providing sustained and thriving energy for the field. © 2023, National Taiwan University, Department of Library and Information Science.

AB  - The fraud problem has drastically increased with the rapid growth of online lending. Since loan applications, approvals and disbursements are operated online, deceptive borrowers are prone to conceal or falsify information to maliciously obtain loans, while lenders have difficulty in identifying fraud without direct contacts and lack binding force on customers' loan performance, which results in the frequent occurrence of fraud events. Therefore, it is significant for financial institutions to apply valuable data and competitive technologies for fraud detection to reduce financial losses from loan scams. This paper combines the advantages of statistical methods and ensemble learning algorithms to design the grouped trees and weighted ensemble algorithm (GTWE), and establishes fraud prediction models for online loans based on mobile application usage behaviors(App behaviors) by logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM) and the GTWE algorithm, respectively. The experimental results show that the fraud prediction model based on the GTWE algorithm achieves outstanding classification effect and stability with satisfactory interpretability. Meanwhile, the fraud probability of customers detected by the fraud prediction model is as high as 84.19%, which indicates that App behaviors have a considerable impact on predicting fraud in online loan application.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

AB  - This study aims to identify the main types, their magnitudes of influence, and their characteristics of regional heterogeneity of theft places, and take the lead in discussing the application of geographical detector in the field of crime geography analysis. Using criminal judgement, Points of Interest, Location-based Service data, road network, census data, housing data, and other data in the central urban area of Beijing and taking the 1 km×1 km square grid as our spatial analysis unit, this research demonstrates that thirty-seven types of urban facilities belong to the major crime generators, crime attractors or crime enablers at the global level, and the edge areas of roads, administrative districts and land uses are also proved to be evident theft locations. Among them, the more influential theft locations are more aligned with the crime generating conditions proposed by crime pattern theory, including accessible crime target and lower risk of arrest. Second, as stated by social disorganization theory, if the level of social disorganization composed by mobility factor and housing factor decreases, the number of theft location types as well as their impacts will gradually diminish. But except for the low social disorganization districts, the rankings of relative influence of various facilities and edge areas on theft crime remain relatively stable. Third, geographic detector has the advantages of no linear hypothesis, no collinearity problem, clear physical meaning and so on. But owing to the neglect of the potential interference by confounding factors, geographical detector would probably overestimate the impacts of independent variables. It can be testified by the moderate correlation between the rankings of the overall influence of theft locations obtained from the negative binomial regression and those calculated by the geographical detector. We suggest that combining elimination control method with geographical detector is a feasible path to achieve robust results, so classification discussion after grouping units with similar confounding factors is essential to overcome the potential endogeneity problem if we use geographical detector in crime geography as well as other sub-fields of human geography. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - The overall aim of the paper is to present evidence on the factors underpinning historical deportation cases, by exploring the reasons, explanations and patterns related to deportation in Australia. The purpose is to consider whether these historical factors are antecedent to current forms of deportation occurring in Australia, and to bring to the fore potential recurring patterns. Deportation is currently conceptualised by border criminologists as a punitive tool of discipline and control, within the realm of penal powers. Some of this work on the 'deportation regime' asserts that certain migrants, or groups of migrants, are undesirable: their identity, (not)belonging and punishment have become inherently intertwined, and their mobility has become politicised and criminalised. This article theorises that deportation has been used in Australia, now and in the past, to expel individuals who are viewed as detrimental to the 'health' of the host society. The 'deportation categories' demonstrate that migrants' desirability has historically been a temporary condition, shifting over time in line with the state's requirements. They also demonstrate the historical regime of criminalisation of undesirable others enacted through Australia's border control regime.  © The Author/s 2023.

AB  - Massive urbanization is considered to be one of the causes of population density that eventually triggers the creation of slums in a city. Slums are synonymous with poverty, crime, low education, and lack of infrastructure, making the area segregated from the formal urban space. Settlement communities have difficulty accessing facilities in the formal urban space. This study aims to formulate the elements that form the integration of slum areas. The method used is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The four stages in this SLR method are (1) identification; (2) screening; (3) eligibility; and (4) inclusion. A total of 62 articles were reviewed in this study. The results of this study are nineteen elements that form the integration of slum areas seen from physical and socio-economic aspects. If physical aspects include road network, accessibility, distance, public transportation, visual, public open space, periphery, settlement pattern, infrastructure, topography, and orientation, the socio-economic ones refer to local wisdom, background, social networks, types of activities, community empowerment, the sense of belonging, economic networks, and local economic empowerment. It is presumed that the results of this study can be used as guidelines for structuring slums so that they do not become marginalized areas or separate from formal urban areas. © 2023, Centre for Research on Settlements and Urbanism, Faculty of Geography, Babes-Bolyai University.

AB  - Crime has major influences in urban life, from migration and mobility patterns, to housing prices and neighborhood liveability. However, urban crime studies still largely rely on static data reported by the various institutions and organizations dedicated to urban safety. In this paper, we demonstrate how the use of digital technologies enables the fine-grained analysis of specific crimes over time and space. This paper leverages the rise of ubiquitous sensing to investigate the issue of bike theft in Amsterdam—a city with a dominant cycling culture, where reportedly more than 80,000 bikes are stolen every year. We use active location tracking to unveil where stolen bikes travel to and what their temporal patterns are. This is the first study using tracking technologies to focus on two critical aspects of contemporary cities: active mobility and urban crime. © 2023 Venverloo et al.

AB  - This project will be focused on effective recognizing and controlling system for Bank locker room which is fully self- determining. In cases of robberies, it commonly happens that the banned entrance in locker room area which can be detected by our security system. If the robbery take place the banks are not capable to recognize the robber due to absence of the proof by using the current human security operated system. The system will be designed in effective way by recognizing and controlling the illegal person to access the locker for the safety of bank lockerroom. In this, we proposed a three-phase conformation of procedure for smart locker using some registered pattern knocks,camera and SMS which check out the user. As we compare to any other previous approaches our system uses the web App which send an OTP to user’s mobile which has to be opened using android app which highlights the smart security. The designed system is highly proficient and consistent because of three security stages and not capable to break the combination of this, three stages. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.

AB  - Women environmental defenders face retaliation for mobilizing against extractive and polluting projects, which perpetrate violence against Indigenous, minority, poor and rural communities. The issue matters because it highlights the gendered nature of extractive violence and the urgent need to address the systemic patterns of violence that affect women defenders, who are often overlooked and underreported. Here we analyse violence against women defenders in environmental conflicts around the world. We use data from the Environmental Justice Atlas and employ log-linear and binomial regressions to find statistically significant patterns in displacement, repression, criminalization, violent targeting and assassinations committed against women defenders in extractive conflicts. Statistical results indicate that violence against women defenders is concentrated among mining, agribusiness and industrial conflicts in the geographical South. Repression, criminalization and violent targeting are closely linked, while displacement and assassination appear as extreme outcomes when conflict violence worsens. Women defenders experience high rates of violence regardless of countries’ governance accountability and gender equality. This work contributes to the broader sustainability agenda by highlighting the need to address the impacts of extractive activities on women. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The rapid growth of the telecommunication landscape leads to a rapid rise of frauds in such networks. In this article, Wangiri fraud in which users are deceived by being charged for services without their knowledge during a call is tackled. In fact, Wangiri fraud has significant negative financial and reputation consequences for the mobile service providers and also has a bad psychological impact on the victims. In order to identify this fraudulent behavior, three Wangiri fraud patterns are defined by analyzing call records of over a year. Then, the security and performance of unsupervised and supervised machine learning (ML) methods in detecting one Wangiri pattern are evaluated using a large real-world Call Detail Records (CDRs) data set. In the context of Wangiri fraud detection, classification algorithms outperformed the others based on the chosen security and performance metrics. Finally, the performance evaluation of these algorithms is extended in detecting the other two real-world Wangiri fraud patterns. This article provides a detailed definition of the Wangiri fraud patterns and outlines the implementation and evaluation of ML algorithms in the context of detecting Wangiri fraud. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that depending on fraud patterns the best ML algorithm to detect Wangiri fraud may also vary.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The proliferation of online language violence and online bullying deeply affects college students in a critical period of forming worldviews and values. The invention and application of mobile internet technology have broadened the communication channels of virtual society, and more and more netizens are expressing their views on social issues through the internet. There is an urgent need to analyze the mechanism of online language violence, explore governance strategies for online language violence, strengthen ideological and political education in universities, and adapt to the romantic situation of college students in the era of the internet. This study starts with the characteristics of online bullying in universities. It analyzes the derivation and dissemination mechanisms of campus online bullying through statistical analysis of the development patterns of campus online violence in typical network events. Research has found that online violence is mainly spread through platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, mainly through group or private chat attacks. At the same time, online violence can increase the crime rate among teenagers through theft and robbery. Campus online violence will have a profound impact on the growth of teenagers from both practical and psychological perspectives. Intervention in ideological and political education on campus and blocking online platforms within a week of online violence are essential means of organizing campus online violence. Meanwhile, continuous ideological and political education can significantly reduce the crime rate among minors caused by online violence. © (2023), (Elite Scientific Publications).

AB  - Malware attacks on the Android platform are rapidly increasing due to the high consumer adoption of Android smartphones. Advanced technologies have motivated cyber-criminals to actively create and disseminate a wide range of malware on Android smartphones. The researchers have conducted numerous studies on the detection of Android malware, but the majority of the works are based on the detection of generic Android malware. The detection based on malware categories will provide more insights about the malicious patterns of the malware. Therefore, this paper presents a detection solution for different Android malware categories, including adware, banking, SMS malware, and riskware. In this paper, a novel Huffman encoding-based feature vector generation technique is proposed. The experiments have proved that this novel approach significantly improves the efficiency of the detection model. This method makes use of system call frequencies as features to extract malware’s dynamic behavior patterns. The proposed model was evaluated using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the proposed model with the Random Forest classifier outperforms some existing methodologies with a detection accuracy of 98.70%. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The world has seen exponential growth in deploying Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In recent years, connected IoT devices have surpassed the number of connected non-IoT devices. The number of IoT devices continues to grow and they are becoming a critical component of the national infrastructure. IoT devices' characteristics and inherent limitations make them attractive targets for hackers and cyber criminals. Botnet attack is one of the serious threats on the Internet today. This article proposes pattern-based feature selection methods as part of a machine learning (ML)-based botnet detection system. Specifically, two methods are proposed: the first is based on the most dominant pattern feature values and the second is based on maximal frequent itemset mining. The proposed feature selection method uses Gini impurity and an unsupervised clustering method to select the most influential features automatically. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods have improved the performance of the detection system. The developed system has a true positive rate of 100% and a false positive rate of 0% for best performing models. In addition, the proposed methods reduce the computational cost of the system as evidenced by the detection speed of the system.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Many rural areas experience population stagnation or decline from out-migration with corresponding economic downturns. This is the case for the Northern Territory in Australia, a vast and sparsely populated jurisdiction. Its government has long sought to encourage stronger population growth but its population is young and highly transient, leading to high staff turn-overs and challenges for industries and government to attract families and skilled workers. Place-based factors such as job opportunities, access to essential services or environmental amenities influence satisfaction and migration decisions. The aim of this study was to understand why people might stay or move away through analysing responses to two open-text questions on the best and worst aspect of living in the Northern Territory. Over 3500 valid responses were analysed using machine learning-based unsupervised topic modelling which uncovered latent clusters. Forty-four percent of positive aspects were clustered into lifestyle factors, while negative aspects clustered around high living costs and crime. Some aspects, such as the weather and distance to other places were discussed as both positive and negative aspects. Topics discussed by respondents could be directly related to their intention to leave the Northern Territory, and also to specific individual's demographic characteristics providing insights for policies focused on attracting and retaining population. The use of unsupervised text mining in population research is rare and this study verifies its use to deliver objective and nuanced results generated from a large qualitative data set. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - As the living tissue connecting urban places, streets play significant roles in driving city development, providing essential access, and promoting human interactions. Understanding street activities and how these activities vary across different streets is critical for designing both efficient and livable streets. However, current street classification frameworks primarily focus on either streets’ functions in transportation networks or their adjacent land uses rather than actual activity patterns, resulting in coarse classifications. This research proposes an activity-based street classification framework to categorize street segments based on their temporal street activity patterns, which is derived from high-resolution de-identified and privacy-enhanced mobility data. We then apply the proposed framework to 18,023 street segments in the City of Boston and reveal 10 distinct activity-based street types (ASTs). These ASTs highlight dynamic street activities on streets, which complements existing street classification frameworks, which focus on the static or transportation characteristics of the street segments. Our results show that a street classification framework based on temporal street activity patterns can identify street categories at a finer granularity than current methods, which can offer useful implications for state-of-the-art urban management and planning. In particular, we find that our classification distinguishes better those streets where crime is more prevalent than current functional or contextual classifications of streets. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent studies focus on how to accurately measure ambient population and its effects on crimes. However, limited attention has been paid to the internal heterogeneity of ambient population composition and its temporal variation. To fill these gaps, controlling for indicators of ambient population, social disorganization, crime generators and attractors, we model the effects of the share of low income, middle income, upper-middle income and high income of ambient population at the community level in the whole and specific time periods on weekdays and weekends. Results suggest that while all income groups of the ambient population contribute to theft at the community level, their contributions are not uniform. At different periods of both weekdays and weekends, there is no single income group that consistently predicts theft. Furthermore, the magnitude of the impact of each income group fluctuates with time. Our results highlight the heterogeneous segments of the ambient population, coupled with the dynamic human mobility patterns, structure the convergence of the crime triangle – motivated offenders, potential targets, and guardianship – in nuanced yet crucial ways. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper attempts to present kidnappers’ spatial mobility pattern that becomes widely recognized especially for urban areas. Kidnappers’ mobility and identification of their channels are challenging tasks to the crime combating agencies world-wide. In order to develop the spatial model for intensity and extent of kidnappers’ mobility and kidnapping activities, the Tobler’s law of spatial interaction is used in this research to compute kidnappers’ mobility gradient between pairs of locations. Mobility matrix containing spatial gradient of kidnapper’s flow confirms to their core locations that have push force to spray them outward for safe shelters. It is evident from this study that (a) porous inter-state border, especially in areas which are congested and with inter-state nodes of road and railways, enhance the intensity and extent of kidnapping crime, (b) kidnappers North- South corridor along with National Highways passing through peripheral areas of Delhi state are important kidnappers channels, and (c) victims accessibility to nearest police station, and female dominated phenomena of densely populated areas are major factors that attract kidnappers. This model can be useful for crime combating agencies and local police administration to trace the cores and corridors of kidnappers’ movement in urban areas. © 2023 Institute of Indian Geographers.

AB  - Objectives: The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods: Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results: Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions: Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Tensile strain is a widely discussed method to improve electron mobility and luminescence of Ge and has been applied in infrared photodetectors. By combining thin film crimping technology with microelectronic processing technology, uniaxial or biaxial tensile strain is achieved in a suspended Ge micro-bridge structure. The strain state can be manipulated by adjusting the sizes of the patterns, and a uniaxial tensile strain of 3.46% and biaxial tensile strain of 0.31% have been demonstrated in this work. The three-dimensional finite element analysis proves that the tensile strain originates from the strain redistribution between the W film and the Ge micro-bridge structure, and finally, the simulation results agree with the experimental data very well.  © 2023 Author(s).

AB  - Place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep learning leverage the spatio-temporal patterns of historical crimes, together with built-environment factors, to predict aggregate volumes of crime incidents at specific locations. Nevertheless, related work has shown that crime incident data can suffer from under-reporting bias whereby certain social groups report more crimes than others and whereby certain crimes are recorded more often by the police. In addition, under the umbrella of crime opportunity theories that suggest that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based crime models implemented with deep learning. However, prior work has shown that human mobility data collected from cell phones can suffer from sampling bias because certain population groups are not equally represented due to lack of cell phone ownership. Despite these well reported data bias concerns, no related work has yet looked into the fairness of place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep learning; nor into the effect that adding human mobility data from cell phones as a predictor might have on their fairness. In this paper, we use publicly available fine-grained crime incident and human mobility data from the US to conduct a comprehensive fairness audit across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, different types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we explore potential root causes of the models' fairness metrics by looking into crime data bias, mobility data bias and algorithmic bias. Our results show that unfair predictions are pervasive across place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep-learning due to the inherent data bias in the crime incident data; that adding mobility features extracted from cell phone data decreases fairness under certain circumstances; and that part of the fairness loss can be explained by bias in the crime data, and in the predictive algorithms that might be exacerbating the data bias, with the mobility data bias having an insignificant effect on fairness loss. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Android has been a popular target for criminal actions due to its widespread use as a prominent mobile operating system, requiring the creation of sufficient security measures. Android has grown exposed to illegal activities due to its open-source design and ability to install third-party apps without centralized oversight. The suggested study thoroughly examines the rights that programs ask for to see whether there are any noticeable differences between the permissions used by malware samples and their benign equivalents. Based on complex authorization patterns, various machine learning methods are applied to distinguish between the two groups effectively. The discoveries spur the creation of solid security frameworks, eventually reducing the dangers of potential malware attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The combination of virtualization techniques with capillary computing and storage resources allows the instantiation of Virtual Network Functions throughout the network infrastructure, which brings more agility in the development and operation of network services. Beside forwarding and routing, this can be also used for additional functions, e.g., for security purposes. In this paper, we present a framework to systematically create security analytics for virtualized network services, specifically targeting the detection of cyber-attacks. Our framework largely automates the deployment of security sidecars into existing service templates and their interconnection to an external analytics platform. Notably, it leverages code augmentation techniques to dynamically inject and remove inspection probes without affecting service operation. We describe the implementation of a use case for the detection of DNS amplification attacks in virtualized 5G networks, and provide extensive evaluation of our innovative inspection and detection mechanisms. Our results demonstrate better efficiency with respect to existing network monitoring tools in terms of CPU usage, as well as good accuracy in detecting attacks even with variable traffic patterns.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Promoting sustainable transportation, ride-sourcing and dynamic ridesharing (DRS) services have transformative impacts on mobility, congestion, and emissions. As emerging mobility options, the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services has rarely been simultaneously examined. This study contributes to filling this gap by jointly analyzing the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services and examining how it varies across neighborhood-level built environment, transit accessibility and crime, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors. To achieve these objectives, unique geo-coded data containing millions of ride-sourcing and DRS trips in Chicago are spatially joined with up-to-date data on the built environment, transit accessibility, crime, active travel, and demographic factors. A novel Markov Random Field-based joint heterogeneous geo-additive copula framework is presented to simultaneously capture random, systematic, and spatial heterogeneity. Characterized by a Frank copula structure, the demand for ride-sourcing and DRS services exhibited a non-linear stochastic dependence pattern. With spatial heterogeneity and spillover effects, the stochastic dependence of ride-sourcing and DRS demand varied across time of day and was the strongest in compact and dense neighborhoods. Key aspects of the built environment related to urban design (pedestrian-oriented infrastructure), density, and land-use diversity were positively associated with ride-sourcing and DRS demand—suggesting that sustainable mobility goals can be achieved by continuing to invest in more walkable neighborhoods. Active travel and telecommuting were positively linked with ride-sourcing and DRS demand. Complementary and substitutive effects for transit accessibility were found. Results show that increasing transit accessibility in areas with low levels of accessibility (compared to those with high transit levels) could be more helpful in increasing the adoption of ride-sourcing and DRS services. Relative to ride-sourcing, the demand for DRS services appeared more responsive to improvements in pedestrian-infrastructure and transit accessibility. Quantification of non-linear associations with ceiling and overdose effects for the built environment, vehicle ownership, and transit accessibility provided deeper insights. The findings can help guide the development of policy interventions and investment decisions to further accelerate the adoption of mobility-on-demand systems. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urbancontext by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations andpresence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods: The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results: The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closerto their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offendinglocations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors andgenerators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions: By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime locationchoice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discusslimitations and make suggestions for future investigations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - To unravel the conditions of application of street eyes theory and defensible space theory as well as the reasons of their theoretical dispute, this study took the central urban area of Beijing as research area and systematically explored the impacts of the permeable built environment on theft crime and the moderation effects of social disorganization on such relationships by integrating crime opportunity theory and social ecology theory. Big data from multiple sources during 2016 to 2020, including court records, location-based service data, street view images, points of interest, and road networks were used together. The results indicate that characteristics of permeable built environment such as land use density, mixing degree of urban functions, road network density, and transparency of street buildings all have positive and significant associations with the density of theft crimes in general. Furthermore, the direction and intensity of incluence of built environment features on criminal activities vary depending on the social ecological factors of communities. In other words, the degrees of social disorganization moderate the links between permeable environment and theft distribution. With social disorganization exacerbating, including the increase in residential instability, visitor mobility, employee mobility, population heterogeneity, and socioeconomic disadvantages, the positive effects of permeable built environment on crime will be steadily magnified, which more conforms to the defensible space theory. On the contrary, street eyes theory has better explanatory power in communities with stable social structure and abundant social capital where street eyes can be activated so as to provide effective informal surveillance to ensure safety. Unfortunately, according to the critical value of moderators estimated by the regression models, the later situation is less common in Beijing, suggesting that defensible space theory is more applicable in the majority of communities and the safety risks would increase when applying the approach of New Urbanism. © 2022, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - The purpose is to explore the impact of the business environment optimization by Criminal Law Regulation (CLR) on Entrepreneurial Spirit (ES) and Enterprise Development (ED) and to provide a reference for subsequent related research. Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

AB  - Identity-based attacks (IBAs) are one of the most serious threats to wireless networks. Recently, there is an increasing interest in using the received signal strength (RSS) to detect IBAs in wireless networks. However, current schemes tend to generate excessive false alarms in the mobile scenario. In this paper, we propose a stronger Reciprocal Channel Variation-based Identification and classification (RCVIC) scheme for the mobile wireless networks, which exploits the reciprocity of the wireless fading channel and RSS variations naturally incurred by mobility to improve the detection performance. Different from current schemes only detect IBAs, RCVIC scheme conducts a multi-stage detection processes. If the IBAs are detected, RCVIC scheme partitions the received frames into two classes. The frames in the same class should be sent from the same senders, which could benefit the further analysis, such as network forensics, attacker localizing and trajectory analysis, etc. The feasibility of RCVIC are numerically evaluated through theoretical analysis and simulations. It is further validated through experiments using off-the-shelf 802.11 devices under different attacking patterns in real indoor and outdoor mobile scenarios. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The offender’s journey to crime has attracted much attention in mobility triangle research, whereas the journey to victimization and the spatial distance between the offender’s and the victim’s residences have been relatively less examined. This research fills this gap in the literature by examining spatial comparisons of variations in journey to crime, journey to victimization, and the distance between victim’s and suspect’s residences for five types of offenses. Crime data from the Houston Police Department from 2010 to 2013 were used to analyze the mobility triangle in five types of crime. The results show that the dynamics of travel pattern vary by demographic characteristics of the suspects and victims. It is also contingent on the types of crime. The proximity of offender’s and victim’s residences is closely related to the chance of crimes. The findings provide important implications for theory, policy and policing practice. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Motiveless homicides are usually defined as homicides in which a victim is killed by an offender and a motive was not determined by the police investigation. Motiveless does not mean that the police do not know the motive for the homicide, but rather that no other motive could accurately and objectively explain the reason for why the homicide occurred. However, this is especially problematic for the police because failing to establish a homicide motive is considered an investigative shortcoming. Due to the limited research conducted to date on motiveless homicides and the significant challenges they pose to investigators, the current study examines the geographic mobility patterns involved in these homicides. Using a sample of 194 solved cases of motiveless homicide from France, the criminal mobility triangle approach was used to explore their geographic patterns. Moreover, correlates of the entire criminal event were included for an in-depth understanding of these cases. The findings revealed various mobility patterns involved in motiveless homicides, combined with some specific correlates of the criminal event. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of the investigation of these crimes. © 2021, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.

AB  - Environmental criminological research on rape series is an understudied field due largely to deficiencies in official and publicly available data. Additionally, little is known about the spatial patterns of rapists with a large number of stranger rapes. With a unique integration and application of spatial, temporal, behavioral, forensic, investigative, and personal history data, we explore the geography of rape of a prolific, mobile serial stranger rapist identified through initiatives to address thousands of previously untested rape kits in two U.S. urban, neighboring jurisdictions. Rape kit data provide the opportunity for a more complete and comprehensive understanding of stranger rape series by linking crimes that likely never would have been linked if not for the DNA evidence. This study fills a knowledge gap by exploring the spatial offending patterns of extremely prolific serial stranger rapists. Through the lens of routine activities theory, we explore the motivated offender, the lack of capable guardianship (e.g., built environment), and the targeted victims. The findings have important implications for gaining practical and useful insight into rapists’ use of space and behavioral decision-making processes, effective public health interventions and prevention approaches, and urban planning strategies in communities subjected to repeat targeting by violent offenders. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The teenager community is the most affected community by cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Increasing social networks and facilitating teenager access to the Internet have increased the probability of cybercrimes. On the other hand, entertainment such as mobile and computer games is top-rated among teenagers. Teenagers' tendency to cybercrime may be influenced by individual, parent, social, economic and political factors. Studying the impact of social networks, mobile games and parents' religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is the primary goal of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a considerable change in the world and the lifestyle of all people. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was also affected by the special conditions of this virus. Changes in ICT and rapid access to it have empowered individuals and organizations, and people have increased civic participation and interaction through ICT. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created new challenges for the government and citizens and may cause new crimes. Cybercrime is a type of crime that occurs in a cyber environment. These crimes range from invasions of privacy to crimes in which the offender vaguely paralyzes the macroeconomic. In this research, 265 students of high schools and universities are used for collecting data by utilizing a survey. Measuring actions have been done in all surveys employing a Likert scale. The causal pattern is assessed through a constructional equation modeling procedure to study the scheme's validity and reliability. Findings: The outcomes have indicated that social networks have no significant relationship with teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Mobile games have a mild effect on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era, and parents' religious attitudes significantly impact teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications: Current research also has some restrictions that must be noticed in assessing the outcomes. First, sample research was selected from high schools and universities in one city. So, the size of the model is small, and the generalization of results is limited. Second, this research may have ignored other variables that affect the tendency of teenagers' to cybercrime. Future researchers intend to investigate the parents' upbringing system's impact on teenager's trend to cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Future research can also examine practical factors such as parental upbringing, attitudes toward technology development and virtual addiction in the COVID-19 era. Originality/value: In this study, teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is investigated, and a procedure is applied depending on a practical occasion. This article's offered sample provides a perfect framework for influencing parents' social networks, mobile games and religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - We conducted a small-area ecological longitudinal study to analyze neighborhood contextual influences on the spatio-temporal variations in intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) risk in a southern European city over an eight-year period. We used geocoded data of IPVAW cases with associated protection orders (n = 5867) in the city of Valencia, Spain (2011–2018). The city's 552 census block groups were used as the neighborhood units. Neighborhood-level covariates were: income, education, immigrant concentration, residential instability, alcohol outlet density, and criminality. We used a Bayesian autoregressive approach to spatio-temporal disease mapping. Neighborhoods with low levels of income and education and high levels of residential mobility and criminality had higher relative risk of IPVAW. Spatial patterns of high risk of IPVAW persisted over time during the eight-year period analyzed. Areas of stable low risk and with increasing or decreasing risk were also identified. Our findings link neighborhood disadvantage to the existence and persistence over time of spatial inequalities in IPVAW risk, showing that high risk of IPVAW can become chronic in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our analytic approach provides specific risk estimates at the small-area level that are informative for intervention purposes, and can be useful to assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts in reducing IPVAW. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The use of information technology is a cross-cutting actively developing element in the method of investigating mass riots, which in modern conditions acts as a factor in the success of this work. The article reveals the features of the criminal prosecution of riots using information technology. The main areas of using automated data banks and information retrieval systems in the investigation of mass riots are determined. Domestic and foreign possibilities of using information technologies in the organization of investigative work, in accounting and control over the materials of criminal cases on mass riots, in fixing the circumstances of crimes and in proving them are shown. The structure of the program for making and supporting the decision to create a specialized investigative group designed to work in emergency conditions is determined. As part of such a group, it is proposed to immediately organize its own information center with its own databank of episodes and persons, taking into account the primary materials on the facts of riots using the programs intended for this. For the formation of information about the general situation of mass riots, special mathematical models for the study of space-time patterns are intended. Recommendations are formulated to survey a large area and recreate a unified picture of disturbances using quadcopters. To determine the involvement of a person in riots, it is recommended to compare data from various electronic sources, such as email correspondence, electronic documents and mobile communication log files, the history of search queries in web browsers, cards and payment systems, etc. The modern judicial practice of proving participation in mass riots using, along with photo and video materials, the corresponding fragments of records also placed in electronic means is assessed. © 2021 Saint Petersburg State University.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities, as measured by changes in public transport passenger numbers. Method: The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors. Results: Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that some of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the findings suggested that the changes in mobility explain part of the declines observed, with important variations per crime type. Conclusion: The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explicitly test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This Special Issue is a collection of seven papers that seek to better our understanding of how urban mobility relates to crime patterns, and how day to day movement of people in urban spaces (urban mobility) is related to spatio-temporal patterns of crime. It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both ‘crime type’ appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the ‘dynamic denominator’ challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation. This special issue explores a range of potential solutions to this including mobile/cell phone data, transportation data, land use data, and other possible measures to address this. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Fintech is having a profound impact in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because it offers more financial inclusion. In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of Fintech, base of the pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the SSA context. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources. The authors interviewed respondents from the Sierra Leone Fintech Association and four BOP entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. Findings: The authors find that Fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. FinTech also offers growth possibilities for BOP entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. At the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing BOP entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development. Research limitations/implications: This study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between BOP entrepreneurship, social value creation and Fintech. For example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like Fintech. However, in a country like Sierra Leone, which has experienced both a civil war and Ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by BOP inhabitants. Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on Fintech's application in BOP contexts. Practical implications: A key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits. Fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. Fintech offers BOP entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating Fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more BOP entrepreneurs using these services. Social implications: The authors find that at the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of BOP consumers who interact with case firms. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on BOP entrepreneurship and social value creation by Fintech services in an SSA context. It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's Fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or Fintech firms. Finally, there is a specific focus on BOP entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A rich body of trans-disciplinary scholarship explores the relationship between technology, power, and gender injustice. However, political science analyses of violence against public-facing women have so far largely overlooked the peculiarities of technology-facilitated attacks. On the other hand, studies of digital gender-based abuse from the fields of psychology, criminology, gender and media studies mostly adopt an individual-level focus on either perpetrators or survivors. In the present chapter, I propose to connect these different streams of literature to provide a multi-level conceptualisation of digital violence against politically active women. Furthermore, I integrate a set of concepts and propositions from feminist and institutional theories, which I use to link micro-aspects of violent digital interactions to global patterns of white male radicalisation, as well as to the mobilisation strategies of political operators seeking to capitalise on the support of anti-feminist groups. In so doing, I shed light on emerging empirical trends, systematise existing knowledge, and advance theory-building efforts on the micro-foundations of patriarchal power and their ties to contemporary socio-political developments. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Gait recognition, which is a biometric identifier for individual walking patterns, is utilized in many applications, such as criminal investigation and identification systems, because it can be applied at a long distance and requires no explicit cooperation of the subjects. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition, and several methods in previous studies have used depth information captured by RGB-D cameras. However, RGB-D cameras are limited in terms of their measurement distance and are difficult to access outdoors. In recent years, real-time multi-layer 3D LiDAR, which can obtain 3D range images of a target at ranges of over 100 m, has attracted significant attention for use in autonomous mobile robots, serving as eyes for obstacles detection and navigation. Compared with cameras, such 3D LiDAR has rarely been used for biometrics owing to its low spatial resolution. However, considering the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, such as the robustness of the illumination conditions, long measurement distances, and wide-angle scanning, the approach has the potential to be applied outdoors as a biometric identifier. The present paper describes a gait recognition system, called 2V-Gait, which is robust to variations in the walking direction of a subject and the distance measured from the 3D LiDAR. To improve the performance of gait recognition, we leverage the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, which are not included in regular cameras. Extensive experiments on our dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This article analyses the division of labour and patterns of elite reproduction that characterize international criminal justice as a market of services. Using a sociological framework and building on empirical data on 996 professional agents, the analysis outlines how the market in and around the international criminal courts is structured by three different social groups that dominate the formal roles of judges, prosecutors and defence counsel. The article investigates the relative positionality of these groups highlighting the low degree of mobility between them. It also demonstrates the reproduction of male, global north professionals at the top of these groups, pointing towards intersectional dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in this market. To deepen the analysis of divisions of labour and reproduction of status, the article turns to a closer analysis of the patterns of expertise upon which elite status is built and how it links the three groups to the wider market of international criminal justice. The relations between the identified social groups, the elite of which have very particular characteristics dominated by global north professionals, educations and networks, structure a core part of the market of international criminal justice and formats the social fault lines behind its normative debates.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Owing to the limited data protection of various popular online services in some countries, such as taxi hailing and ordering takeouts, many users presently encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. The situation may be aggravated when criminals pretend to be such service delivery staff, threatening the user individuals as well as the society. In addition, numerous people experience excessive digital marketing and fraudulent phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, which does not work for the identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones might exhibit their application preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession-related information. This offers researchers and engineers a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies and regulations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation). We observe that appropriate statistical methods can offer an effective means to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, thus enabling the identification of the types of mobile phone callers without privacy concerns. In this paper, we develop CPFinder —- a system that exploits privacy-preserving mobile data to automatically identify callers who are divided into four categories of users: taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters, and normal users (other professions). Our evaluation of an anonymized dataset of 1,282 users over a period of 3 months in Shanghai City shows that the CPFinder can achieve accuracies of more than 75.0% and 92.4% for multiclass and binary classifications, respectively. © 2021 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications

AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid advancement of digital technology has encouraged its use in all aspects of life, including the workplace, education, and leisure. As technology advances, so does the number of users, which leads to an increase in criminal activity and demand for a cyber-crime investigation. Mobile phones have been the epicenter of illegal activity in recent years. Sensitive information is transferred due to numerous technical applications available at one’s fingertips, which play an essential part in cyber-crime attacks in the mobile environment. Mobile forensic is a technique of recovering or retrieving digital evidence from mobile devices so that it may be submitted in court for legal procedures. As a result, mobile phone data is essential for obtaining evidence in elements of mobile forensic data ana-lysis. So, in this paper, we offer a method for detecting suspect drug-dealing patterns in mobile devices utilizing forensic and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Machine Learning algorithms are used to uncover the pattern in an original dataset, and performance measurements are used to assess the suggested system. In our approach, Logistic Regression (LR) manifests 95% of the highest accuracy in terms of count vector whereas, the BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) also achieved 95% of accuracy in terms of TFIDF. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

AB  - Security perception and Fear of Crime (FoC) in urban scenarios have the potential to affect travel behavior, changing people's travel choices and patterns. In this sense, the feeling of being “safe” or “at-risk” in public transportation not only depends on observable factors like illumination, travel companionship or transport crowding, but also on unobservable individual-specific latent attributes, among which fear of crime constitutes a major issue to consider in transport security policy-making. This study aimed to describe the relationships among sociodemographic features, travel situations, system-design features, and the Fear of Crime at three different locations (buses, bus stops, and stations) of the BRT system of Barranquilla (Colombia). Using an image-based survey applied in Barranquilla, data was collected from a full-sample of 500 adult users (64% females and 36% males) of the system. It was estimated a hybrid choice model to include location-based fear of crime in public transportation perception of risk, along with attributes related to (e.g.) surveillance, crowding, time of the day, and companionship. The relation between fear of crime and perception of security in public transportation is negative and highly significant. FoC inside the bus has the highest negative effect on the utility, followed by bus stops and BRT Stations, for which it remains non-significant. Gender (being a female user) was the strongest FoC predictor. Moreover, it was found that the higher is the user's income, the lower is the fear of crime reported for each one of these three types of location. Overall, the inclusion of the fear of crime perception in the estimation of the hybrid choice model enhances the model fit. Also, the user-related findings of this study at different locations provide a better understanding of the decision-making process and the predictors of fear of crime in BRT systems. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Mobile devices and social networks provide communication opportunities among the young generation, which increases vulnerability and cybercrimes activities. A recent survey reports that cyberbullying and cyberstalking constitute a developing issue among youngsters. This paper focuses on cyberbullying detection in mobile phone text by retrieving with the help of an oxygen forensics toolkit. We describe the data collection using forensics technique and a corpus of suspicious activities like cyberbullying annotation from mobile phones and carry out a sequence of binary classification experiments to determine cyberbullying detection. We use forensics techniques, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to exploit suspicious patterns to help the forensics investigation where every evidence contributes to the case. Experiments on a real-time dataset reveal better results for the detection of cyberbullying content. The Random Forest in ML approach produces 87% of accuracy without SMOTE technique, whereas the value of F1Score produces a good result with SMOTE technique. The LSTM has 92% of validation accuracy in the DL algorithm compared with Dense and BiLSTM algorithms. © 2021 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smartphones as ubiquitous gadgets are rapidly becoming more intelligent and context-aware as sensing, networking, and processing capabilities advance. These devices provide users with a comprehensive platform to undertake activities such as socializing, communicating, sending and receiving e-mails, and storing and accessing personal data at any time and from any location. Nowadays, smartphones are used to store a multitude of private and sensitive data including bank account information, personal identifiers, account passwords and credit card information. Many users remain permanently signed in and, as a result, their mobile devices are vulnerable to security and privacy risks through assaults by criminals. Passcodes, PINs, pattern locks, facial verification, and fingerprint scans are all susceptible to various assaults including smudge attacks, side-channel attacks, and shoulder-surfing attacks. To solve these issues, this research introduces a new continuous authentication framework called DeepAuthen, which identifies smartphone users based on their physical activity patterns as measured by the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors on their smartphone. We conducted a series of tests on user authentication using several deep learning classifiers, including our proposed deep learning network termed DeepConvLSTM on the three benchmark datasets UCI-HAR, WISDM-HARB and HMOG. Results demonstrated that combining various motion sensor data obtained the highest accuracy and energy efficiency ratio (EER) values for binary classification. We also conducted a thorough examination of the continuous authentication outcomes, and the results supported the efficacy of our framework. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - To overcome the problems of low efficiency and poor security in the process of digital forensics, a digital forensics method based on direct if sampling for 5G communication system is proposed. In this method, the modulation parameters of the communication signal are obtained by the feature extraction algorithm of the receiver's in pulse signal, and the ontology model of digital forensics is constructed based on the ontology theory: analyse the disk image and judge the file category according to the pattern feature recognition results of the radiation source signal in 5g communication system; determine the hash value and information entropy, and generate the key index; summarise the digital forensics results and generate the digital forensics report. The simulation results show that the data processing efficiency is over 25/Mbps, and the successful attack rate in the security performance test is 2.89%.

AB  - Nowadays, the Internet has become a crucial part of almost every area of our lives. Online transactions, purchases, and transactions are growing exponentially on e-commerce sites. Similarly, the number of online scammers increased, and the recent increase in credit card payments makes credit card fraud a very serious threat. Institutions lose huge sums of money every year due to fraud. As these agencies tighten their security measures, scammers are constantly looking for new ways to use their nefarious methods. Well-known online payment methods include credit and debit cards, internet banking, and mobile banking. Because of its easy usage, people tend to prefer credit card payments, and as a result, fraudulent transactions related to these types of transactions are increasing. In this article, we propose a method to detect credit card fraud transactions using a neural network autoencoder. The credit card fraud detection problem is generally considered a classification problem. This requires rebalancing any data imbalances present in the dataset. In this article, we propose to treat this problem as an outlier detection problem that does not require a solution. This article also describes various parameters to consider when training a model. We also published the experimental results and conclusions. The goal of our project is to develop a robust fraud detection system that is inherently dynamic and rapidly adapts to changing fraud patterns and requires little or no manual processing during model inference and training. The proposed system architecture provides estimates of the ROC AUC(area under the receiver operating curve) at 0.9212, 0.8976, 0.9378, 0.9489, and 0.9512 at all multiples, with a cumulative ROC AUC of 0.9314 without manual coding.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Crime Geography and spatial analysis of crime has gained great momentum lately, coupled with the advancement of geographic information science (GIScience) and big data in human mobility. According to (Liu in Oxford Bibliographies in Geogr 2021), crime geography and crime analysis normally cover spatio-temporal crime pattern detection, crime explanation, crime prediction, crime prevention and crime intervention assessment. The acronym of DEPPA captures these five elements. Pattern detection uncovers spatio-temporal patterns of crime distribution, such as crime hotspots. Crime explanation aims to discern major contributing factors based on multivariate regression modeling and machine learning. Crime prediction forecasts future crime patterns using machine learning and other predictivemethods. Crime prevention devises targeted intervention strategies such as hot spot policing, based on historical and future crime patterns. Assessment examines the effectiveness of crime prevention, to find out if crime is reduced in the targeted area and whether the nearby areas are affected by the intervention. This chapter summarizes some of the latest progresses and challenges of crime geography and crime analysis along the issues of the unit of analysis and spatial scale, comparison analysis, new data and new variables, crime prevention and assessment, and the spatio-temporal mismatch problem. © Higher Education Press 2022.

AB  - Smartphones are prone to SMS phishing due to the rapid growth in the availability of smart mobile technologies driven by Internet connections. Also, detecting phishing SMS is a challenging task due to the unstructured nature of SMS text data with non-linear complex correlations. In this concern, considering the recent advancements in the domain of cybersecurity, we have proposed a hybrid deep learning framework that extracts robust features from SMS texts followed by an automatic detection of Phishing SMS. Due to combining the potential capability of individual models into one hybrid framework, it has outperformed various other individual machine learning and deep learning models. The proposed Phishing Detection framework is an effective hybrid combination of pretrained transformer model, MPNet (Masked and Permuted Language Modeling), with supervised ConvNets (CNN) and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). It is intended to successfully detect unstructured short phishing text messages that contain complex patterns. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - This study used spatial interaction modeling to examine whether origin-specific and destination-specific factors, distance decay effects, and spatial structures explain the criminal trips of residential burglars. In total, 4041 criminal trips committed by 892 individual offenders who lived and committed residential burglary in Tokyo were analyzed. Each criminal trip was allocated to an origin–destination pair created from the combination of potential departure and arrival zones. The following explanatory variables were created from an external dataset and used: residential population, density of residential burglaries, and mobility patterns of the general population. The origin-specific factors served as indices of not only the production of criminal trips, but also the opportunity to commit crimes in the origin zones. Moreover, the criminal trips were related to the mobility patterns of the general population representing daily leisure (noncriminal) trips, and relatively large origin-and destination-based spatial spillover effects were estimated. It was shown that considering not only destination-specific but also origin-specific factors, spatial structures are important for investigating the criminal trips of residential burglars. The current findings could be applicable to future research on geographical profiling by incorporating neighborhood-level factors into existing models. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes in human activity via extensive lockdowns worldwide. Large-scale shifts in human activities bestowed both positive and negative impacts on wildlife. Unforeseen reduction in the activities of people allowed wildlife to venture outside of forested areas to exploit newfound habitats and increase their diurnal activities. While on a negative note, a reduction in forest-related law enforcement led to substantial increase in illegal activities such as poaching. We conducted mammal surveys in forested and nearby farmland of a fragmented landscape under two distinct scenarios: pre-lockdown and lockdown. An increase in poaching activities observed during the lockdown period in our study area provided us an opportunity to investigate the impact of the lockdown on wildlife. Camera trapping data of four highly poached mammalian species, namely black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis, wild pig Sus scrofa, four-horned antelope Tetracerus quadricornis and leopard Panthera pardus were considered to investigate activity patterns and habitat use, to understand the effect of lockdown. The pre-lockdown period was used as a baseline to compare any changes in trends of activity patterns, habitat use and detection probabilities of targeted species. Species-specific changes in activity patterns of study species were observed, with an increment in daytime activity during lockdown. The results showed species-specific increase in the habitat use of study species during lockdown. Reduction in the detection probability of all study species was witnessed. This is the first study to highlight the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the responses of wildlife by considering the changes in their temporal and spatial use before and during lockdown. The knowledge gained on wildlife during reduced human mobility because of the pandemic aid in understanding the effect of human disturbances and developing future conservation strategies in the shared space, to manage both wildlife and humans. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The externalized European “migration management” in West Africa has technologically modernized and militarized border posts. This threatens visa-free travel, freedom of settlement and borderland economies in parts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It has interrupted historical mobility patterns, depleted the diversity of mobility practices and criminalized regional economies. At the same time, one can observe intensified and asymmetrical violent conflict in some of these borderlands. By taking the Kantchari-Makalondi borderland as a case study we analysed the relations between migration policies, insecurity, forced immobility and economic decline. Our observations and interviews with migrants, traders, security forces and borderlanders lead us to question conventional narratives on border control and African mobilities as a binary relation between Africa and Europe. Instead, they foreground the multiple practices of (im)mobility in these spaces: the circulation and blockage of travelers, merchandise, surveillance technologies, and military interventions and their impact on security and livelihoods. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Cities – and, in general, urban agglomerations – have in recent years become foci of social science research and policy interest. Prominent attention has been given to agglomeration advantages, mobility patterns, urban decay, inequity problems, residents’ quality of life, safety and crime, labour and housing markets, public amenities, and urban planning issues. Less attention however, has been paid to the basic question: what makes the city a ‘real’ and attractive city? This question prompts essentially a research challenge on the ‘raison d'etre’ of cities, in particular on the residential satisfaction and quality-of-life motives of urban inhabitants. The present paper aims to pinpoint attractiveness characteristics of cities based on perceptions of urban quality by residents and their affinity with city life. This paper offers a micro-based (individual) assessment of motives and appreciations of citizens, in terms of their love for the city. A typological distinction will be made between the ‘soul’ of the city (its spirit, history, cultural identity, ambiance, social capital, etc.) and the ‘body’ of the city (its built environment, infrastructure, public amenities, supply of housing, green areas, etc.). The empirical analysis – applied to the four largest cities in Sweden (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmoe and Umea) – will be undertaken in two steps: (i) an exploratory statistical analysis of the findings from an extensive micro-based survey questionnaire among inhabitants in these four urban agglomerations; (ii) an explanatory evaluation of the individual appreciation scores using a regression approach. Our results show that the ‘City Love Index’ is a useful construct that can be decomposed into ‘soul’ and ‘body’ aspects of the city. Our multivariate regression analysis demonstrates clearly that both factors matter. More detailed results suggest that it is the perceptions regarding the city's ‘walkability’ and ‘vibrancy’, both part of the ‘soul’ of the city, that have a significant influence on the City Love Index - for all cities studied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The telecommunications industry experiences a fundamental transition towards 5G networks. Based on our research, it can be concluded that 5G still faces security challenges. In the frame of our analysis, we have determined several security concerns. It must also be mentioned that lately, the scientists have found different security problems in the existing 5G networks that give hacker the opportunity to install the undesirable code into the 5G system and perform undesirable actions. The corresponding attacks are MNmap, MiTM and the Battery drain attack. Therefore, it is mandatory to design new architectures for 5G and the future networks, which can be defined as 6G ones, for this, it is obligatory to provide the new machine learning algorithms, which will give the scientists the opportunity to provide high-level security. The article analyzes the existing security problems of 5G architecture. Based on the research, a new cyber security model is offered, which is based AI/ML algorithms. It envisions the fundamental components, the firewall, intrusion detection and intrusion protection systems. We apply the offered security model into already existing architecture of 5G. The paper essentially describes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is a part of proposed model. The IDS implements a comprehensive methodology for the identification of the attacks to which the 5G systems can be vulnerable. These attack patterns include MNmap, MiTM and the Battery drain attacks. The methodology is described in the paper. The article analyzes the efficiency of the described model, through the design and implementation of a comprehensive testing laboratory. In the laboratory there are a server and 50 raspberry pi, with fifty 4G modems, which are needed in order to make the simulation of the attacks on the corresponding server. The paper also suggests the improvement approach, which could be integrated into the system in future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Globalization has opened practically every country in the globe to tourism and commerce today. In every region, the volume of vehicles traveling through border crossings has increased significantly. Smartcards and radio frequency identification (RFID) have been proposed as a new method of identifying and authenticating passengers, products, and vehicles. However, the usage of smartcards and RFID tag cards for vehicular border crossings continues to suffer security and flexibility challenges. Providing a vehicle’s driver a smartcard or RFID tag card may result in theft, loss, counterfeit, imitation, or vehicle transmutation. RFID sticker tags would replace RFID tags as vehicle border passes to solve the mentioned problem. The RFID sticker tag adheres to the windscreen, side screen, dash, hood, or door of the vehicle, or any other acceptable location. Any damage or stripping from the installed location may cause data corruption and cannot be reused. Overall, these sticker tags will make the border crossings more secure and efficient. This article focuses on designing a rectangular-shaped RFID sticker tag antenna made of graphene sheets as a possible solution for smart border crossings. The proposed antenna is mathematically designed and analyzed with CST software to determine the optimum parameters. The design parameters are then used to create an antenna on a prepared graphene sheet. The performance results are carried out with CST software and a network analyzer. The designed RFID antenna stick on a car windscreen offers approximately 900 MHz bandwidth over the frequency range from 1.8 GHz to 2.7 GHz with an average gain of 1.23 dBi at the frequency to be used of 2.4 GHz microwave RFID band. The radiation is an omnidirectional pattern. The proposed graphene-sheet rectangular-shape monopole antenna is compact, low-cost, and bendable to fit into the windscreen of a car while retaining excellent wave propagation capabilities. These findings illustrate the suggested antenna’s potential as an RFID tag antenna in a vehicular smart border pass system. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The detection of moving objects by machine vision is a hot research direction in recent years. It is widely used in military, medical, transportation, and agriculture. With the rapid development of UAV technology, as well as the high mobility of UAVs and the wide range of high-altitude vision, the target detection technology based on UAV vision is applied to traffic management such as vehicle tracking and detection of vehicle violations. The moving target detection technology in this study is based on the YOLOv3 algorithm. It implements moving vehicle tracking by means of Mean-Shift and Kalman filtering. In this paper, the Gaussian background difference technology is used to analyze the illegal behavior of the vehicle, and the color feature extraction technology is used to identify and locate the license plate, and the information of the illegal vehicle is entered into the database. The experiment compares the moving target detection of UAV vision and the traditional target detection in four aspects: recognition accuracy, recognition speed, manual time, and divergent results. The results show that the average accuracy rates of UAV vision-based moving target detection and traditional pattern recognition are 98.4% and 87.8%, respectively. The recognition speeds are 24.9 (vehicles/sec) and 10.6 (vehicles/sec), respectively. However, the artificial time and divergence results of moving target detection based on UAV vision are only 1/3 of the traditional mode. The moving target detection based on UAV vision has a better moving target detection ability.  © 2022 Sining Cheng et al.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT), such as a UAV swarm and a car platoon, comprises intelligent mobile and wireless devices with highly heterogeneous sensors and actuators. For managing them, logically centralized management such as Software-defined Network (SDN) is more beneficial than conventional distributed and ad hoc management approaches in terms of performance, scalability, and flexibility. However, the security issues for centralized management of heterogeneous IoT systems have not been explored well. The existing centralized security countermeasures are not enhancing IoT's security issues, mainly due to the control path vulnerability. Specifically, a wormhole attack is one of the most challenging yet detrimental security issues in IoT. Attackers can easily manipulate the centralized SDN controllers by spoofing the wireless control messages. In particular, if a wormhole attacker can exploit spoofing attacks against SDN controllers, SDN is hard to detect the wormhole attackers.This paper proposes a novel wormhole countermeasure algorithm named an ML-AWARE (Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Wormhole Attack Resonance) against attackers with various intelligent spoofing capabilities. ML-AWARE proposes a double-step k-means clustering for identifying wormhole attackers, denoising scattered errors and classifying the core area of the wormhole attackers. By clustering with the neighbor counts, ML-AWARE exploits the distance between clusters, concentration patterns, and the size of a cluster. We conducted detailed research using both analysis and simulations. Our simulation results show that ML-AWARE can identify wormhole attackers and counter numerous intelligent wormhole attacks without requiring special devices. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Learning the embeddings for urban regions from human mobility data can reveal the functionality of regions, and then enables the correlated but distinct tasks such as crime prediction. Human mobility data contains rich but abundant information, which yields to the comprehensive region embeddings for cross domain tasks. In this paper, we propose multi-graph fusion networks (MGFN) to enable the cross domain prediction tasks. First, we integrate the graphs with spatio-temporal similarity as mobility patterns through a mobility graph fusion module. Then, in the mobility pattern joint learning module, we design the multi-level cross-attention mechanism to learn the comprehensive embeddings from multiple mobility patterns based on intra-pattern and inter-pattern messages. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MGFN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.35% improvement. https://github.com/wushangbin/MGFN. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have the ability to generate their mobility pattern in advance and share it with other vehicles or a central location. This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contacts' conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, Bangladesh has started moving its transportation vision towards achieving sustainability goals such as increasing bicycle infrastructure, sidewalks, reducing air pollution, etc. To contribute to the ongoing discussion, we explored factors that influence the use of bicycles for different trip purposes in Rajshahi, a medium-sized city in Bangladesh. A face-to-face household survey was conducted to collect individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics, their travel patterns for different trip purposes, and perceptions of the built environment. We developed four Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) models to understand the influence of latent perceptions on bicycling for commuting and non-commuting (i.e., grocery shopping, going for tea, and recreational) trips. The analysis indicates that women are more likely to choose a bike for commuting trips but are less likely to use bikes for recreational trips. The results also show that the choice of commuting by bicycle is positively associated with commuting distance and negatively associated with residential land use. Walkability perception has a significant positive association with the choice of bikes for commuting and non-commuting trips. Road safety perception for active travel is positively associated with bike choice for recreational trips, and crime perception of the neighborhood is negatively associated with bike choice for grocery trips. The results from this study will be helpful for policymakers to understand and improve the built environment to attract individuals towards bike use. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Crime prevention in society has persisted in being a significant issue that needs to be controlled through efficient investigation processes. Among these methods, biometric facial recognition is particularly effective because it is adaptable and non-intrusive. Face recognition has grown in popularity due to its numerous uses in entertainment, smart cards, information security, law enforcement, and surveillance. It is a vital topic in pattern recognition, computer vision, and image processing. For feature extraction, two basic methods are used: Appearance-based and model-based. Methods based on appearance employ global Face identification using representations. Model-based face approaches seek to create a human face model that captures facial diversity. The distance between the vectors of two photographs is defined as image similarity. This research primarily analyzed open-source Face Recognition algorithms based on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) model. The study will be of significant consideration in integrating Face Recognition technology on the current Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) using Minutiae Structure. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This article focuses on the close association between inequality and punishment observed over recent decades at a macro level, at least in some regions of the world. A review of the empirical literature first provides an overview of the different types of variables mobilized to try to understand this complex relationship. The aim of the empirical part is to explore the potential role of attitudes towards inequality in this relationship, on the basis of country-level data available for West European countries. The results do not support the idea that a more meritocratic ethos at the country level would create the connection between inequality and punishment. On the contrary, they suggest the persistence of a systemic link independently of attitudinal variables. However, by showing that, the greater the inequality, the more the population calls for redistributive intervention by the state, and the more it also calls for punitive intervention, the findings could suggest another pattern. This moves away from a rather deterministic perspective to highlight the room for manoeuvre for social change. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In recent years, Internet of Things has not only promoted the continuous development of e-commerce transaction but also brought loop-hole to the fraud gangs who always utilize mobile devices to commit fraud crimes. For example, fraud gangs are usually organized to purchase commodities at low prices in e-commerce promotions. They benefit from the price spread by reselling commodities at high prices. In the past few years, the transaction fraud caused serious financial losses to merchants in e-commerce platform. To detect the fraudulent user and behavior effectively, a multiview graph clustering-based abnormal detection model is developed in this paper. In the proposed model, two fraudulent behavior patterns are proposed by abstracting the e-commerce network as a heterogeneous information graph. On this basis, two user-similarity graphs are reorganized from the heterogeneous graph with the help of different metapaths. Subsequently, in order to capture the corresponding fraudulent behavior patterns, the above two graphs are encoded into user embeddings and assigned to specific clusters in respective views. Finally, the consensus detection result is produced by fusing the complementary information of different views in a joint multiview learning framework. As we know, our work is the first one that uses multiview graph clustering in e-commerce fraud detection, which will provide a new research perspective for fraud detection in e-commerce platform. Extensive experiments are conducted on real and semisynthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.  © 2022 HangYuan Du et al.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates criminal nomadism—an individual's propensity to engage in continuous or intermittent interurban travel as a way to cope with the consequences of their criminal lifestyle and/or as a strategy to adapt to the reality of being a “career criminal.” Methods: The criminal-career itinerary across Canada of 448 men convicted of sex offenses was reconstructed through individual interviews and analysis of detailed criminal records. Five distinct components of criminal nomadism (i.e., trips, nodes, paths, range, and mesolevel activity space), inspired by crime pattern theory, are suggested and analyzed. Results: Results show that criminal nomadism is the reality of young and educated Whites who have a prolific criminal career interspersed with long incarceration sentences. Nomadic offenders did not wander freely and randomly, but rather seemed to be looking for opportunities and privacy. Sex-offending variables did not make a significant contribution to predictions, suggesting that criminal nomadism is more a general offending phenomenon than something specific to sex offending. Conclusions: This study provides supporting evidence that an extensive criminal career is generally associated with a geographically scattered and nomadic lifestyle. Implications for public policies and future studies are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) is a relatively new mobility classification task in which anonymous trajectories are linked to the users who generated them. With applications ranging from personalized recommendations to criminal activity detection, TUL has received increasing attention over the past five years. While research has focused mainly on learning deep representations that capture complex spatio-temporal mobility patterns unique to individual users, we demonstrate that visit patterns are highly unique among users and thus simple heuristics applied directly to the raw data are sufficient to solve TUL. More specifically, we demonstrate that a single check-in per trajectory is enough to correctly predict the identity of the user up to 85% of the time. Moreover, by using a non-parametric classifier, we scale up TUL to over 100k users which is an increase over state-of-theart by three orders of magnitude. Extensive empirical analysis on four real-world datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare, Gowalla and Weeplaces) compares our findings to state-of-the-art results, and more importantly validates our claim that TUL is easier than commonly believed. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Anomaly-based impersonation detection consists in constructing typical profiles based on users’ frequent behaviors and comparing them with new data. The underlying idea is that a very different behavior may indicate possible fraud, i.e., someone trying to impersonate the user. Most research in the area aims to use spatiotemporal data broadly available from ubiquitous location sensors, e.g., GPS, mobile telephony, beacons, and Physical Access Control Systems. Many studies achieved good performance in finding social bonds among users. Our previous work Silva and Sichman (2019) combined concepts from previous research and proposed using social groups to construct mobility profiles to enhance anomaly-detection. This paper extends our previous work and explores the feasibility of using spatiotemporal mobility profiles enriched with group patterns for fraud detection in Physical Access Control Systems. An empirical analysis is conducted using data from two real-world datasets, and results show that it is feasible to add companions activities information to mobility profiles to enhance anomaly-based impersonation attack detection. © 2021

AB  - The neighborhood effect of environment characteristics has been an important topic in social sciences that are concerned with people's behaviors. However, defining a neighborhood and its aggregation scales are difficult challenges for the studies using neighborhood characteristics. Previous studies generally adopted fixed administrative units as the neighborhood and chose the same scale for all the variables due to data availability. Aggregation scales have a significant influence on examining the relationships between area-based input variables and outcome variables, but how to optimize the scale for each variable has been less investigated. This study proposes a multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework for simultaneously determining the optimal scale for each neighborhood environment variable and building an optimized multiscale model. First, we developed multiscale extraction methods for the socioeconomic and built environment characteristics within overlapping neighborhoods based on different types of data, including fine-grained mobile phone user data and point of interest data. Next, we proposed a random forest-based scale optimization method to quantify the impact of scales and determined an optimal spatial scale for each variable. Third, we used urban burglary risk modeling as an example, to demonstrate the usefulness of the scale optimization method. In the comparison, the model using an optimized multiscale feature set (R2 = 0.843, F1 score = 0.797 for high-risk samples) achieved better accuracy than all the models using fixed-scale combination feature sets. Moreover, the results revealed that there might be differences in the optimal scale of different neighborhood environment characteristics and demonstrated the effectiveness of our scale optimization method. Our multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework is well suited for assessing the neighborhood effect in social sciences. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Public transportation agencies call for an intuitive, interactive, and reusable visualization tool to detect patterns of crime (i.e. pickpockets and gangs) or missing commuters on public transportation systems. Few existing visualization techniques have visually explored mobility correlations of targets and their companions, who are characterized in diverse mobility types, by using discrete travel hints extracted from a massive amount of data. To fill this gap, a visual analytical system is provided to conduct a group-based and individual-based exploration of mobility correlations of passengers of interest, based on an auto integration of multiple queries. How passengers differ from or correlate with each other are further examined based on their spatiotemporal distributions in trajectories and ODs. Real-world case studies, as well as user feedback made by 30 participants, demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in detecting specific targets and their companions featured in diverse mobility types, or in characterizing their spatiotemporal aggregation patterns for a further tracking on public transportation systems. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The study of geographic mobility through geospatial analysis and journey-to-crime approaches has made progress in environmental criminology, finding most offenders commit crime close to their residence. However, extant literature on serial homicide and geographic mobility is scarce, specifically lacking a comprehensive appraisal of relative research. To gain a better understanding of the geographic mobility patterns of serial homicide offenders, we must determine the current status of literature in this area, to figure out where to go in terms of future research. Therefore, the following study is a scoping review of existing literature on geographic mobility and serial homicide and four associated typologies (Holmes & DeBurger’s Geographic typology, Hickey’s Mobility typology, Canter’s Circle typology, and Rossmo’s Hunting Style typology) to achieve the following: (1) Comprehensively evaluate literature regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and four associated typologies to establish the current status of research; (2) uncover potential literature gaps; and (3) provide future research recommendations. Literature sources (N = 43) on serial homicide and geographic mobility (1985–2018) were examined. While findings recognize the relevance of mobility functions in serial homicide investigations, gaps in literature were evident regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and the four associated typologies. Findings also reveal that systematic research in this field is limited. Policy implications and future research recommendations are discussed. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Oceans have always been arenas of crime, drugs and human trafficking, and poaching. When such violations occur on fishing boats, they fall under the rubric of “fisheries crime.” Political scientists and economists have tended to assume that these criminal fishers simply abandon their legal occupation and take up illegal practices, labelled “transnational organized fisheries crime” by the United Nations. On the other hand, some scholars have also argued that subsidized and militarized fishers in the South China Sea are simply acting as instruments of their states’ geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations, non-enforcement of regulations, and incentives. Such present-centric approaches both obscure the modalities of fishers’ embodied skills and knowledge and their motivations, and downplay the inter-ethnic networks that connected different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting the spike in maritime trespass in (and out of) the South China Sea, this article combines ethnography and historiography to show how fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader, smuggler, and militia. I propose the concept of occupational slippage as a way of going beyond the fiction of fishing as mono-occupational and theorizing the realities of fishers as mobile maritime actors who enact and conceal multiple—simultaneous and consecutive—livelihood strategies while navigating not just seas, but also markets and territorial sovereignties. Thus, I argue that the fishers’ practices reflect wider interconnections between modern, state-supported, and technology-driven fisheries with older pre-nation-state patterns of mobility and knowledge accumulated through generations, producing new forms of versatility that operate under the states’ radars. © 2022, Institute for Ethnographic Research.

AB  - Today's supply chains heavily rely on cyber-physical systems such as intelligent transportation, online shopping, and E-commerce. It is advantageous to track goods in real-time by web-based registration and authentication of products after any substantial change or relocation. Despite recent advantages in technology-based tracking systems, most supply chains still rely on plainly printed tags such as barcodes and Quick Response (QR) codes for tracking purposes. Although affordable and efficient, these tags convey no security against counterfeit and cloning attacks, raising privacy concerns. It is a critical matter since a few security breaches in merchandise databases in recent years has caused crucial social and economic impacts such as identity loss, social panic, and loss of trust in the community. This paper considers an end-to-end system using dendrites as nano-resolution visual identifiers to secure supply chains. Dendrites are formed by generating fractal metallic patterns on transparent substrates through an electrochemical process, which can be used as secure identifiers due to their natural randomness, high entropy, and unclonable features. The proposed framework compromises the back-end program for identification and authentication, a web-based application for mobile devices, and a cloud database. We review architectural design, dendrite operational phases (personalization, registration, inspection), a lightweight identification method based on 2D graph-matching, and a deep 3D image authentication method based on Digital Holography (DH). A two-step search is proposed to make the system scalable by limiting the search space to samples with high similarity scores in a lower-dimensional space. We conclude by presenting our solution to make dendrites secure against adversarial attacks. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper inspects changes in crime trends brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu, India. Using Bayesian structural time-series models, the authors study the changes in two metrics of criminal activity–crime registration and distress calls. In addition to absolute changes, the authors analyse the relative changes in one metric with respect to the other during two stay-at-home orders across six categories of crimes: property offences; offences against the human body; cases of missing persons and unidentified dead bodies; vehicle- and traffic-related offences; crimes against women, children and elders; and emerging crimes. While there was an overall decrease in most types of crime, results show that each category was impacted by restrictions in human mobility in different ways; emerging crimes, in particular, increased significantly during both periods. The crime and call trends exhibited a synchronous pattern with respect to a majority of offences except in the category of crimes against women and missing persons, where a contrary trend of decreasing crime registrations and increasing distress calls was noticed during the partial lockdown period. This finding highlights inherent inadequacies such as under-reporting of crimes by victims and non-registration of crime by the police. Understanding these inadequacies could potentially enhance preparedness leading to improved public service delivery by reordering priorities. Breaking down these trends at a crime-specific level assists law enforcement practitioners in gaining insights on crime motivators and enablers, thus contributing towards more effective crime prevention under ordinary circumstances. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Multi-purpose Messaging Mobile App (MMMA) combines several functionalities in a single APP to provide integrated service that brings tremendous convenience to users. Therefore, MMMAs become more and more popular. However, the prevalence of MMMAs also makes them a hotbed for cybercrime. Among them, “Click Farming” fraud requires special attention, as it causes substantial pecuniary losses and is challenging to detect. In this paper, we describe Multi-view Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (MHT-GNN), a framework for detecting “Click Farming” fraudsters in a popular MMMA called WeChat. We first adopt a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph (HTG) to model spatial, heterogeneous and temporal information contained in MM-MA data. We then extract two different types of user history sequences as two “views” of user behavior patterns from HTG. MHT-GNN contains a pretraining phase and a detection phase. The main components in MHT-GNN include Inductive Heterogeneous GNN Encoder, Temporal Snapshot Sequence Encoder, and User Relation Sequence Encoder. The first encoder aims to capture spatial information and the heterogeneity in each snapshot of HTG. The later two encoders are designed to incorporate temporal information to better reveal user’s behavior patterns and MHT-GNN leverages them to capture the two different views of user history behavior data. We conduct experiments on a real-world, million-scale dynamic graph extracted from WeChat. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MHT-GNN: it significantly exceeds existing detection methods, and it is able to block “Click Farming” fraud activities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The most interesting thing about occurrences of fraud is that they tend to have a pattern. Though nonsingular or linear, the patterns can be very divergent and have a wide leap of repetition. In recent decades, there's been a growing reliance on cloud and mobile computing, and though there's security, frauds tend to evolve with new patterns. Developing a fast-paced identifier of these patterns tends to help in detecting fraud beforehand with higher accuracy. The project is an analysis of how different algorithms and their combinations behave while detecting fraud. We used an Automobile insurance claim data-set operated under various algorithms like XG-Boost, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Bernoulli NB, Bagging Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Ada-Boost Classifier, Random Forest Algorithm, K Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression Algorithm. The model responds better with XG-Boost followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis. This could be paired up with the idea that gradient-based algorithms work faster and are more accurate and can be integrated with an improvised model sequencing the algorithms that predict fraud with minimum fallback.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Although repression against elites is a common occurrence in authoritarian regimes, we know little about which elites are targeted. This paper uses an original dataset on the prosecution of mayors in large Russian cities to examine the factors that make elites more likely to be arrested. We argue that in electoral authoritarian regimes like Russia, regime leaders are reluctant to arrest popular officials. Such officials command political capital that is useful to the regime, and arrests of prominent officials can produce popular backlash. We examine this argument using an original dataset on all arrests of municipal leaders in Russia’s 221 largest cities between 2002 and 2018. We find that mayors who won their elections by large margins are less likely to be arrested. In addition, we document several other substantively important patterns: (1) a mayor’s professional background is not related to the likelihood of arrest, (2) opposition mayors are four times more likely to be arrested, and (3) mobilization of votes for the regime is not protective against arrest.

AB  - The incidence of armed banditry has exacerbated the security conundrum in Nigeria to create a multidimensional security quandary. Meanwhile, the extant studies on the matter offer insubstantial theoretical explanations. This study attempts an extensive approach that captures the necessitating factors for banditry from an opportunistic standpoint. This is heralded on the presupposition that crime occurs as a result of the opportunities presented to carry it out. Therefore, this study adopts the theories of crime opportunities, such as routine activity theory, rational choice and crime pattern to expound on the incidence of armed banditry in Nigeria. It was found out that opportunities play a role in banditry; the phenomenon is concentrated in time and space; the opportunities for the menace is highly specific and that the incidence produces opportunities for other crimes. Solutions rooted in the theoretical proposition of situational crime prevention and crime prevention through environmental design theories are thence proffered. © 2022 African Studies Association of India.

AB  - By definition, thefts are considered the act of taking away other people’s mobile possessions for personal use or for others, affecting crime rates, economic indicators and enabling recent studies to create risk zones in society, contributing to insurance pricing in actuarial methods. This paper analyzes the number of vehicle thefts of 38 locations near Campinas/S˜ao Paulo, Brazil, using a GLARMA(p,q) model with Poisson and Negative Binomial response. The main feature of GLARMA(p,q) is to consider the peculiarities of counting data as high dispersion. As a result, it was possible to verify the adequacy and usefulness of the model for counting data. With specific techniques for estimating time series related to the public security area, patterns can be better understood, revealing relevant information that can be added to decision-making processes to direct public policies © Università del Salento

AB  - Spatial characteristics of community resident's occupational structure is a classic topic in social geography studies. However, it is still an under-explored topic to examine the impact of community residents' occupational structure on the spatial pattern of different types of crimes. Taking a large city in South China as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of different types of occupational residents on the crimes of burglary, pickpocketing and assault by establishing spatial lag negative binomial regression models. Our study shows that different occupational groups have different social characteristics and socioeconomic status, and so do their different impacts on various criminal activities. The specific conclusions are as follows: 1) the person in charge of the unit has no significant influence on these three types of crimes; 2) professional skill workers have a significant positive impact on pickpocketing and assault; 3) clerks, business and service people and primary industry personnel have significant positive impacts on burglary; and 4) the distribution of personnel in the primary industry nearby will inhibit burglary, pickpocketing and assault. This study further explained the results in combination with the ‘costs, benefits and risks’ of rational choice theory. The conclusions may be of great reference value for community police strategies. © 2021

AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers’ crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers’ crime location choices, but not native robbers’. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Mobile advertising has undoubtedly become one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. The influx of capital attracts increasing fraudsters to defraud money from advertisers. Fraudsters can leverage many techniques, where bots install fraud is the most difficult to detect due to its ability to emulate normal users by implementing sophisticated behavioral patterns to evade from detection rules defined by human experts. Therefore, we proposed BotSpot1 for bots install fraud detection previously. However, there are some drawbacks in BotSpot, such as the sparsity of the devices' neighbors, weak interactive information of leaf nodes, and noisy labels. In this work, we propose BotSpot++ to improve these drawbacks: (1) for the sparsity of the devices' neighbors, we propose to construct a super device node to enrich the graph structure and information flow utilizing domain knowledge and a clustering algorithm; (2) for the weak interactive information, we propose to incorporate a self-Attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of various leaf nodes; and (3) for the noisy labels, we apply a label smoothing mechanism to alleviate it. Comprehensive experimental results show that BotSpot++ yields the best performance compared with six state-of-The-Art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy our model to the advertising platform of Mobvista,2 a leading global mobile advertising company. The online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - This paper shows that racial composition shocks during the Great Migration (1940–1970) reduced the gains from growing up in the northern United States for Black families and can explain 27 percent of the region’s racial upward mobility gap today. I identify northern Black share increases by interacting pre-1940 Black migrants’ location choices with predicted southern county out-migration. Locational changes, not negative selection of families, explain lower upward mobility, with persistent segregation and increased crime and policing as plausible mechanisms. The case of the Great Migration provides a more nuanced view of moving to opportunity when destination reactions are taken into account. © 2022 American Economic Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. Today, in Ukraine there is no centralized scalable system for collecting and processing video data, which would allow controlling the roadway and roadside environment. Problem Statement. Video surveillance systems, as a rule, use stationary cameras. Since there are many cameras employed in this kind of systems, there are problems related to transferring information (creating and maintaining a data network) and processing (creating datacenters for processing and storing received data). Purpose. The purpose of this research is to create a video collection system for control of a roadway and roadside environment, as well as an environment into the municipal transport to help detect crimes committed in the surveillance zones. Material and Methods. In this research, there has been used a smartphone and a camera for testing the functions and algorithms of our proposed system. To reduce the size of data to be processed, we have used the methods for the selective perception of video information, the detection of moving objects, the parallel and conveyor processing of video information to accelerate its processing, as well as the methods and means of rapid release of informative patterns for searching and recognizing objects. Results. The concept and structure of the hardware and software of the mobile video surveillance system have been developed, the system has been protected by the patent of Ukraine for a utility model; a new type camera for shooting and analyzing video data has been designed and created (in cooperation with a partner); the software components of the system for the automatic detection of license plates and their recognition and the automatic detection of people without a masks inside a public transport for the further data analysis have been developed. Conclusions. Using mobile systems of this type allows expanding video surveillance zone in cities and outsides and reducing costs of road video surveillance systems. © 2022 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

AB  - The development of advanced Information Technology by greatly improving human thought patterns. This home security problem can be overcome with a security system that can be delivered to homeowners via SMS notification (Short Message Service) compilation of plow sensors accepting people who enter the compilation house when it is installed and the system is in standby and the alarm will sound and the sound module has been designed to provide information about the movement in the house. To minimize this crime, the need for tools that can help improve home security. Based on the overall system test results in accordance with the desired that the security system can be used in a supported system, where when the PIR sensor supports movement the buzzer will sound, the red LED lights up, the sound module issues the expected voice message and the GSM module will send a message to the homeowner's mobile number. PIR sensor will work optimally if the object is detected by humans with a maximum distance of 6 meters. While for animals (cats), the success is only 40%, and plants cannot be detected at all by the PIR sensor and the GSM module will send a verification message to the cellphone owner in less than 1 minute. This tool is more effectively used in a room that provides valuable items, for example in a room or other room. © 2021, Intellectual Research and Development Education Foundation (YRPI).

AB  - There is limited availability of mobile money transaction datasets from Sub-Saharan Africa for research because transaction data records are sensitive in nature and therefore raise privacy concerns. This has in turn hindered the potential to study fraudulent patterns in mobile money transactions so as to propose realistic mitigation measures based on Machine Learning Approaches to the prevailing financial fraud challenges in the region. This research presents mobile money scenarios that should be considered in order to implement a simulator that can harness synthetic datasets for mobile money transactions from Sub-Saharan Africa so as to carry out fraud detection research. These scenarios include the definition of a mobile money ecosystem with processes used by actors such as mobile money agents, clients, merchants and banks to interact with each other in mobile money operations. There is also a need for a real mobile money dataset to extract statistical information and diverse fraudulent behaviours of actors and fraud examples in mobile money markets. This research uses the design considerations to examine process-driven techniques such as numerical simulation, agent-based modeling, and data-driven techniques such as neural networks that can be leveraged to generate synthetic datasets for mobile money transactions. Common data generation toolkits like PaySim, AMLSim, RetSim and ABIDES that are based on these techniques have been examined. The design considerations are used to design a realistic model known as MoMTSim based on real mobile money processes and agent-based modeling techniques that can be implemented to generate synthetic transaction datasets for mobile money with fraud instances. This will facilitate fraud detection research. The synthetic datasets eliminate data privacy risks, are easy and faster to obtain, and are cheap to experiment with. With the proposed model, different research groups can move to the implementation stage to realise a model for synthetic data generation for mobile money transactions from the Sub-Saharan region.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Objectives: Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods: We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results: The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion: Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Crime location choice has been a central theme of crime geography research. However, the current research reveals little about the spatial differences among different age groups of criminals when they choose crime locations. Using kernel density estimation and discrete spatial choice models in ZG City, China, this study aims to explore the spatial variation in crime location choices of street robbers at different ages. We also examine the different influences of activity nodes, supervision role, and social disorganization on crime location choice. The results demonstrate that there are significant spatial differences in crime location choices by street robbers at different ages. Juvenile robbers tend to commit crimes in labor-intensive industrial clusters and primary and secondary school areas, young adult robbers tend to commit crimes only in labor-intensive industrial clusters, and adult robbers prefer urban areas with transportation hubs. Additionally, this study demonstrates that age-related activity nodes, the supervision role of the ambient population, and the proportion of youngsters are the main factors for such spatial differences. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Cybercafés have impact on crime location choices of juvenile and young adult robbers, while transportation hubs affect those of young adult and adult robbers, and bars and schools influence all the three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. (2) The supervision role exerted by the ambient population is greater for young adult and adult robbers compared with juvenile robbers. (3) Young adult robbers are more likely to target communities with more youngsters but juvenile and adult robbers are not. (4) Journey to crime has a significant negative effect on target choices, especially on juvenile robbers. In addition, these findings have great informative value for crime prevention and social governance. For example, (i) in labor-intensive industrial clusters where juvenile robbers frequently commit crimes, we can regulate the number of age-related activity nodes such as cybercafés and bars; (ii) in transportation hubs and their surrounding communities where adult robbers commit crimes intensively, we can encourage the persistence of the ambient population to persist and play a better supervision role; (iii) in communities predominated by youth population, we can survey delinquent juveniles to enhance the precise guidance and support. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - Spatio-temporal sequential pattern mining (STSPM) plays an important role in many applications such as mobile health, criminology, social media, solar events, transportation, etc. Most of the current studies assume the data is located in a centralized database on which a single machine performs mining. Thus, the existing centralized algorithms are not suitable for the big data environment, where data cannot be handled by a single machine. In this paper, our main aim is to find out the Spatio-temporal sequential patterns from the event data set using a distributed framework suitable for mining big data. We proposed two distributed algorithms, namely, MR-STBFM (MapReduce based spatio-temporal breadth first miner), and MR-SPTreeSTBFM (MapReduce based sequential pattern tree spatio-temporal breadth first miner). These are the distributed algorithms for mining spatio-temporal sequential patterns using Hadoop MapReduce framework. A spatio-temporal tree structure is used in MR-SPTreeSTBFM for reducing the candidate generation cost. This is an extension to the proposed MR-STBFM algorithm. The tree structure significantly improves the performance of the proposed approach. Also, the top-most significant pattern approach has been proposed to mine the top-most significant sequential patterns. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on the Boston crime dataset. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - While working with fingerprint images acquired from crime scenes, mobile cameras, or low-quality sensors, it becomes difficult for automated identification systems to verify the identity due to image blur and distortion. We propose a fingerprint deblurring model FDeblur-GAN, based on the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and multi-stage framework of the stack GAN. Additionally, we integrate two auxiliary sub-networks into the model for the deblurring task. The first sub-network is a ridge extractor model. It is added to generate ridge maps to ensure that fingerprint information and minutiae are preserved in the deblurring process and prevent the model from generating erroneous minutiae. The second sub-network is a verifier that helps the generator to preserve the ID information during the generation process. Using a database of blurred fingerprints and corresponding ridge maps, the deep network learns to deblur from the input blurry samples. We evaluate the proposed method in combination with two different fingerprint matching algorithms. We achieved an accuracy of 95.18% on our fingerprint database for the task of matching deblurred and ground truth fingerprints. &copy; 2021 IEEE. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Several changes in terrorist tactics have occurred recently. First, terrorist attack targets have changed from hard to soft targets. Second, terrorists are actively using low-tech terrorism methods that they can choose easily. Finally, terrorist attacks are evolving into complex and simultaneous terrorist events. This study endeavored to determine whether these changes affected the number of casualties from terrorist events that occurred in developed countries. Based on the rational choice theory and situational crime prevention, the variables were constructed based on two dimensions: “target factors in terrorism” and “terrorist attack factors in terrorism.” To achieve the purpose of this study, a negative binomial regression analysis was performed based on data from the Global Terrorism Database. Consequently, variables such as “exposure,” “protection capability,” “attack patterns (vehicle),” and “suicide terrorism” were verified for their statistically significant influence on “mass casualty terrorism (MCT).” This study suggests that it is necessary to design a preventive environment and arrange for personnel at each site that is vulnerable to terrorism to prevent MCT events from occurring inside facilities. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The daily rhythms of the city, the ebb and flow of people undertaking routines activities, inform the spatial and temporal patterning of crime. Being able to capture citizen mobility and delineate a crime-specific population denominator is a vital prerequisite of the endeavour to both explain and address crime. This paper introduces the concept of an exposed population-at-risk, defined as the mix of residents and non-residents who may play an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in a specific crime type, present in a spatial unit at a given time. This definition is deployed to determine the exposed population-at-risk for violent crime, associated with the night-time economy, in public spaces. Through integrating census data with mobile phone data and utilising fine-grained temporal and spatial violent crime data, the paper demonstrates the value of deploying an exposed (over an ambient) population-at-risk denominator to determine violent crime in public space hotspots on Saturday nights in Greater Manchester (UK). In doing so, the paper illuminates that as violent crime in public space rises, over the course of a Saturday evening, the exposed population-at-risk falls, implying a shifting propensity of the exposed population-at-risk to perform active roles as offenders, victims and/or guardians. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and policy relevance of these findings. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Along with gaining popularity of Real-Time Bidding (RTB) based programmatic advertising, the click farm based invalid traffic, which leverages massive real smartphones to carry out large-scale ad fraud campaigns, is becoming one of the major threats against online advertisement. In this study, we take an initial step towards the detection and large-scale measurement of the click farm based invalid traffic. Our study begins with a measurement on the device's features using a real-world labeled dataset, which reveals a series of features distinguishing the fraudulent devices from the benign ones. Based on these features, we develop EvilHunter, a system for detecting fraudulent devices through ad bid request logs with a focus on clustering fraudulent devices. EvilHunter functions by 1) building a classifier to distinguish fraudulent and benign devices; 2) clustering devices based on app usage patterns; and 3) relabeling devices in clusters through majority voting. EvilHunter demonstrates 97% precision and 95% recall on a real-world labeled dataset. By investigating a super click farm, we reveal several cheating strategies that are commonly adopted by fraudulent clusters. We further reduce the overhead of EvilHunter and discuss how to deploy the optimized EvilHunter in a real-world system. We are in partnership with a leading ad verification company to integrate EvilHunter into their industrial platform. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine small area variation in crime trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales. While we know how police-recorded crime responded to lockdown policies at the ‘macro’ level, less is known about the extent to which these trends were experienced uniformly at localized spatial scales. Methods: Longitudinal k-means clustering is used to unpick local area variation in police notifiable offences across England and Wales. We describe the clusters identified in terms of their spatial patterning, opportunity structures and crime type profile. Results: We find that in most small areas, crime remained fairly stable throughout the pandemic. Instead, a small number of meso-level areas contributed a disproportionately large amount to the macro-level trend. These were typically city centers with plentiful pre-pandemic crime opportunities, dominated by theft and shoplifting offences. Conclusion: Findings offer support for opportunity theories of crime and for a mobility theory of crime during the pandemic. We explore potential implications for policy, theory and further research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An Internet of Things (IoT) network is characterized by ad-hoc connectivity and varying traffic patterns where the routing topology evolves over time to account for mobility. In an IoT network, there can be an overwhelming number of massively connected devices, all of which must be able to communicate to each other with low latency to provide a positive user experience. Various protocols exist to allow for this connectivity, and are vulnerable to attack due to their simple nature. These attacks seek to disrupt or deny communications in the network by taking advantage of these vulnerabilities. These attacks include Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding and Scheduling attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to prevent these routing attacks exist, and have begun to incorporate Deep Learning (DL) to bring near perfect accuracy of detection of attackers. The DL approach opens up the IDS to the possibility of being the victim of an Adversarial Machine Learning attack. We explore the case of a novel evasion attack applied to a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) dataset for subversion of the IDS. Additionally, we explore possible mitigations for the proposed evasion attack, through adversarial example training, outlier detection, and a combination of the two. By using the combination, we are able to reduce the possible attack space by nearly two orders of magnitude. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Enforcing law and order has always been a challenge for law enforcement agencies. Exponential growth and unconditional access to Internet and mobile computing have added to this. It is in this context that police forces around the world are migrating to predictive policing. This move will aid them in informed decision-making leading to better enforcement of law and order. Using machine learning algorithms, law enforcement agencies can now extract specific patterns of crime and criminal behaviour from spatio-temporal data to determine whether a freshly committed crime relates to an existing pattern or not. With this knowledge, the administrators would be better equipped to map crime to criminals. Further, they can use the data for forecasting, which, in turn, will enable them to deploy resources judiciously. This can even aid in prevention of crimes or help efficient tackling of crimes. In this chapter, the authors investigate popular algorithms for finding patterns from large datasets and thus elucidating various machine learning approaches in crime analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Facial recognition is a fundamental method in facial-related science such as face detection, authentication, monitoring, and a crucial phase in computer vision and pattern recognition. Face recognition technology aids in crime prevention by storing the captured image in a database, which can then be used in various ways, including identifying a person. With just a few faces in the frame, most facial recognition systems function sufficiently when the techniques have been tested under artificial illumination, with accurate facial poses and non-blurry images. In our proposed system, a face recognition system is proposed using average pooling and MobileNetV2. The classifiers are implemented after a set of preprocessing steps on the retrieved image data. To compare the model is more effective, a performance test on the result is performed. It is observed from the study that MobileNetV2 triumphs over average pooling with an accuracy rate of 98.89% and 99.01% on training and test data, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The majority of geographical profiling research focuses on the relationship between offender and location, which works particularly well when a burial site is known. In real-world investigations, however, burial or dump sites are often not known. The aim of the current paper is to outline a relatively under-used method of geographic profiling: Winthropping. While the method has been around for several decades, few studies have provided any research findings using it. There are two likely reasons for Winthropping being under-used: first, it has not been clearly, theoretically explained; second, given its relative novelty, it may not be immediately clear how to use it in research and real-world scenarios. The current paper outlines several key psychological (e.g., satisficing and affordances) and criminological (e.g., rational choice theory and crime geometry) theories that may explain why Winthropping works. Case studies are provided, and a methodological approach (matrix forecasting) is then provided to show how it could work in research practice and real-world applications. Overall, Winthropping is deemed to be highly useful, and it is hoped that experts in the field will begin developing this tool for wider, applied use. © 2021, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.

AB  - Introduction: Road Traffic Accident (RTA), in this era of urbanization, have emerged as a global health hazard because of the morbidity and mortality associated with them. In an RTA, often the thoracic injuries go unnoticed and are overlooked because of the resilient nature of the thoracic wall, which leads to the late detection of injuries and their fatal outcomes. Aim of the study: To evaluate the pattern of thoracic injuries in RTA and to find out the epidemiological parameters involved in RTA. Materials and Methods: In this autopsy based cross-sectional study, 85 victims of fatal RTA were studied between 1st July 2019 to 31st December 2020 in the mortuary of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. All the fatal RTA cases coming for autopsy were included in the study except decomposed and mutilated cases. Result: In this study, male two-wheeler drivers, belonging to the age group 21-40 years were most vulnerable to RTAs. Maximum number of RTAs were reported during Winter season. Inter-city roads witnessed majority of the RTAs and two-wheelers were the most common offending agent. Most of the RTAs occurred during late evening i.e., 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Forty-three victims had chest injury after a RTA. Abrasion was the most common external chest injury followed by contusion. Fracture of thoracic skeleton was the major internal chest injury followed by chest wall contusion and injury to vital intrathoracic organ. 58 % of the victims, who had chest injury, had a fractured rib. 37 % of the RTA victims had collection in the pleural cavity either in the form of Hemothorax or Pneumothorax. Lung was the most common vital intrathoracic organ to be injured in RTA. Head injury was the most common cause of death followed by hemorrhage and shock. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of increasing road safety awareness, strictly enforcing traffic rules, establishing an advanced trauma response system, and providing well-equipped mobile ambulatory service to reduce the morbidity and mortality resulting from road traffic accidents. © 2022, Institute of Medico-legal Publication.

AB  - Federated network platforms over the 5G and be-yond networks will extend novel opportunities to provide end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) services. Using a logically centralized software-defined controller (i.e., SDN) is more practical than conventional distributed and ad hoc management to support efficient, scalable management and orchestration. However, the security issues of IoT services over the federated platforms using SDN are not well explored. A distributed wormhole attack over the federated IoT system is one of the most challenging security issues, where a group of secret attackers can easily exploit the centralized controllers with various wireless control messages. This paper presents an ML-Defense (Machine Learning for building a Dependable Federated Network System) against various intelligent wormhole attacks. Using an unsupervised learning algorithm, ML-Defense identifies different wormhole attacker patterns and locations. Our simulation results indicate that ML-Defense can cluster the attackers' location without requiring special devices and pinpoints the core of the attackers by examining the suspicious area.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Explaining how offenders choose a crime location is one of the central themes of crime geography. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice mostly considers the impact of the built environment and social environment, without considering the impact of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery and its temporal difference. To fill this gap, this study integrated ambient population and surveillance cameras in assessing street robbers' decision making and its time effects in ZG City of China, by using the discrete spatial choice modeling. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant negative impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a protective role in preventing street robbers' criminal activities. Interestingly, we found that the protective effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. The protective role of ambient population and surveillance cameras is stable daily through the week, but diurnally, the influence of ambient population shows temporal fluctuation, while the impact of surveillance cameras is temporally stable. These findings can be of some reference for police control and crime geography research by: 1) Carrying out the experimental evaluation of surveillance camera system's prevention and control effect, and dynamic optimization and adjustment of surveillance cameralocations. 2) Arranging a suitable amount of mixed functional land in urban planning or urban renewal to strengthen the moderation of ambient population through planning or management. 3) Focusing on diurnal variability in future studies of the time effects. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment involving subway station closures to examine how subway ridership is associated with the impact of robbery victimization within spatial network buffers immediately surrounding subway stations in Bronx (County), New York. The New York City subway system is the busiest in the USA, with an annual ridership estimated at 1.8 billion people. Key findings of this research include noteworthy relationships between robbery hot spots and subway stations, as well as substantial reductions in robbery frequency during temporary subway station closures, with larger reductions occurring in closer proximities to the subway stations. There was also a significant robbery pattern “normalization process” that occurred after the closed subway stations were reopened where robbery frequency returned to historically “normal” pre-closure levels. These notable decreases of crime in and around subway stations during the station closure time periods, as well as the prominent increases in robbery when subway stations reopened, should be taken into consideration when planning transit maintenance, conducting crime prevention initiatives, and scheduling crime control strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Face recognition plays a significant research attention in the recent years on computer vision with emerging security needs in automated video surveillance. Face recognition is plays major role in day-to-day life such as accessing mobile phone through face identification, crime investigation, and victim identification in the crowded area. Due to need in security increases derivative pattern based approach improve the recognition accuracy which leads to the LTrP with four directions. In this work, we propose local tetra pattern (LTrPs) based derivative approach for representing descriptive patterns of facial images. Local Binary Patterns (LBPs), Local Derivative Patterns (LDPs) and, Local Ternary Patterns (LTPs) which encoding association between the neighboring pixels, and referenced pixel values by generating gray level pixel value difference. Proposed approach encode association between pixel, and referenced pixel value. Neighboring pixel value directions are computed through first order derivative of horizontal directions. Nth-order tetra pattern is computed through (n − 1)th-order vertical, and horizontal derivatives for accurate facial image analysis through Gabor transform. To estimate the proposed system performance experiment conducted with JAFFE and ORL dataset. As a result, LTrP achieves the better recognition accuracy among the other patterns such as LBP, LTP and LDP. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Mobility among sex workers has been linked not only to improved economic and social opportunities, but also to concerns regarding displacement, criminalization, and violence. In 2014, new “end-demand” legislation criminalized new aspects of sex work in Canada (e.g., third-party advertising, purchasing) while leaving the sale of sex legal. Utilizing data from a longitudinal community-based cohort of women sex workers in Metro Vancouver (An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access [AESHA], 2010-2016), we used kernel density mapping to understand and identify geographic patterns of workplace neighborhood mobility (i.e., changing the primary neighborhood in which one worked in the last 6 months); multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was also used to model contextual (policing, violence, and safety) and individual correlates of workplace mobility among sex workers over the 6-year period, including potential changes in mobility patterns pre- and post-end-demand criminalization. A total of 543 sex workers were included in analyses, contributing 2,199 observations. A total of 402 (74.0%) experienced workplace neighborhood mobility during the study period. Neighborhood mobility was negatively correlated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98/year older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.97, 0.99]) and positively correlated with homelessness (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = [1.12, 1.82]), identifying as a gender/sexual minority (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.70]), and servicing clients primarily outdoors (vs. informal indoor or in-call venues; AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = [1.21, 1.81]); police harassment (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI = [0.96, 1.48], p =.11) and changing one’s neighborhood of work due to safety concerns (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = [0.94, 2.00], p =.09) were both marginally correlated. Steps to promote safer working conditions for marginalized women in urban environments remain urgently needed, including shifts away from criminalized enforcement toward community-led initiatives and promoting access to safer indoor workspaces. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Space and time are two dimensions of importance in modeling data for mobility analysis, and in many realms of studies, space and time are vital in recognizing various mobility patterns for analyzing massive data. Data featuring both the dimensions of space and time is called spatiotemporal data. Spatiotemporal data have been recorded in studies such as climate science, neuroscience, social sciences, mobile health, epidemiology, transportation, criminology, and earth science (Liu and Qu 2016; Atluri et al. 2017), to generate useful information. In fact, these fields experience a rapid transformation with the proliferation of vast amount of available spatiotemporal data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, corrected publication 2022.

AB  - Iris recognition of living individuals is a mature biometric modality that has been adopted globally from governmental ID programs, border crossing, voter registration and de-duplication, to unlocking mobile phones. On the other hand, the possibility of recognizing deceased subjects with their iris patterns has emerged recently. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning-based method for postmortem iris segmentation and recognition with a special visualization technique intended to support forensic human examiners in their efforts. The proposed postmortem iris segmentation approach outperforms the state of the art and - in addition to iris annulus, as in case of classical iris segmentation methods - detects abnormal regions caused by eye decomposition processes, such as furrows or irregular specular highlights present on the drying and wrinkling cornea. The method was trained and validated with data acquired from 171 cadavers, kept in mortuary conditions, and tested on subject-disjoint data acquired from 259 deceased subjects. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of data used in postmortem iris recognition research to date. The source code of the proposed method are offered with the paper. The test data will be available through the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) archives.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Mobile PR is an important component of the mobile app ecosystem. A major threat to this ecosystem's long-term health is click fraud, which involves clicking on ads while infected with malware or using an automated bot to do it for you. The methods used to identify click fraud now focus on looking at server requests. Although these methods have the potential to produce huge numbers of false negatives, they may easily be avoided if clicks are hidden behind proxies or distributed globally. AdSherlock is a customer-side (inside the app) efficient and deployable click fraud detection system for mobile applications that we provide in this work. AdSherlock separates the computationally expensive click request identification procedures into an offline and online approach. AdSherlock uses URL (Uniform Resource Locator) tokenization in the Offline phase to create accurate and probabilistic patterns. These models are used to identify click requests online, and an ad request tree model is used to detect click fraud after that. In order to develop and evaluate the AdSherlock prototype, we utilise actual applications. It injects the online detector directly into an executable software package using binary instrumentation technology (BIT). The findings show that AdSherlock outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for detecting click fraud with little false positives. Advertisement requests identification, mobile advertising fraud detection are some of the keywords used in this article. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent literature indicates the destruction of human remains using hydrochloric acid (HCl, 38%) is often attempted to obscure the identity of victims or as a disposal method. Dentition are informative in an investigation where acid is used as a means of body disposal, as teeth are more likely to survive intact. Importantly, researchers studying acid immersion have not observed immature dentition, nor have they analyzed immature acid-treated teeth using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This study analyzes the effects of HCl on immature human molars, with two goals: understanding the timing and nature of physical changes to immature molars caused by HCl immersion, and aiding in the identification and age determination of dental tissues partially or nearly completely destroyed using HCl. Our results indicated that immature human molars immersed in HCl follow a pattern of physical changes and decrease in weight as they dissolve similar to mature molars, although the timing of dissolution is affected by their smaller size and incompletely developed roots in a predictable way. With less root material present and an open root tip, we observed that HCl can more quickly penetrate the pulp cavity of immature molars. The mobile SEM images indicated immature and mature molars immersed in HCl exhibit similar changes at the microscopic level. Immature molars treated with HCl for over 18 h exhibited cracking features similar to those visible on mature molars that were difficult to differentiate from similar features on untreated teeth (both mature and immature) when images were taken at 3,000x or less. The appearance of features such as peeling layers and lamination at high magnification (6000x) were visible on both acid-treated mature and immature molars, but were not visible on untreated molars at the same level of magnification. By observing changes in the enamel and pulp cavity, it was possible to determine whether third molars were immature until approximately 18 h immersed in acid. At 42 h, it was no longer possible to determine whether the molars were immature. However, they were still easily identifiable as human teeth. In situations where teeth may no longer be identifiable macroscopically, we found that the laminating and peeling features observed on high magnification SEM imagery can be useful in characterizing acid treatment even on very small fragments of dental remains, potentially allowing investigators to determine if acid was used as a disposal method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine

AB  - Phishing scams via SMS have become a common phenomenon due to the widespread use of smartphones and the availability of mobile Internet technologies. Identifying a phishing SMS via analyzing unstructured short texts is a challenging issue in the domain of AI-driven cybersecurity. Machine learning-based techniques integrated with natural language processing have massive potentials to identify differentiating patterns between phishing and legitimate SMS. In this paper, we have experimented with several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms on a benchmark dataset. Also, NLP-based feature extraction and feature selection steps are incorporated to build an automated phishing detection strategy. Support vector machine classifier when applied after feature extraction and feature selection has outperformed the tenfold cross-validation score of 98.27%, F1-score of 99.08% for legitimate SMS, and accuracy of 98.39%. The performance of the tested methods has been evaluated through popular evaluation metrics on a benchmark dataset. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Small cell, mmWave, and massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) technologies in 5G cellular networks becomes inevitable trend caused by killer applications such as holographic video which is traffic-intensive. In this paper, we study a sequential activation beam selection, user scheduling, and power allocation problem in a mmWave network with massive MIMO utilizing a physical layer preceding technique. We aim to maximize the time-Averaged utility of users with a time-Averaged transmit power constraint on top of the EdgeSON architecture, which takes advantage of both centralized and distributed characteristics. We decompose the original long-Term problem into two-Time scales in which solving the problem of choosing beam pattern is run at a slower time scale than solving user scheduling and power allocation. Then, to solve user scheduling and power allocation, we leverage the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework which transforms an original long-Term average problem into per-slot modified sub-problems. Since provided per-slot problem to find a set of user scheduling and power allocation is known as NP-hard, we propose a low-complex and practical interference management algorithm, namely CRIM, by introducing two critical users with the highest interference channel gain in intra-BS and inter-BS respectively. Finally, via extensive simulations, we verify and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm and comparing algorithms in a real mmWave network environment. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The increased use of secure social media apps on smartphones has attracted the interest of criminals looking to engage in illegal activities. The additional user confidentiality requirements, as well as the security features of these applications, complicate forensic investigations. The extensive analysis of encrypted traffic sessions, on the other hand, has the potential of identifying involved parties and their activities. In this paper, we conduct a network traffic analysis of Twitter, a popular social media application that uses encryption to protect information transmitted over the network. We concentrate on the Android platform to generate Twitter traffic, analyze fixed patterns, and extract artifacts based on various user actions. A firewall is also used to investigate Twitter's hidden design flexibilities and alternate connectivity options. Through our analysis, we were able to correctly identify the flow of Twitter traffic, user-related information, and fixed patterns to classify different user activities on Twitter.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background: In a cluster-randomised trial (CRT) of combination HIV prevention (HPTN 071 (PopART)) in 12 Zambian communities and nine South African communities, carried out from 2012 to 2018, the intervention arm A that offered HIV treatment irrespective of CD4 count did not have a significant impact on population level HIV incidence. Intervention arm B, where HIV incidence was reduced by 30%, followed national guidelines that mid trial (2016) changed from starting HIV treatment according to a CD4 threshold of 500 to universal treatment. Using social science data on the 21 communities, we consider how place (community context) might have influenced the primary outcome result. Methods: A social science component documented longitudinally the context of trial communities. Data were collected through rapid qualitative assessment, interviews, group discussions and observations. There were a total of 1547 participants and 1127 observations. Using these data, literature and a series of qualitative analysis steps, we identified key community characteristics of relevance to HIV and triangulated these with HIV community level incidence. Results: Two interdependent social factors were relevant to communities’ capability to manage HIV: stability/instability and responsiveness/resistance. Key components of stability were social cohesion; limited social change; a vibrant local economy; better health, education and recreational services; strong institutional presence; established middle-class residents; predictable mobility; and less poverty and crime. Key components of responsiveness were community leadership being open to change, stronger history of HIV initiatives, willingness to take up HIV services, less HIV-related stigma and a supported and enterprising youth population. There was a clear pattern of social factors across arms. Intervention arm A communities were notably more resistant and unstable. Intervention arm B communities were overall more responsive and stable. Conclusions: In the specific case of the dissonant primary outcome results from the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, the chance allocation of less stable, less responsive communities to arm A compared to arm B may explain some of the apparently smaller impact of the intervention in arm A. Stability and responsiveness appear to be two key social factors that may be relevant to secular trends in HIV incidence. We advocate for a systematic approach, using these factors as a framework, to community context in CRTs and monitoring HIV prevention efforts. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01900977.

AB  - Although the use of pay-per-click mechanisms stimulates the prosperity of the mobile advertisement network, fraudulent ad clicks result in huge financial losses for advertisers. Extensive studies identify click fraud according to click/traffic patterns based on dynamic analysis. However, in this study, we identify a novel click fraud, named humanoid attack, which can circumvent existing detection schemes by generating fraudulent clicks with similar patterns to normal clicks. We implement the first tool ClickScanner to detect humanoid attacks on Android apps based on static analysis and variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) with limited knowledge of fraudulent examples. We define novel features to characterize the patterns of humanoid attacks in the apps' bytecode level. ClickScanner builds a data dependency graph (DDG) based on static analysis to extract these key features and form a feature vector. We then propose a classification model only trained on benign datasets to overcome the limited knowledge of humanoid attacks. We leverage ClickScanner to conduct the first large-scale measurement on app markets (i.e., 120,000 apps from Google Play and Huawei AppGallery) and reveal several unprecedented phenomena. First, even for the top-rated 20,000 apps, ClickScanner still identifies 157 apps as fraudulent, which shows the prevalence of humanoid attacks. Second, it is observed that the ad SDK-based attack (i.e., the fraudulent codes are in the third-party ad SDKs) is now a dominant attack approach. Third, the manner of attack is notably different across apps of various categories and popularities. Finally, we notice there are several existing variants of the humanoid attack. Additionally, our measurements demonstrate the proposed ClickScanner is accurate and time-efficient (i.e., the detection overhead is only 15.35% of those of existing schemes). © 2021 ACM.

AB  - People ebb and flow across the city. The spatial and temporal patterning of crime is, in part, reflective of this mobility, of the scale of the population present in any given setting at a particular time. It is also a function of capacity of this population to perform an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in any specific crime type, itself shaped by the time-variant activities undertaken in, and the qualities of, particular settings. To this end, this paper explores the intra-daily influence of activities and settings upon the weekday spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public spaces. This task is achieved through integrating a transient population dataset with travel survey, point-of-interest and recorded crime data in a study of Great Manchester (UK). The research deploys a negative binomial regression model controlling for spatial lag effects. It finds strong and independent, but time-variant, associations between leisure activities, leisure settings and the spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public space. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Mobile devices are increasingly involved in crimes. Therefore, digital evidence on mobile devices plays a more and more important role in crime investigations. Existing studies have designed tools to identify and/or extract digital evidence in the main memory or the file system of a mobile device. However, identifying and extracting digital evidence from the logging system of a mobile device is largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap.Specifically, we design, prototype, and evaluate LogExtractor, the first tool to automatically identify and extract digital evidence from log messages on an Android device. Given a log message, LogExtractor first determines whether the log message contains a given type of evidentiary data (e.g., GPS coordinates) and then further extracts the value of the evidentiary data if the log message contains it. Specifically, LogExtractor takes an offline-online approach. In the offline phase, LogExtractor builds an App Log Evidence Database (ALED) for a large number of apps via combining string and taint analysis to analyze the apps' code. Specifically, each record in the ALED contains 1) the string pattern of a log message that an app may write to the logging system, 2) the types of evidentiary data that the log message includes, and 3) the segment(s) of the string pattern that contains the value of a certain type of evidentiary data, where we represent a string pattern using a deterministic finite-state automaton. In the online phase, given a log message from a suspect's Android device, we match the log message against the string patterns in the ALED and extract evidentiary data from it if the matching succeeds. We evaluate LogExtractor on 65 benchmark apps from DroidBench and 12.1 K real-world apps. Our results show that a large number of apps write a diverse set of data to the logging system and LogExtractor can accurately extract them. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - More than half a million people in the U.S. experience homelessness every day. Lacking other options, many turn to transit vehicles, stops, and stations for shelter. Many also ride public transit to reach various destinations. With affordable housing scarce and the numbers of unhoused individuals often surpassing the capacities of existing safety nets and support systems, transit operators face homelessness as a pressing issue on their systems and must implement policy measures from other realms beyond transportation to address it. Because of the health and safety implications for transit of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated further rise in homelessness from the resulting economic downturn, studying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable travelers is critical. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify articles discussing homelessness in transit systems. While only a handful of articles exist from the 1990s, there is an emerging literature in the last 20 years that examines different aspects of homelessness in transit systems. We identify and review 63 articles on homelessness in transit systems and other public settings to better understand the extent of homelessness in the U.S., and how transit agencies perceive its impacts. We also summarise literature findings on the travel patterns of unsheltered individuals, which show that public transit represents an important and common mode of travel for them. Lastly, we focus on responses to homelessness from the part of transit operators. We find two types of responses: 1) punitive, in which criminalisation, policing and enforcement of laws and codes of conduct prevail, and 2) outreach-related, which aim towards providing help and support to unsheltered individuals. We conclude by summarising our findings as well as the existing gaps in the literature. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cloud storage has grown in popularity, attracting a lot of interest from academics and IT professionals. In the digital era, cloud computing has grown increasingly vital for scalable resource sharing, smooth computing, and information interchange. Researchers have a challenging task in securing cloud data, resources, applications, and infrastructure. Cloud security methods are used to protect the cloud in the cloud computing environment. Detective controls, for example, are critical in cloud security because they discover possible breaches and defend the cloud environment from attacks. This detective control mechanism is built using an intrusion detection system (IDS). The network traffic data utilised to build the IDS using a machine-learning algorithm has a major influence on the detection accuracy of the IDS. When the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to that of existing algorithms, it is observed that the new approach outperforms the others. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have become an important security tool for monitoring and researching network security in mobile cloud computing (MCC). However, several modern techniques still have flaws, such as high false positive rates, poor classification accuracies, and low true positive rates. This paper provides an intrusion detection strategy for MCC based on support vector machines (SVM) and information gain (IG). The suggested approach employs the SVM classifier to categories network data into normal and attack behaviours, and IG to choose the significant features and reduce the unnecessary features, because to the irrelevant and duplicated characteristics seen in KDD datasets. Because it can be accessible from anywhere on the internet, cloud storage has become the most popular data and information storage option. While it has its own set of advantages and benefits, its storage system protection has certain drawbacks. Cloud encryption ensures that cloud storage is secure, but it does not guarantee that the system will not be hacked. Cloud storage, like any other untrustworthy setting, demands the ability to safeguard shared data. This suggested solution gives access control to data handled in the cloud without contacting the vendor.  © 2022 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to detect the workplace crime of organizational sales representatives (e.g., sales who work with external customers) through abnormal activities that can be traced by mobile devices and applications. The guardianship capability of organizations is considered as the moderator influencing the monitoring of abnormal usage activities calculated by deep learning. In this study, we conduct event history analysis on the occurrence of workplace crime utilizing a longitudinal panel data set, which comprises 197179 weekly observations in 3 years (2017-2019). Our finding provides evidence that the abnormal activity pattern is an effective signal for identifying workplace crimes. Furthermore, we illustrate how to design monitoring modes based on guardianship capability in order to maximize the effectiveness of mobile monitoring in reducing workplace crimes. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - COVID-19 impacts the daily lives of millions of people. This radical change in our daily activities affected many aspects of life, but acted as well as a natural experiment for research into the spatial distribution of 911 calls. We analyse the impact of the COVID-19 measures on the spatial pattern of police interventions. Crime is not uniformly distributed across street segments, but how does COVID-19 affect these spatial patterns? To this end, Gini coefficients are calculated and a proportion differences spatial point pattern test is applied to compare the similarity of the patterns of incidents before, during, and after the first lockdown in Antwerp, Belgium. With only essential mobility being allowed, the emergency call pattern has not significantly changed before, during or after this lockdown, however, a qualitative shift in police officer’s daily work may have had an effect on the daily operation of the Antwerp police force. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Internal migration of the urban population is substantial with diverse drivers, barriers, and reasons for destination choices. Whereas internal mobility in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries is well-studied under the umbrella of residential, labour, amenity, and retirement migration, such research in non-OECD countries is rare and limited to the economic aspects of migration. In this study, we assess the relative importance of social, environmental, and amenity factors in urban peoples' destination choices within three countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) through an online survey. Concerns about safety and high living costs at potential destinations were among the most important factors in mobility decisions, whereas amenities were the least important. A high risk from climatic hazards, particularly from severe ones such as flooding and typhoons, was also an influential destination disincentive, particularly for people in Malaysia and the Philippines, that is, likely to grow in importance as climate change accelerates unabated. To maintain the attractiveness of highly exposed cities and regions to skilled people, urban planners must minimise these risks, for example, through crime control, flood disaster management, and early warning systems. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This article examines the success of religious social capital and the agency of teungku dayah (Islamic scholars who belong to traditional religious school) in the collective drug eradication movement in Ujong Pacu, Lhokseumawe-Aceh, Indonesia. The role of religious social capital in combating the drugs market in global drug policy has been less studied. This study provides a quite different view from most scholars who work for combating drug dealers by engaging participation of religious communities in rural society. The agency of teungku dayah succeeded in mobilizing the villagers due to the social capital that bonded the community based on religious ties. The article used live-in method, observation, in-depth and interviews to build a sociological imagination about the patterns of social practice of the people who become the subject of the research. The researchers lived in one of the villager's houses, participated in their discussions, listened to the gossip, worshipped with them and were involved in certain jobs carried out by the community members who targeted informants. Using religious social capital, this article argues that teungku dayah effectively used the social and religious capital of the Ujong Pacu community to conduct drug eradication. Religious social capital has strong ties in unifying elements of the people in the same religion, moreover it becomes an energy that keeps motivating the community to run anti-drugs movement and driving out the drug addicts in Ujong Pacu, Lhokseumawe-Aceh. © RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY 2020.

AB  - Tumor metastases represent the major cause of cancer-related mortality, confirming the urgent need to identify key molecular pathways and cell-associated networks during the early phases of the metastatic process to develop new strategies to either prevent or control distal cancer spread. Several data revealed the ability of cancer cells to establish a favorable microenvironment, before their arrival in distant organs, by manipulating the cell composition and function of the new host tissue where cancer cells can survive and outgrow. This predetermined environment is termed “pre-metastatic niche” (pMN). pMN development requires that tumor-derived soluble factors, like cytokines, growth-factors and extracellular vesicles, genetically and epigenetically re-program not only resident cells (i.e., fibroblasts) but also non-resident cells such as bone marrow-derived cells. Indeed, by promoting an “emergency” myelopoiesis, cancer cells switch the steady state production of blood cells toward the generation of pro-tumor circulating myeloid cells defined as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) able to sustain tumor growth and dissemination. MDSCs are a heterogeneous subset of myeloid cells with immunosuppressive properties that sustain metastatic process. In this review, we discuss current understandings of how MDSCs shape and promote metastatic dissemination acting in each fundamental steps of cancer progression from primary tumor to metastatic disease. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Canè, Petrova, Sartoris, Ugel and De Sanctis.

AB  - This paper discusses the impact of immigration policies on the ways young undocumented Sikh migrants in Paris negotiate their masculinity. The current criminalization of labor migration from the global South in Europe is disrupting long established patterns of upward mobility through international migration, that entailed remitting money home, getting married and reuniting with one’s family in the host country and moving up the socio-professional ladder from low-paid jobs to self employment. Instead, the life of an increasing number of Sikh migrants in France and elsewhere is marked by irregular status and socio-economic vulnerability. In this context, undocumented Sikh migrants try to assert their gender identity in multiple ways, characterized by homosociality, the importance of manual labor, specific forms of male sociability marked by the cultivation of their body, while remaining firmly grounded in a Sikh/Panjabi religious universe through seva (voluntary service) and gurdwara attendance. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Nowadays, 23% of the world population lives in multi-million cities. In these metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Seminal studies analyse crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large in a single city. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how violent and property crimes are related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods. To that end, we analyse crime at small areas and integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces to compare how the different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogotá, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another. Thus there is clearly no “one fits all” model. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the most effective treatment option for hemifacial spasm (HFS). However, deeply located forms of compression would require proper identification to allow for adequate decompression. OBJECTIVE: To describe the usefulness of endoscopic visualization in one of the most challenging compression patterns in HFS, where the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) loop is severely indenting the brain stem at the proximal root exit zone of facial nerve along the pontomedullary sulcus. METHODS: Radiological and operative data were checked for all patients in whom severe indentation of the brainstem by PICA at pontomedullary sulcus was recorded and endoscope-assisted MVD was performed. Clinical correlation and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients with HFS were identified with radiological and surgical evidence proving brainstem indentation at the VII transitional zone. In 31 patients, PICA was the offending vessel to the facial nerve. In 3 patients, the PICA loop was mobilized under visualization of a 45◦ endoscope. A total of 31 patients had a mean follow-up duration of 52.1 mo. The mean duration between start of complaints and surgery was 7.2 yr. In the last follow-up, all patients had remarkable spasm improvement. A total of 5 patients had more than 90% disappearance of spasms and 26 patients experienced spasm-free outcome. CONCLUSION: Although severe indentation of brain stem implies morphological damage, outcome after MVD is excellent. A 45◦ endoscope is extremely helpful to identify compression down at the pontomedullary sulcus. Deeply located compression site can easily be missed with microscopic inspection alone. © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021

AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders’ previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders’ knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location’s crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Mobile Ad hoc networks (MANET) are becoming extremely popular because of the expedient features that also make them more exposed to various kinds of security attacks. The Wormhole attack is considered to be the most unsafe attack due to its unusual pattern of tunnel creation between two malevolent nodes. In it, one malevolent node attracts all the traffic towards the tunnel and forwards it to another malevolent node at the other end of the tunnel and replays them again in the network. Once the Wormhole tunnel is created it can launch different kind of other attacks such as routing attack, packet dropping, spoofing etc. In past few years a lot of research is done for securing routing protocols. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is considered foremost MANET routing protocols. In this paper we are forming the wormhole tunnel in which malevolent nodes use different interfaces for communication in DSR protocol. NS3 simulator is being used for the analysis of the DSR routing protocol under the wormhole attack. This paper provides better understanding of the wormhole attack in DSR protocol which can benefit further research. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In the present computer networking scenario, due to increase in the amount of ubiquitous network usage with computers, mobile computing, sensing systems and IoT applications, there is a tendency for large-scale cyber-attacks to occur. With the enormous rise in cyber-attacks in today's world, it becomes imperative to monitor the network packet flow in order to identify attacks by intruders, which otherwise can lead to disruptions and losses in computing resources. These large dimensional and voluminous network packets have to be carefully examined and investigated for network anomalies, and will be a tedious and complicated task. Hence, to make this process simpler, a network anomaly detection model that considers the temporal variations in packet transmissions to identify the threats and to protect these networks against malicious activities is proposed. In this model, we propose a machine learning based anomaly detection system (ADS) that is capable of classifying malicious and benign traffic. At the same time, identifies the time varying patterns by using unsupervised learning that provides the patterns and hidden features in the captured packets. Kohonen's self-organizing map neural network (KSOM-NN) is used as an unsupervised learning method to classify the pre-processed packet features into clusters and thereafter the classification methods are used and verified with the labelled dataset. Similarly, a statistical analysis and a threshold value of packet loss, jitter, and other parameters for normal and anomalous packets are observed for further investigations. Above models were trained and tested with the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Totally the patterns are thoroughly analyzed for anomalies with the help of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Improved performance with respect to anomaly detection rate and accuracy is observed. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal pattern of gunfire reports collected by the collaborative mobile app Fogo Cruzado in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area (Brazil). We apply nonparametric first and second-order inference tools to characterize gunfire behavior, and test whether gunfire patterns meet the assumptions of crime prediction models, such as kernel hotspot maps or self-exciting point process. The kernel intensity estimator describes the spatial distribution of gunfire and identifies chronic hotspots. The nonparametric test for comparison of first-order intensities found differences between gunfires with and without fatalities or police presence. The recently developed log-ratio based first-order separability test found that the spatial distribution of gunfire, fatalities and police presence varied over time. Finally, spatiotemporal inhomogeneous K-tests detected clustering between gunfire events, fatalities and police presence. These results suggest that a self-exciting point process with nonseparable background component is an acceptable model for future development of a suitable approach to forecast gunfire hotspots in Rio de Janeiro. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, along with the development of the urban public transport system, bus pickpocketing crimes have garnered increasing attention. In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The current study investigates body disposal patterns in sexual homicide and examines whether offender’s behavior differ between solved and unsolved cases. To address these two research questions in line with rational choice perspective, a series of logistic regression analyses was conducted on a sample of 250 solved, and 100 unsolved sexual homicide cases in Canada. Within solved cases, results show that if victim is a prostitute, body found concealed, and found lying face down, it is likely the body was moved. For unsolved cases, the role of victim as a prostitute, and body recovered outdoors suggest that the body was moved. Further, results indicate that post-crime phase factors predicted the most whether the victim’s body was moved in solved cases. Whereas within unsolved cases, crime-phase factors contributed the most at predicting whether the body was moved post-homicide. Theoretical and practical implications from this study are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Mobile advertising plays a vital role in the mobile app ecosystem. A major threat to the sustainability of this ecosystem is click fraud, i.e., ad clicks performed by malicious code or automatic bot problems. Existing click fraud detection approaches focus on analyzing the ad requests at the server side. However, such approaches may suffer from high false negatives since the detection can be easily circumvented, e.g., when the clicks are behind proxies or globally distributed. In this paper, we present AdSherlock, an efficient and deployable click fraud detection approach at the client side (inside the application) for mobile apps. AdSherlock splits the computation-intensive operations of click request identification into an offline procedure and an online procedure. In the offline procedure, AdSherlock generates both exact patterns and probabilistic patterns based on URL (Uniform Resource Locator) tokenization. These patterns are used in the online procedure for click request identification and further used for click fraud detection together with an ad request tree model. We implement a prototype of AdSherlock and evaluate its performance using real apps. The online detector is injected into the app executable archive through binary instrumentation. Results show that AdSherlock achieves higher click fraud detection accuracy compared with state of the art, with negligible runtime overhead.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Based on an offender spatial decision-making perspective, this burglary target location choice study aims to understand how physical and social barriers affect why residential burglars commit their crimes at particular locations in a major Chinese city. Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article develops and assesses the concept of triple neighborhood disadvantage. We argue that a neighborhood’s well-being depends not only on its own socioeconomic conditions but also on the conditions of neighborhoods its residents visit and are visited by, connections that form through networks of everyday urban mobility. We construct measures of mobility-based disadvantage using geocoded patterns of movement estimated from hundreds of millions of tweets sent by nearly 400,000 Twitter users over 18 months. Analyzing nearly 32,000 neighborhoods and 9,700 homicides in 37 of the largest U.S. cities, we show that neighborhood triple disadvantage independently predicts homicides, adjusting for traditional neighborhood correlates of violence, spatial proximity to disadvantage, prior homicides, and city fixed effects. Not only is triple disadvantage a stronger predictor than traditional measures, it accounts for a sizable portion of the association between residential neighborhood disadvantage and homicides. In turn, potential mechanisms such as neighborhood drug activity, interpersonal friction, and gun crime prevalence account for much of the association between triple disadvantage and homicides. These findings implicate structural mobility patterns as an important source of triple (dis)advantage for neighborhoods and have implications for a broad range of phenomena beyond crime, including community capacity, gentrification, transmission in a pandemic, and racial inequality. © American Sociological Association 2020.

AB  - Palaeoanthropological remains from a multiple grave in the church at Gorzuvity have been examined to obtain information about the time the sepulchral vault was in operation. The minimum number of the individuals in the grave is 20. These are males, females and children of various ages. The radiocarbon dating of 14 samples demonstrates that the funerary construction was used from the 7thtill the 12thcenturies. However, the analysis of the nitrogen and carbon isotopes in the bone tissue collagen suggests a strong reservoir effect caused by consumption of marine food. The tentative period of the vault operation ranges between the 11thand 13thcenturies. Based on the stable isotope data, plant food and sea fish accounted for the largest part of everyday human dietary intake; the share of meat and milk products is likely to have been low. This diet pattern finds analogies in the diet system of medieval Byzantine population in Greece. The data on the isotope composition of strontium from tooth enamel suggest that all individuals lived in similar geochemical conditions; no non-locals from far-away regions have been identified. © 2020 Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Archaeology.

AB  - The criminal mobility of outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) members presents a significant challenge to Australian governments and police. Examining patterns of mobility can help to better understand the opportunity structures that underpin offending by OMCGs and to drive national collaborative responses to these gangs. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of criminal mobility in a sample of almost 4,000 OMCG members in more than 400 chapters. Around one in 10 members showed evidence of criminal mobility over the long term, while more than one-third of chapters comprised criminally mobile members. Criminally mobile gang members were heavily concentrated in a small number of chapters. Patterns of criminal mobility primarily involve movements into east coast jurisdictions. New South Wales and Queensland emerged as the most common destinations for criminally mobile OMCG members. © 2021 Australian Institute of Criminology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Equal access to safe transport is increasingly conceptualised as a fundamental right for women, with demonstrated effects on health outcomes, social and economic mobility and societal participation. This study analysed qualitative and quantitative data to examine travel patterns and experiences among 200 women (aged between 18-64 years) using paid transport for work or educational purposes in Bangladesh. The results showed that the women faced multiple threats to their safety, including gender-based violence, harassment and crime, and traffic and non-traffic injuries, and that the use of paid transport was associated with high levels of anxiety and fear. Despite these circumstances, the women were captive travellers, forced to make transport choices based on price, availability and ease of travel rather than safety. Unable to choose safe transport, the women attempted to mitigate risks by changing their travel patterns and behaviour and by restricting their travel frequency. These findings are discussed within the context of women's rights and mobility justice. © 2021 Queensland University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opportunity theories of crime are concerned with situational predictors of crime and include what Jacques and Wright refer to as the "theoretical siblings": Cornish and Clarke's rational choice perspective and Cohen and Felson's routine activity approach. Routine activity approach posits that crimes take place when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian intersect in space and time. Once presented with a crime opportunity, rational choice perspective suggests that an offender weighs the costs associated with engaging in crime against the potential benefits. Such "rational" decision-making is bounded by one's life circumstances and the available information. Super Mario Bros. is side-scrolling videogame and cultural phenomenon released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The central protagonist of the game, Mario is tasked with making his way through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from her captor, Bowser, King of the Koopa. Along the way, Mario collects coins and various power-ups, and must avoid pitfalls and eliminate enemies. Mario is motivated to collect such targets by his need to survive and complete his mission. Many targets are difficult to reach due to environmental hazards and game enemies serving as guardians over the desired rewards. This chapter provides an explanation of opportunity theory and several theoretical offshoots. Perspectives are applied to Super Mario Bros., and policy implications and empirical evidence of opportunity theories of crime are presented. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - Criminal opportunity theories are an emerging perspective used in place-based criminology to explain why certain locations have more crime than others. These theories suggest the confluence of social and physical characteristics of places can present the necessary "chemistry" for crime incidents to occur there. The Bachelor is a popular reality TV show where one individual gets to simultaneously date different contestants to explore potential relationships with the end goal of providing a marriage proposal to one contestant. This chapter uses criminal opportunity theories to present a framework to understand how the romantic chemistry for a relationship develops on The Bachelor. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new wave of innovations in forensics seeks to support criminal investigations by making inferences about the racial or ethnic appearance of as yet unknown suspects using genetic markers of phenotype or ancestry. This paper argues that to grasp fully the potentials of these innovations they must be understood both in the context of established patterns of police–minority relations and as part of significant changes in the use of ‘race’ as an object of knowledge in science, policy, and politics. Socio-technical developments offer new means of identification through geneticisation, datafication, and visualisation and heighten the visibility and valorisation of racial difference. Elements of this are already evident in existing national police forensic DNA databases whose operation, outcomes, and accompanying ethical frames are racialised in varied ways. By openly mobilising race and ethnicity, however, predictive techniques raise new questions about the validity, interpretation, dissemination, and application of results. Examination of existing use by the police and public of suspect descriptions shows the enduring power of common sense visual and linguistic understandings of race and appearance. That very power makes it hard to transition effectively from moments of collective stigmatisation to the identification of individual suspects. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Fake base station (FBS) has been exploited by criminals to attack mobile users by spamming fraudulent messages for over a decade. Despite that prior work has proposed several techniques to mitigate this issue, FBS spam is still a long-standing challenging issue in some countries, such as China, and causes billions of dollars of financial loss every year. Therefore, understanding and exploring the thematic strategies in the FBS spam ecosystem at a large scale would improve the defense mechanisms. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of FBS spam ecosystem by collecting three-month real-world FBS detection results. First, at "macro-level'', we uncover the characteristics of FBS spammers, including their business categories, temporal patterns and spatial patterns. Second, at "micro-level'', we investigate how FBS ecosystem is organized and how fraudulent messages are constructed by campaigns to trap users and evade detection. Collectively, the results expand our understanding of the FBS spam ecosystem and provide new insights into improved mitigation mechanisms for the security community. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The widespread use of mobile Application rulers has resulted in fraudulent or misleading practises aimed at boosting the visibility of applications in the top suggestion list. Indeed, fake application developers are constantly using fraudulent ratings and fake feedback to raise their app sales and commit fraud. Although the value of preventing these forged activities is widely acknowledged, there is a lack of knowledge and research in this field. In this paper, we suggest using the Aggregation Algorithm to discover rating fraud for mobile apps, a better way to test and analyse the playstore datasets. In particular, we propose that through analysing datasets using an unsupervised learning method and clustering, we can accurately locate rating fraud. Furthermore, it uses a supervised learning strategy. By using statistical hypotheses experiments to model the agglomerative behaviours of apps, We look at five different kinds of evidence: ranking-based proof, number of installations evidences, rating-based evidences, review-based evidences, and App description mining evidences. Finally, after combining all of the evidences, a graphical pattern is created on the imported data, which is used for fraud detection discovery. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2021.

AB  - Boko Haram has caused nearly 40,000 casualties in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad, becoming one of the deadliest Jihadist organisations in recent history. At its current rate, Boko Haram takes part in more than two events each day, taking the lives of nearly 11 people daily. Yet, little is known concerning Boko Haram’s internal structure, organisation, and its mobility. Here, we propose a novel technique to uncover the internal structure of Boko Haram based on the sequence of events in which the terrorist group takes part. Data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) gives the location and time of nearly 3,800 events in which Boko Haram has been involved since the organisation became violent 10 years ago. Using this dataset, we build an algorithm to detect the fragmentation of Boko Haram into multiple cells, assuming that travel costs and reduced familiarity with unknown locations limit the mobility of individual cells. Our results suggest that the terrorist group has a very high level of fragmentation and consists of at least 50–60 separate cells. Our methodology enables us to detect periods of time during which Boko Haram exhibits exceptionally high levels of fragmentation, and identify a number of key routes frequently travelled by separate cells of Boko Haram where military interventions could be concentrated. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The advancement in Information Technology permits high volume of data to be generated in databases of institutions, organizations, government, including Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). Technologies have also been developed to store and manipulate these data to enhance decision making. Crime remains a severe threat to humanity. Criminals currently, exploit highly sophisticated technologies to perform criminal activities. To effectively combat crime, LEAs must be adequately equipped with technological tools such as data mining technology to enable useful discoveries from databases. To achieve this, a Real-time Integrated Crime Information System (RICIS) was developed and mobile phones were used by informants (general public) to capture information about crimes being committed within Southern-East, Nigeria. Each crime information captured is being sent to the LEA responsible for the crime type and the information is stored in the agency database for data analysis. Thus, this study uses data mining algorithms to analyze crime trends and patterns in Southern-Eastern part of Nigeria between 2012 and 2013. The algorithms adopted were Classification and Rule Induction. The data set of 973 were collected from Eleme Police station, PortHarcourt (2012) and Nsukka Police station (2013). The analysis enables identifications of some trends of crimes and criminal activities from various LEAs databases, enhancing crime control and public safety. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The present study sought to elucidate developmental patterns of perceived costs and rewards of offending and examine the relevance of this development for predicting offending in adulthood. The Pathways to Desistance data were used in analyses. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify latent patterns of development for both constructs. Negative binomial regression was used to test the relevance of differential development for predicting offending. A series of generalized estimation equations modeled age-graded changes in offending seriousness across the entire study period for each trajectory group identified in both models. Results indicated that a four-group model best fit the rewards data, while a three-group model best fit the costs data. Perceived rewards trajectory group membership significantly predicted offending in adulthood, with consistently elevated perception of rewards of offending found to be related to increased offending seriousness in adulthood. Differential development of perceived costs did not influence offending in adulthood. Consistently low and declining perceived rewards were associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to participants getting older. Increasing perceived costs of crime were similarly associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to age. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent years, simulation techniques have been applied to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of crime. Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with crime prevention strategies, and exploring crime prediction techniques, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents a simulation model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. The simulation generates patterns of individual mobility aiming to cumulatively match crime patterns. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure, location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as a proxy for human activity, and taxi trip data as a proxy for human movement between regions of the city. We analyze and systematically compare 35 different mobility strategies and demonstrate the benefits of using large-scale human activity data to simulate offender mobility. The strategies combining taxi trip data or historic crime data with popular activity nodes perform best compared to other strategies, especially for robbery. Our approach provides a basis for building agent-based crime simulations that infer offender mobility in urban areas from real-world data. © 2020 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current urban planning of central neighborhoods is focused on mobility transformation towards more sustainable methods of public transportation and walkability that increase social interactions. Central urban neighborhoods in many cities may suffer from deterioration due to lack of personal security that result in diminished walkability. The lack of personal security might exclude residents from those areas and create a troublesome circle of deterioration, and may emphasize spatial inequality. It may also establish different patterns of the neighborhood infrastructure usage for different social groups, such as using specifically more secure streets and public spaces. The main goal of this paper is to define the routes and spaces where people walk and use in their neighborhoods in which they feel safe, and to understand how different social groups walk‐through and use the same urban environment. This is analyzed by the security rating index (SRI) model, a GIS‐based mapping model, which is used to identify and rate secure urban areas for better walkability. The SRI results are compared to an interview, which was given to different social-group representatives, urban data that was collected using a mobile application, and to vandalism data analysis from the municipality. The security and walkability analysis assessment took place in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa, Israel. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The article explores the intersection between paramilitary mobilization and nation-building in the area of Thesprotia in north-western Greece. It does so by examining the activities of the right-wing paramilitaries of EDES (Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Sindesmos – National Republican Greek League) between the Axis occupation and the early Cold War period. Studies of nation-building in twentieth-century Europe have adopted a state-centric approach. More recent scholarship has questioned this approach and presented a more nuanced picture of the nation-making process. A significant strand of this scholarship discusses the role of non-state armed actors–bandits, paramilitaries and criminal gangs–in this process. The present article contributes to this literature by focusing on an aspect of paramilitarism that has largely been overlooked in the existing scholarship: governance. The article discusses patterns of paramilitary governance and explores the impact of wartime rule in local institutions and civilian security, as well as the political legacies of paramilitarism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recent theoretical and methodological advances in urban sociology, including spatially located data, provide new opportunities to consider the joint influence of mobility and place in urban social life. This review defines the concept of activity space, describes its origins in urban sociology, and examines the extent to which activity space approaches advance sociological research in four substantive domains-spatial inequality and segregation, social connectedness and engagement, crime and offending patterns, and health and health-related behavior. It next describes the evolution of methods for location tracking and new approaches that hold promise for maximizing urban mobility and activity space contributions. It then discusses how location data may be augmented to enhance our sociological understanding of the structure, meaning, and implications of the places people visit or traverse in daily life. We close with new directions for activity space research, emphasizing how such work could enable comparative contextual research. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic “edges,” as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In forensic investigations it is often of value to establish whether two phones were used by the same person during a given time period. We present a method that uses time and location of cell tower registrations of mobile phones to assess the strength of evidence that any pair of phones were used by the same person. The method is transparent as it uses logistic regression to discriminate between the hypotheses of same and different user, and a standard kernel density estimation to quantify the weight of evidence in terms of a likelihood ratio. We further add to previous theoretical work by training and validating our method on real world data, paving the way for application in practice. The method shows good performance under different modeling choices and robustness under lower quantity or quality of data. We discuss practical usage in court. © 2019 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences

AB  - Ensuring women's safety in smart cities is a need of the hour. Even though several legal and technological steps are adopted worldwide, women's safety continues to be an international concern. Criminal records are maintained by law enforcement agencies and are most often not available to the public in an easily comprehensible form. While some wearable devices and mobile applications are available which are touted to aid in ensuring women's safety, they utilize limited societal intervention and are not very efficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. Most often the crime response, crime analysis, and crime prevention schemes are not integrated, leading to gaps in ensuring women's safety. Our major contribution is in developing a holistic system encompassing the three crucial aspects, i.e crime analysis and mapping, crime prevention, and emergency response by leveraging societal participation for women safety management. This work applies the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the identification of hotspots and patterns of crime. The proposed system uses data generated from the mobile application and/or wearable gadget prototyped as a part of this work along with the criminal history records for crime response, analysis, and prevention. The system for the hotspot identification is demonstrated for the Pilani town in the Jhunjhunu district in the state of Rajasthan, India, and can be easily scaled up geographically and utilized as a safety strategy for smart cities. While the common man is provided a cost-effective solution via the developed mobile application or wearable gadget, the various components are integrated into a website for supervisory management and can be utilized by law enforcement agencies.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A number of studies have revealed a correlation between bus stops and crimes, especially street robberies. However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Australia is among the countries most exposed to natural hazards, particularly wildfire, cyclones, floods and heat waves. Natural disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity as climate changes. For some people, the increase in risk from these disasters is a reason to move away from certain places or avoid others. Contemporary migration literature has largely ignored environmental factors for mobility, concentrating instead on economic and amenity or lifestyle factors. In this study we fill this gap by exploring the extent to which people in Australia consider natural hazards in their location choices and mobility decisions. Results from a survey using best-worst scaling showed that non-environmental factors prevail, with safety from crime the factor people consider most important when moving somewhere for a new job, followed by living costs and provision of adequate health care. Environmental factors were secondary in people's migration decisions but more important than attractive scenery and educational opportunities. The reasons people in Australia are not particularly dissuaded from moving to places where the prospects of good employment opportunities are high even though they risk the effects of natural disasters, might be a belief in their ability to cope with the disasters should they occur (self-efficacy). Among the environmental factors, high wildfire risk was most important in people's migration decisions, even though the survey was conducted before the devastating wildfires in 2019/20 which were unprecedented in their extent and severity. Wildfires might since have become more important in people's migration decisions, leading to long-term demographic change if people start avoiding high fire risk regions. © 2020

AB  - This article—based on a national data set (N = 173)—focuses on extrafamilial sexual homicides and their spatial mobility. The study combines the location of the crime scene and the offenders and victims’ residences in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the homicides fall within the categories of offender mobility and total mobility. Our results show the validity of the distance decay function, with over 70% of homicides occurring within 10 km of the offender’s residence. It appears that under certain circumstances, sexual murderers perceive their surroundings as a safe place to commit a homicide. Finally, the study proposes a four-category spatial typology of sexual homicide. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The continuous growth of technologies like 4G or 5G has led to a massive use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This phenomenon, combined with the fact that people use mobile phones for a longer period of time, results in mobile phones becoming the main source of creation of visual information. However, its reliability as a true representation of reality cannot be taken for granted due to the constant increase in editing software. This makes it easier to alter original content without leaving a noticeable trace in the modification. Therefore, it is essential to introduce forensic analysis mechanisms to guarantee the authenticity or integrity of a certain digital video, particularly if it may be considered as evidence in legal proceedings. This paper explains the branch of multimedia forensic analysis that allows to determine the identification of the source of acquisition of a certain video by exploiting the unique traces left by the camera sensor of the mobile device in visual content. To do this, a technique that performs the identification of the source of acquisition of digital videos from mobile devices is presented. It involves 3 stages: (1) Extraction of the sensor fingerprint by applying the block-based technique. (2) Filtering the strong component of the PRNU signal to improve the quality of the sensor fingerprint. (3) Classification of digital videos in an open scenario, that is, where the forensic analyst does not need to have access to the device that recorded the video to find out the origin of the video. The main contribution of the proposed technique eliminates the details of the scene to improve the PRNU fingerprint. It should be noted that these techniques are applied to digital images and not to digital videos. In this work, we show that it is necessary to take this improvement into account to improve the identification of digital videos. Experimental results are also presented that support the validity of the techniques used and show promising results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the last few decades, juvenile delinquency in the Republic of Bulgaria has begun to acquire new and specific characteristics. Inexplicable cases of violence are all too common in schools, families and public places. The article analyzes a small part of the theories of juvenile delinquency that exist in the global aspect, which are based on the understanding that criminal acts are determined by mental and behavioral processes at the individual level. According to the theory of rational choice, minors are motivated offenders who subordinate their behavior to a certain goal. Another group of views is defined as theories of biological and psychological traits. Antisocial manifestations are not so much due to the course of certain motivational processes in an individual's mental state, but primarily to the formation of individual patterns of behavior. The article aims to assist Bulgarian criminal law and criminology in clarifying the current circumstances in which juvenile delinquency develops, and the conclusion is that they do not differ significantly from those in the global context. The different perspectives on juvenile delinquency and the interdisciplinary nature of the problems are presented as objectively as possible. Such an approach can lead to a rethinking of the mechanisms and measures that should be applied to achieve the educational purpose of punishment. The analysis presented in the article also supports the introduction of alternative measures to punishment, as well as the achievement of better results in terms of resocialization of juvenile offenders. © St. Petersburg State University, 2021

AB  - Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) is an important methodology in ergonomics for studying workplaces and work patterns. Using eye tracking as a CTA methodology, this article explores visual search patterns in complex work environments and situations. It presents a simulated crime scene case study that applies eye tracking-based experiments in foraging and sense-making loops to elicit and represent knowledge on expert versus novice search patterns for complex work. The case probes the visual search task of preliminarily evaluating and documenting potential crime scene evidence. The experimental protocol relies on the ASL Mobile Eye and the analyses of experimental data include preliminary inspections of live-viewing data on eye-movements, precedence matrices detailing scan paths, and gaze charts that illustrate participants’ attention based on fixation counts and durations. In line with the CTA methodology, the article uses concept maps to represent knowledge derived from different phases of the study. The article also discusses the research implications and methodologically reflects on the case study. Practitioner summary: This study offers valuable insights for work design. The use of eye tracking as a CTA methodology offers potentials for translating visual search tasks into defined visual search concepts for complex work environments and situations. The ability to model visual attention is valuable for work designs that improve complex work performance, reduce work stress, and promote work satisfaction. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While varying factors have been adduced as facilitators of budding patterns of irregular mobility across the Sahara, a pivotal issue of concern amid the crisis has been lack of appropriate gender profiling of various actors. Engaging an exploratory design (which combines case profiling, in-depth interviews [IDIs], and focus group discussions [FGDs]) and ‘actor-network’ theoretical approach, which affirms the significance of both human and nonhuman agencies in processes of irregular transnational mobility, this study assesses the interpositions of gender and migrants’ smuggling along the Nigerian–Libyan migratory corridor. Although organized crime is explored as a general notion, the emphasis in the study has been on specific gender roles of individual actors (between the point of migrants’ departure [Benin City, Nigeria] and the point of migrants’ processing [Agadez, Niger Republic]). Of what significance are gender categories (male and female) in the recruitment of ‘organizers’ and ‘subjects’ of migrants’ smuggling within these study locations? Though it has been assumed that the female gender has often been at the receiving end of most organized irregular mobilities along the Nigerian–Libyan corridor, findings from this study have shown that female network actors have been as active as their male network counterparts in processes of migrants’ smuggling. The outcomes of this study have been particularly useful in situating the interpositions of gender and smuggling of migrants along the Nigerian–Libyan corridor within an appropriate epistemological context. © 2020 Oriental Institute of Cultural and Social Research and SAGE Publications.

AB  - The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper is going to present a hybrid model for IDS using ANN and data mining approaches. it is important to deploy a hybrid network using ANN based and data mining based IDS systems that can enable the system in making decisions on intrusion in a mobile environment. MANET is an infrastructure-less ad-hoc network. It is a collection of mobile nodes that are connected in an arbitrary and dynamic manner. ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is a type of Machine Learning scientific and statistical model that is used by computer systems in order to perform a task without involvement of explicit intrusion, rather than relying on interference and patterns instead. As there is node mobility that can impose different security issues, MANETs are found more susceptible in security provision. In order to resolve this security issue, some authentication and encryption techniques can be proposed for the first-line defensein order to mitigate the security risks. However, complete eradication of these types of risks is next to impossible. For theSecond line defense, the necessity of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential in this case. IDS can be referred as a method tool or resource that can help to detect access and warn for any activity of unapproved or unauthorized network activity. The current research has been done to prevent the network from the intruders. The number of attackers has been increased in the network because of more usage of technology and wireless network. Data is not allowed by the attackers to transmit successfully from source node to destination node. These intruders want to steal data and let to the unsuccessful transmission. In this research we are deploying 48 to 66 nodes in a defined communication area of 1000*1000 height and width. While starting the transmission source node and destination node is defined. After that while using IDS and AODV protocol route is created between destination and source node. If network decreases its performance will need to apply cuckoo search as an optimization algorithm. Cuckoo search algorithm extracts the properties and observe the energy been consumed by each node. Optimized properties provided as an input to the decision tree classifier with the help of this, system is being prepared according to their properties. If there will be a chance for existence of intruder in the network then it will be classified using decision tree algorithm. At the end QOS parameters energy consumption is performed using cuckoo search optimization algorithm. The detected intruder is prevented using decision tree and removed from the MANET network.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Psychoactive tryptamines are naturally found in toads, plants, and mushrooms. However, due to the hallucinogenic effect of tryptamine derivatives, they have been abused illegally by more and more users. The wide distribution of designer tryptamines has become a serious social problem, because they can cause serious damage to health and their psychotropic effects can lead to criminal activity. Some of tryptamines are controlled as narcotics under the Administration of Non-Pharmaceutical Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in China, such as 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DMT and so on. However, if they become controlled, new compounds with similar structures will then spread throughout the drug market. For known new psychoactive substances, mass spectra are compared with reference standards to identify the detected compounds. Nevertheless, in the case of such dynamic growth in the number of new substances on the drug market, the novel compound is often not already added to the spectra library. Without a reference standard, the compound must be identified from a detailed study of its mass spectra. Due to the limited applicability of spectral libraries, knowledge on fragmentation patterns of particular groups of new psychoactive substances is necessary to predict the structures of novel compounds. In 2015-2019, a series of eleven tryptamines were identified as new psychoactive substances in China. In this work, a fast and simple approach for the screening and identification of tryptamines was proposed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS). Compounds were analyzed on Aglient DB-5 MS column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm) with an initial temperature of 140 ℃ for gradient increased temperature by GC-MS and Acquity UPLC CSHTM C18 column (10 cm×2.1 mm×1.7 μm) with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A)-acetonitrile (B) as mobile phase for gradient elution by UPLC-QTOF MS. The fragmentation behaviors especially the MS fragmentation rules were compared and summarized. According to the structure and the typical fragmentations, these compounds can be easily identified. This method is fast and accurate, and can be used for analysising different types of tryptamines. So this work will be helpful to assist forensic laboratories in identifying these kinds of compounds or other substances with similar structure in their case work. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Chinese Mass Spectrometry Society.

AB  - In Recent days, social networks, web applications and mobile platforms make consumers highly vulnerable. A modern approach requires more time to detect the attacks. However, the system has a very restricted knowledge of network malware behavior. It is essential for defenders to know malware behaviors, such as patterns of propagation or membership recruitment, the size of botnets, and distribution of bots, in order to fight against cyber-crime. Where, there is no strong knowledge of the size and allocation of malware in existing systems. To overcome the issues, the proposed method is designed efficient and secure trusted routing mechanism (ESTRM), which promotes a node to choose a different path if the present path often fails to deliver information to the destination. The proposed technique provides privacy from serious assaults for software defined networks by replaying routing data. Based on experiment evaluations, the proposed method improves 5.58 detection accuracy and reduces 0.35 true positive rate (TPR), 0.34 false positive rates (FPR) and 0.19 s execution time (ET) compare than conventional methods. © 2020

AB  - Mobile Social Networks have become one of the most convenient services for users to share information everywhere. This crowdsourced information is often meaningful and recommended to users, e.g., reviews on Yelp or high marks on Dianping, which poses the threat of Sybil attacks. To address the problem of Sybil attacks, previous solutions mostly use indirect/direct graph model or clickstream model to detect fake accounts. However, they are either dependent on strong connections or solely preserved by servers of social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel predictable approach by exploiting users’ custom patterns to distinguish Sybil attackers from normal users for the application of recommendation in mobile social networks. First, we introduce the entropy of spatial-temporal features to profile the mobility traces of normal users, which is quite different from Sybil attackers. Second, we develop discriminative entropy-based features, i.e., users’ preference features, to measure the uncertainty of users’ behaviors. Third, we design a smart Sybil detection model based on a binary classification approach by combining our entropy-based features with traditional behavior-based features. Finally, we examine our model and carry out extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Dianping. Our results have demonstrated that the model can significantly improve the detection accuracy of Sybil attacks. ©2021 IEEE.

AB  - Schools in America may provide opportunities for upward mobility while also perpetuating social inequality. The inequities found in the US public school system probably result in such a highly stratified society. Conditions found in many schools and classrooms are often a microcosm of the same conditions and factors present in the broader American society. Scholars and education reform activists often use the term school-to-prison pipeline to describe what they view as a widespread pattern in the United States of pushing students, especially those who are already at a disadvantage, out of school, and into the criminal justice system. This research explored whether mentorship in the lives of these very students can affect the trajectory that these students take in life by moving toward a pedagogy of liberation that challenges the inequities and contradictions in the institution of education. Building from a model similar to CDF Freedom Schools, but targeting academic enrichment, Farrah and her colleague Hope developed the Sankofa Project at Yin Elementary School (YES). Embracing both the social-emotional and pedagogical aspects of CDF Freedom Schools, the Sankofa Project moved from a mission that sought to instill a love for reading to actually teaching children to read. This aspect was pivotally important to Farrah and Hope as they sought to dismantle the “cradle to prison pipeline,” the concept of funneling masses of people into marginalized lives, imprisonment, and often premature death. Farrah believed that all her predecessors had done “was spot on, but academic enrichment was a key to steering children away from the pipeline.” With the rebirth of a caste-like system in America, black and brown bodies are disproportionately locked behind bars, relegated permanent second-class status if declared a felon and an increasingly common trend toward annihilation at the hands of those of who are designated to serve and protect them. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This paper analyzes crime reports and police activity in Rio de Janeiro during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate there was an overall drop in crime rates starting in April, especially in property crimes, which plummet to extremely unusual levels when compared with previous patterns. This pattern is most likely associated with an unprecedented decline in public mobility in some areas of the state. We show that the most significant reductions in street robberies occurred in neighborhoods where there was a greater decline in presence on the streets. Measures of police activity, in particular drug seizures and different types of arrests, dis-played a reduction comparable with the drop in criminal indicators. In contrast, the number of police killings followed a unique pattern: in April, immediately after the adoption of social distance measures, this indicator increased abo-ve the average from the previous four years; as of May, however, it assumed a downward trend, which turned into extraordinarily low levels in June. The extreme variation in the use of force by the police during the pandemic reinforces the documented dissonance between police lethality and criminal dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, shed-ding light on the mechanisms that regulate police violence in the state. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Communication surveillance, one of the main tools used in investigations of drug trafficking, is used to reconstruct criminal activity, identify the offenders, determine their respective roles within the trafficking operation, and eventually locate them. Research into the use of telephone data to study criminal groups currently relies mainly on transcripts of phone conversations obtained through police wiretapping. Our exploratory research also benefited from privileged access to telephone data from wiretaps and records of call details collected both in real time and retrospectively during investigations. Our research focuses on the relation between the roles of individuals involved in drug trafficking and the spatial patterns detected in telephone communications. We asked whether the role of a protagonist - his/her function and place within a trafficking group - can be inferred from telephone activities and addressed this question through a spatiotemporal analysis of call detail records and wiretaps from 20 individuals implicated in drug trafficking. The selected individuals could be classified into three different roles : Dealer, mid-level or high-level wholesaler, and cross-border or national courier. To determine their mobility, median locations, convex-hull areas, and the average distance travelled per day were calculated for each individual and by role type. The results support the hypothesis that individual roles influence the patterns found in telephone data. Couriers can be differentiated from dealers and wholesalers based on identifiable geographic patterns. Dealers can also be distinguished from wholesalers. These results confirm the proposed approach and reveal the potential of the analysis of telephone data to infer roles in drug trafficking. © 2020 Presses de l'Universite de Montreal.

AB  - Nowadays, mobile devices have become the natural substitute for the digital camera, as they capture everyday situations easily and quickly, encouraging users to express themselves through images and videos. These videos can be shared across different platforms exposing them to any kind of intentional manipulation by criminals who are aware of the weaknesses of forensic techniques to accuse an innocent person or exonerate a guilty person in a judicial process. Commonly, manufacturers do not comply 100% with the specifications of the standards for the creation of videos. Also, videos shared on social networks, and instant messaging applications go through filtering and compression processes to reduce their size, facilitate their transfer, and optimize storage on their platforms. The omission of specifications and results of transformations carried out by the platforms embed a features pattern in the multimedia container of the videos. These patterns make it possible to distinguish the brand of the device that generated the video, social network, and instant messaging application that was used for the transfer. Research in recent years has focused on the analysis of AVI containers and tiny video datasets. This work presents a novel technique to detect possible attacks against MP4, MOV, and 3GP format videos that affect their integrity and authenticity. The method is based on the analysis of the structure of video containers generated by mobile devices and their behavior when shared through social networks, instant messaging applications, or manipulated by editing programs. The objectives of the proposal are to verify the integrity of videos, identify the source of acquisition and distinguish between original and manipulated videos. © 2020

AB  - The study of the impact of modern technologies and, in particular, digitalization on the transformation and future development of industries, as well as changes in economic models both within the industry itself and at the level of one state, and in interstate economic relations, is one of the new areas of research in the global economy originating from the very nascent phenomenon. The object of this study is the automotive industry. However, the changing processes presented in this article affect many other industries. Digitalization will require not only new strategies from manufacturers trying to gain competitive advantages, but also a state that is responding to new reality to protect personal data and personal space of citizens. In this sample-structured document, neither the cross-linking of float elements and bibliography nor metadata/copyright information is available. The sample document is provided in "Draft"mode and to view it in the final layout format, applying the required template is essential with some standard steps. These steps, which should require generation of the final output from the styled paper, are mentioned here in this paragraph. First, users have to run "Reference Numbering"from the "Reference Elements"menu; this is the first step to start the bibliography marking (it should be clicked while keeping the cursor at the beginning of the reference list). After the marking is complete, the reference element runs all the options under the "Cross Linking"menu. The authors base their research on consistent patterns characterizing the dependence of industrial development on the general economic situation. To analyze the processes occurring in industries under the influence of new technologies, a comparative analysis of the research materials of international research companies, world economic communities and advanced technological auto giants is carried out. The approaches used in the research include a prognostic analysis of the behavior of market entities under the influence of new digital technologies. Digital transformation is changing the traditional business model and value chain. The emerging trends are personalization of services and individual customer interaction solutions: Omnichannel pre-sales engagement, customized driving experience, targeted mobility, IoT integration, car dealerships, personalized insurance, personalized data insurance, car sharing customer profiles, etc. As the industry moves from the simple production of an automobile to the creation of an intelligent, connected digital transport hub, companies need to adapt to the value chain and life cycle of the client, not the car. Connected cars will be a continuation and expression of the individuality and style of the client, like the revolution of mobile phones. Digital transformation in the automotive industry will bring positive transformations for both consumers and society as a whole, affecting the environment at the same time and creating new jobs, which, of course, should attract attention and be supported by the state as a regulatory body. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Traditionally, historical crimes and socioeconomic data have been used to understand crime in cities and to build crime prediction models. Nevertheless, the increasing availability of mobility data from cell phones to location-based services, has introduced a new family of mobility-based crime prediction models that exploit the relation between mobility patterns and reported crime incidents. One of the major concerns of using reported crime data is underreporting, which will bias the crime predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Hierarchical model that utilizes domain knowledge about biases in reported crime data to characterize and enhance fairness and accuracy in mobility-based crime predictions. An in-depth feature analysis reveals the influence that various factors might play in crime under-reporting and algorithmic fairness for mobility-based crime predictors.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The credit/debit card deceit detection is an enormously difficult task. However, it is a well known problem of our cloud based mobile internet society and it must be solved by technocrats in the welfare of societal mental harassments. The main problem in executing credit/debit card fraud detection technique is the availability of limited amount of fraud related data like transaction amount, transaction date, transaction time, address, and vendor category code related to the frauds. It is the truth of mobile internet world that there are billions of potential places and e-commerce websites where a credit/debit card can be used by fraudulent people for online transactions and payments which make it exceedingly thorny to trace the pattern of frauds. Moreover, the problem of fraud detection in cloud— Internet of Things (IoT) based smart societies has numerous constraints like continuous change in the behavior of normal and fraudulent persons, the fraudulent people try to develop and use new method for executing frauds, and very little availability of frauds related bench mark data sets. In this research article, the authors have presented logistic regression based k-fold machine learning technique (MLT) for fraud detection and prevention in cloud-IoT based smart societal environment. The k-fold method creates multiple folds of bank transactions related data before implementing logistic regression and MLT. The logistic regression performs logic based regression analysis and the intelligent machine learning approach performs registration, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning, training, and reinforcement learning steps on the received bank transactions data. The implementation of proposed methodology and its further analysis using intelligent machine learning tools like ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, confusion matrix, mean-recall score value, and precision recall curves for European banks day-to-day transactions related bench mark data set reveal that the proposed methodology is efficient, accurate, and reliable for detecting frauds in cloud-IoT based smart societal environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this age of information, we can’t think a day without our cell phone which is a very important component in storing data which is mostly personal. In recent times we are using E-banking, E-shopping and personal messaging photo sharing, we use many social media applications etc. So it is a basic understanding that our mobile phone security system is very important. Now a days it’s very common to have patterns, pins and gestures-based security options. Since it is very common to have one these systems on devices, attackers are always developing new ways to bypass these security systems using attacks like smudge detection, shoulder surfing, gesture recognition and using a dictionary attack (brute force method) any pattern or PIN can be exposed with given time. In our proposed model through randomizing PIN number position on the phone screen and use of vibration as pin input we have sufficiently secured the user’s password from smudge attacks, shoulder surfing and gesture recognition also we have delayed the chance of being successful in a brute force attack as we have used vibration as a variable (and by limiting the attempt). In our proposed model we also designed the lock system app interface where the input buttons size and distance between two buttons are more than standard so that will help to reduce the human error and provides more comfort in use. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Water short circuiting leading to early, sudden and massive water breakthroughs in producer wells has been a lingering concern to oil operators for many years. Unfavorable mobility ratio leading to viscous fingering, horizontal wells exhibiting 'the heel-toe effect' and fields with fracture-fault activities are more prone to these kinds of unwanted water breakthroughs, suffering from oil production losses and higher operational cost for management of the excessive produced water. A brown field in the south of the Sultanate of Oman was experiencing massive water short circuiting within two of its patterns. [MJO1]While conformance was well established and dynamically confirmed through production performance and artificial lift parameters in most patterns within the field, the complicated inverted nine spot injector-producer pattern scenario[MJO2] was making it difficult to ascertain the offending injectors or unexpected flow paths leading to the condition within the study area. The lower API oil and slightly fractured and faulted geology was exhibiting conditions for injection imbalance and the challenge was to bring the high water-cut wells back to full potential and increase oil output whilst reducing water flow. To investigate the breakthrough occurrences and mitigate the challenge, chemical water tracers were introduced in the reservoir as a part of Integrated Reservoir Management framework to identify flow directions and offending injectors. The Phase-1 of the two-phase study, discussed in this paper, was carried out to determine reservoir conformance that was contributing to short circuiting and once the cause was identified and treated, Phase-2 was carried out post well intervention to validate the success of the treatment. Phase-1 of the tracer study was initiated in October 2019 where two injectors and nineteen producers across two adjacent patterns were traced with two unique chemical water tracers. Massive tracer responses were obtained within the first few days in few wells, directly pointing out towards the offending injector(s). Sampling and analysis for Phase-1 was continued for about six months, after which, a zonal isolation was carried out in one the identified injectors in August 2020. Cement was pumped across all the perforation intervals and a new perforation was performed across the top and bottom of the reservoir avoiding the middle intervals that were taking about 70% of injection as per production logging. Phase-2 of the study was initiated in March 2021 and continued sampling and analyses are still being carried out. With about 15% reduction in water cut and a three-fold increase in oil rate at the target producer, the study validated that an integrated knowledge of reservoir geology and production behavior coupled with tracer studies was a very successful strategy for managing short circuiting in waterflood reservoirs. The study showed that this sequence and combination of methods can be useful in effective treatment for wells experiencing high water cut across the world. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

AB  - With about 12 million inhabitants, São Paulo, Brazil, is the largest city in South America. As in many other major southern hemisphere cities, this extreme concentration of people imposes a number of mobility and security challenges. The objective of this article was to investigate the space-time patterns of mobility and violent victimisation in São Paulo’s metro stations from a gender perspective. The methodology combines use of a Geographical Information System (GIS), statistical analysis through negative binomial regression modelling and hypothesis testing. Results indicate that mobility and the level of victimisation are gender dependent. Women are at higher risk of victimisation than men in São Paulo’s central metro station, while men run higher risk of violence at end stations – both notably during late night periods. The presence of employees reduces the risk of violence, except during the mornings. The article suggests that crime prevention initiatives need to be gender informed and sensitive to the particular spatial and temporal features of rapid transit environments. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.

AB  - In today’s modern world, mobile has turned out to be one of the essentials for all the people irrespective of their status and profession. With the help of this device, all the data about a person can be tracked down (i.e. from the diet, diseases to contacts and transactions). In case of criminal investigations, inspectors need to collect information about a victim or accused. For this, the individual’s mobile phone plays a vital role. However, it is very difficult to access a device without its owner’s permission. Suppose, if the victim is dead or not willing to expose the information, the cyber police should perform many complex tasks to retrieve the data. Thus, there is a great need to analyze this task and make it feasible to find out pass-codes in order to access the mobile device. This paper explains how passwords can be cracked with ease with the help of survey and training of large dataset. We all know that people these days are very active on social media, which makes it easy to track them. In this work, we analyze a few passcodes and patterns and try to test that data by giving the queries. Here, we can analyze and retrieve the data from an individual’s social media such as date of birth, name, personal information and try to predict the passcode in very few attempts as it turns out that majority of the time, the passcode is generally predictable based on some key characteristics identified in this paper. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Micromobility aims to provide environmentally friendly options for trips that cannot be accomplished with public transport and reduce automobile dependence. The most recent transport mode for accomplishing such trips is the electric scooter (e-scooter) and they have flooded several countries and cities taking a significant share of trips. However, there is little guidance regarding their operations and initial observations demonstrate public disdain. This article deals with the evaluation of the public opinion in regard to e-scooters based on those who do not use them. To solicit input, an in-person and an electronic questionnaire were used in Thessaloniki, Greece. Statistical analysis of the collected data was undertaken to establish possible pattern of public opinion and identify situations of e-scooters that cause problems in pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic. Furthermore, the lack of infrastructure, which is a deterrent to e-scooter use, and the absence of a legislative framework that sets out the rules for traffic seem to be main concerns. Finally, the surveys noted that e-scooters will be promoted and integrated into traffic by designing and building adequate infrastructure, training users in Highway Code and imposing fines on offenders. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objectives: Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us? Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets. Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5G and IoT are two path-breaking technologies, and they are like wall and climbers, where IoT as a climber is growing tremendously, taking the support of 5G as a wall. The main challenge that emerges here is to secure the ecosystem created by the collaboration of 5G and IoT, which consists of a network, users, endpoints, devices, and data. Other than underlying and hereditary security issues, they bring many Zero-day vulnerabilities, which always pose a risk. This paper proposes a security solution using network slicing, where each slice serves customers with different problems. 5G and IoT are a combination of technology that will enhance the user experience and add many security issues to existing ones like DDoS, DoS. This paper aims to solve some of these problems by using network slicing and implementing an Intrusion Detection System to identify and isolate the compromised resources. This paper proposes a 5G-IoT architecture using network slicing. Research here is an advancement to our previous implementation, a Python-based software divided into five different modules. This paper's amplification includes induction of security using pattern matching intrusion detection methods and conducting tests in five different scenarios, with 1000 up to 5000 devices in different security modes. This enhancement in security helps differentiate and isolate attacks on IoT endpoints, base stations, and slices. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

AB  - Understanding offender motivation is key to developing effective crime reduction policies. Criminological theories seeking to explain offender motivations are plentiful—some argue for a pure utilitarian agenda driven by opportunity (rational choice), others for the influence of socially constructed standards of behavior (strain, learning), and still others argue for accounting for multiple layers of influence (crime pattern theory). Though these theories have been used to explain the presence of antiquities looting, few have sought to examine offender motivations specifically due to a lack of data. But what kind of data should those interested in offender motivations be looking for? How does this align with possible underlying theoretical motivations? This study speaks to these questions by first considering how criminological theoretical paradigms account for antiquities looter motivations. Then, it traces how to approach examining looting motivation by identifying the types of evidence and data needed to test theoretical predictions and which methodologies would be appropriate for such an analysis. Finally, this study demonstrates this approach using case study featuring a newly collected spatiotemporal dataset on antiquities looting in Egypt. Looking from 2015 to 2017, this study will determine what can be learned about possible offender motivations in Egypt at this time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Advertising income depends on the amount of clicks by users of websites and mobile applications. However, the emergence of click fraud greatly reduces the real benefits of the advertisement. Most existing researches focus on detecting click fraud by analyzing properties and patterns of click data streams, but attackers can construct data that looks legitimate by replaying former data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel system called ClickGuard to detect click fraud attacks. ClickGuard takes advantage of motion sensor signals from mobile devices, since the pattern of motion signals is completely different under real click events and fraud events. To prevent attackers from bypassing the system by faking the time-domain statistical characteristics of original signals, we introduce the MFCC algorithm in feature extraction phase. MFCC algorithm can extract frequency-domain features of original signals in specific frequency bands which are hardly constructed out of thin air. Classifiers are finally constructed using these features and several machine learning algorithms. Experiments show that ClickGuard can achieve the accuracy of 96.71% in general environment and 84.16% when attackers modify the time-domain statistical characteristics of raw data. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - There is a popular supposition that domestic population mobility in the United States has been steadily decreasing since the 1980s. However, some scholars believe the declining rate of American internal migration seems to have ‘slowed down’ obviously from 2007. This debate prompts us to quantitatively analyze the possible changes in migration patterns and the mechanisms of domestic population mobility. First, using empirical data of state-to-state migration, the paper quantifies American internal mobility and the evolution of migration patterns for the period from 2005–2015. Regional income disparities cannot explain the change in population migration patterns in the United States well. Then, the mobility barriers are estimated by an extended multilateral migration model that reveals a marked decrease in regional migration costs and an increase in individual rational choices, which are the critical factors in the structural changes in the migration pattern. Subsequently, we deconstruct the mobility barriers and indicate that in recent years, the human and natural environments had a great impact on population movement in the United States, such as the human development index, education grade, climate, cost of living index, house price index, and crime rate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Today traditional communication methods, such as SMS or phone calls, are used less often and are replaced by the use of chat applications. WhatsApp is one of the most popular chat applications nowadays. WhatsApp offers different ways of communicating, which include sending text messages and making phone calls. The implementation of encryption makes WhatsApp more challenging for law enforcement agencies to identify when a suspect is sending or receiving messages via this chat application. Most research in literature focused on the analysis of WhatsApp data by obtaining information from a physical device, such as a seized mobile device. However, it is not always possible to extract the data needed from a mobile device for the analysis of the WhatsApp data because of the encryption, or no devices have been seized yet. In addition, the current techniques for real time analysis of WhatsApp messages show that there is a high risk of detection by the suspect. Alternative methods are needed to understand the communication patterns of a suspect and criminal organizations. In this paper, we focused on identifying when a suspect is receiving or sending WhatsApp messages using only wiretap data. Therefore, no seized devices are needed. The pattern analysis has been used to identify patterns of data sent to and received from the WhatsApp servers. The identified patterns were tested against a large dataset created with different mobile devices to determine if the patterns are consistent. By using the technique described in this paper, investigators will obtain more information if and with whom a suspect is communicating. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Mobile advertising has become inarguably one of the fastest growing industries all over the world. The influx of capital attracts increasing fraudsters to defraud money from advertisers. There are many tricks a fraudster can leverage, among which bot install fraud is undoubtedly the most insidious one due to its ability to implement sophisticated behavioral patterns and emulate normal users, so as to evade from detection rules defined by human experts. In this work, we propose an anti-fraud method based on heterogeneous graph that incorporates both local context and global context via graph neural networks (GNN) and gradient boosting classifier to detect bot fraud installs at Mobvista, a leading global mobile advertising company. Offline evaluations in two datasets show the proposed method outperforms all the competitive baseline methods by at least 2.2% in the first dataset and 5.75% in the second dataset given the evaluation metric Recall@90% Precision. Furthermore, we deploy our method to tackle million-scale data daily at Mobvista. The online performance also shows that the proposed methods consistently detect more bots than other baseline methods. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Considering both the relevance of accessibility to urban goods and services or geography of opportunities in the quality of life of urban inhabitants, and the fact that walking represents the main mode of transportation in Greater Santiago —34,6% of trips, according to EOD 2012 (Universidad Alberto Hurtado, 2014)—, the aim of this research is to analyze and compare the structural barriers that affect the walkable area at the neighborhood scale, as well as estimate their possible effects on mobility patterns and access to goods and services, in three housing estates in Greater Santiago: Población Juan Antonio Ríos, sector 3B (Independencia), Villa San Cristóbal (Recoleta) and Villa Los Sauces (La Florida). For each case, the main material barriers are identified, whether natural (rivers, hills) or artificial (roads, under/ over crossings) and some of intangible barriers (associated with road or crime safety). The maximum theoretical area (Euclidean) and that of the “actual” walkable neighbourhood are compared through network analysis (based on 20 minute journeys), considering the crossing conditions of main roads, quantifying the effects over time and distance, and accessibility to goods and services. In addition, the configuration of the road and pedestrian network is analysed, contrasting their local and global integration, based on axial maps. Finally, the movement patterns of the inhabitants is analysed based on the EOD data. The results showed a clear decrease of the actual walkable neighbourhood area (to one third of the Euclidian area) product of the urban grid and the various existing barriers, which reflects on the accessibility to goods and services by walking. These results allow us also to propose that although a greater average distance is not related to a greater walkable area, closeness to well served centralities associate to in with the prevalence of walking as a transport mode. © 2020 Universidad Diego Portales.

AB  - To prevent obesity among Latino youth in the United States and Latin America, it is necessary to understand the specific context and interplay of physical activity (PA) and the built environment (BE). This paper aims to advance the research agenda of BE and PA for obesity prevention in Latin America and among Latino youth in the United States by (1) identifying environmental indicators to inform the design of interventions and policy, (2) identifying interdisciplinary methodological approaches for the study of the complex association between BE and PA, and (3) presenting case studies of PA-promoting BE programs. A group of U.S. and Latin American scientists collaboratively worked to propose innovative indicators of the BE, methodological approaches for the study of the complex association between BE and PA, and review case studies of PA-promoting BE programs in both regions. The results identified gaps in knowledge, proposed environmental indicators (e.g., landscape, street design, mobility patterns, and crime and safety), reviewed methodological approaches (social network analysis, citizen science methods), and case studies illustrating PA-promoting BE programs (i.e., play streets, active school transport, and school setting interventions). The obesity prevention among Latino and Latin American youth requires advanced research on BE and PA addressing context-specific priorities and exchanging lessons learned. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In the South Asian setting, the fields of gender history and family history are still predominantly concerned with relatively elite social groups. Few studies have examined issues of gender and the family in the history of Dalit, low-caste, and socially marginalized communities, especially those that were labelled 'criminal tribes' from the mid-nineteenth century on. This article explores the ways in which gender patterned criminalized communities' experiences of everyday colonial governance under Part I of the 1871 Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) in the first two decades that it was enforced in northern India. In this early period, the colonial government did not closely regulate marriage practices, domestic arrangements, or the gendered organization of labour within communities categorized as 'criminal tribes'. Nevertheless, notions of sexuality and gender underlay colonial knowledge of the 'criminal tribes', which emerged in dialogue with middle-class Indian gender and caste politics. Moreover, the family unit was the central target of the CTA surveillance and policing regime, which aimed to produce 'industrious' families. Officially endorsed forms of labour had complex implications for criminalized communities in the context of North Indian gender norms and strategies of social mobility. Gender power dynamics also shaped criminalized peoples' interpersonal, embodied interactions with British and Indian colonial officials on an everyday basis. Meanwhile, different forms of leverage and evasion were open to men and women to cope with their criminalization and so the colonial state was experienced in highly gendered ways. © Cambridge University Press 2020

AB  - A vehicular Adhoc Network, a subfield of Mobile Adhoc Network is defined by its high mobility and by demonstrating dissimilar mobility patterns. So, VANET clustering techniques are needed with the consideration of the mobility parameters amongst nearby nodes to construct stable clustering techniques. At the same time, security is also a major design issue in VANET which can be resolved by the Intrusion Detection Systems. In contrast to the conventional IDS, VANET based IDS are required to be designed in such a way that the functioning of the system does not affect the real-time efficiency of the performance of VANET applications. With this motivation, this paper presents an efficient Fuzzy Logic based Clustering with optimal Fuzzy Support Vector Machine, called FLC-OFSVM based Intrusion Detection System for VANET. The proposed FLC-OFSVM model involves two stages of operations namely clustering and intrusion detection. Primarily, FLC technique is employed to select an appropriate set of cluster heads and construct clusters. Besides, a lightweight anomaly IDS model named FSVM optimized with krill herd optimization algorithm is developed to detect the existence of malevolent attacks in VANET. The KH algorithm which is based on the herding behavior of krillsis used to optimally tune the parameters of the FSVM model. In order to investigate the performance of the FLC-OFSVM model, an extensive set of simulations are carried out and the results are investigated in terms of several performance measures. © 2021, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

AB  - Identifying an unfamiliar caller's profession is important to protect citizens' personal safety and property. Due to limited data protection of many popular online services in some countries such as taxi hailing or takeouts ordering, many users encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. This may aggravate the situation that criminals pretend to be delivery staff or taxi drivers, bringing threats to the society. Additionally, many people nowadays suffer from excessive digital marketing and fraud phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, and do not work for identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones which may show their Apps preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession related information. This offers us a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies or regulations (e.g. GDPR 71). Using appropriate statistical methods to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, provides a way to identify mobile phone callers without privacy concern. In this paper, we exploit privacy-preserving mobile data to develop a model which can automatically identify the callers who are divided into four categories of users: normal users (other professions), taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters. The validation results over an anonymized dataset of 1, 282 users with a period of 3 months in Shanghai City prove that the proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 75+%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - New technologies for recording, reproducing, and disseminating sound are increasingly accessible and provide important opportunities for listening to accounts of confinement. Through a politics and practice of ‘earwitnessing detention’, this article explores experiential patterns and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By ‘tuning in’ to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of ‘indefinite stuckness’. Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity for respite from the ‘chaos’ outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies indefinite stuckness. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) refers to classifying trajectories into the corresponding generated users and has emerged as an essential spatio-temporal data mining task with a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from personalized location recommendation and trip planning to criminal behavior detection and object tracking. Despite the progress made by recent deep learning-based human mobility learning models, some critical factors related to personal context and user-location interactions have not yet been fully explored. Besides, existing works suffer from high computational cost issues due to the increased complexity of trajectory learning and contextual location embedding. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end model called GNNTUL, composed of a graph neural network (GNN) module and a classifier, to effectively and efficiently learn human mobility and associate the traces to the users in online social networks. GNNTUL is the first GNN-based human mobility learning model exploiting implicit transition patterns behind sparse user traces in online social networks while extracting users' unique motion features and discriminating the motion traces. Extensive experiments conducted on two real- world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNNTUL over several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both linking accuracy and learning efficiency. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Crime is an unlawful event which affects the harmony of humanity. Whoever got victimized in a crime, it affects them both physically and mentally. Hence, they are haunted by the memories throughout their life. Due to the limitations, traditional data collection and analysis methods are not very effective now. Yesteryears, the researches were concentrating on demographic features of the population. Nowadays, the dynamic characteristics of individual or specific group could easily be extracted from the search engines, social media, e-commerce platforms, mobile applications, IOT devices, surveillance cameras, sensors and geographical information systems. The recent technological advancements are helpful in integration of data from various sources, classification of information into granular level, identification of crime sequences and designing a framework. Particularly, the artificial intelligence methodology called deep learning imitates the functions of human brain and able to acquire knowledge from unstructured data. It makes revolutionary changes in crime forecasting, predictive policing and legal strategy formulations. The following survey explores the possibilities of scrutinizing the data from huge repositories, analyzing various socioeconomic factors associated to the crime incidents, identifying the outliers, categorizing the patterns and designing effective computational models to predict crimes by using data mining and machine learning techniques. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The use of psychoactive substances increases university students’ general morbidity and mortality. Universities run programs to prevent psychoactive substance use since they are associated with the risk of poor academic outcomes. The University of Nairobi (UoN) trains peer mentors who counsel students to prevent substance use. There is, however, inadequate feedback and no evaluation of the effectiveness of this method. This study will pilot mobile health (mHealth) based peer mentoring, evaluate and provide feedback about implementation. It will be based in two campuses of UoN, Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Three phases study. In the first phase, a baseline survey determines students’ knowledge about, attitudes toward, and prevalence of substance use at baseline and the end of the intervention phase. Second phase, mHealth based intervention using a quasi-experimental design. Participants 100 mentors (50 intervention and 50 control groups). Intervention group using mHealth screens for substance use, provide structured brief intervention and treatment referral. A comparative control group, using a paper-based guide will deliver the same program. Phase three, mentors during focussed group discussions will share their experiences. Results: Data will be collected on implementation, acceptability and substance use patterns. Data analysis using descriptive, inferential statistics and thematic content analysis for qualitative data. Conclusions: The study will provide evidence on the implementation and acceptability of mHealth among university students. This will inform national and regional substance use prevention policy and practice.

AB  - Interpersonal crimes such as aggravated assault greatly impacts upon an individuals’ sense of personal safety and security as the crime results in a physical injury. Understanding where and when aggravated assaults are most likely to occur is therefore vital to minimize the victimization risk associated with this crime. The main aim of this study is to explore the relative importance of space and time in aggravated assault victimization. This was done using national level aggravated assault data (2008-2010) obtained from New Zealand Police and census data from Statistics New Zealand. Both the spatial and temporal distribution of aggravated assault are outlined to examine their association with aggravated assault victimization. Aggravated assault is found to cluster in space but not in time. The relationships between aggravated assault risk in space and time and a suite of social, economic, and lifestyle variables was then examined. A clear socioeconomic gradient was found between aggravated assault risk by space and all neighborhood characteristics with high-risk neighborhoods having greater residential mobility and ethnic/racial diversity, as well as being more deprived, having higher rates of unemployment, and lower median household incomes. No clear pattern emerged between aggravated assault by time and the selected neighborhood characteristics. The policy implications of these findings in terms of policing and diversity conclude. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The rapid escalation of smartphones and online transactions increases the rate of phishing attacks that exploit the user credentials for fraudulent financial gains. The existing detection methods suffer from low detection accuracy and high false positive rate (FPR). In this study, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) with a novel training algorithm is used for detecting phishing attacks. A novel fuzzy dense K-modes (FDKM) clustering algorithm is proposed for obtaining the Gaussian kernels in pattern layer. Moreover, the proposed optimisation procedure called modified harmony search with generation regrouping (MHS GR) finds the optimal smoothing parameter for training the network. The proposed approach was evaluated on benchmark phishing datasets obtained from UCI machine learning repository and on our Phish Net dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed PNN with MHS GR (PNN HS3) obtained 98.53%, 96.92%, and 97.12% of detection accuracy and 2.02%, 3.39%, and 3.12% of FPR for UCI 1, UCI 2, and Phish Net dataset respectively.

AB  - Objectives: To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars’ choice of residence to burglarize. Methods: We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars’ target choice in a conditional logit model. Results: Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions: Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars’ target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Using personal trajectory information to grasp the spatiotemporal laws of dangerous activities to curb the occurrence of criminal acts is a new opportunity and method for security prevention and control. This paper proposes a novel method to discover abnormal behaviors and judge abnormal behavior patterns using mobility trajectory data. Abnormal behavior trajectory refers to the behavior trajectory whose temporal and spatial characteristics are different from normal behavior, and it is an important clue to discover dangerous behavior. Abnormal patterns are the behavior patterns summarized based on the regular characteristics of criminals’ activities, including wandering, scouting, random walk, and trailing. This paper examines the abnormal behavior patterns based on mobility trajectories. A Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)-based method is used to extract personal trajectory features, and the K-means clustering method is applied to extract abnormal trajectories from the trajectory dataset. Based on the characteristics of different abnormal behaviors, the spatio-temporal feature matching method is used to identify the abnormal patterns based on the filtered abnormal trajectories. Experimental results showed that the trajectory-based abnormal behavior discovery method can realize a rapid discovery of abnormal trajectories and effective judgment of abnormal behavior patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, particularly those who have experienced criminal justice involvement, have particularly high HIV burdens, and a majority of those in jail have substance use disorders (SUDs). MSM and transgender women also experience elevated rates of incarceration. Once community re-entry occurs, individuals are in a critical period for addressing potential risks of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition and negative sequelae of substance use. Further, the impact experienced by one's social and sexual networks experienced at the time of detention and release have important health implications for MSM and transgender women. Objective: The purpose of this study is to test a new intervention-Mobile-Enhanced Prevention Support (MEPS)-that involves a GPS-based mobile app called GeoPassport (referred to as GeoPass in practice), incentives, and peer support for promoting HIV prevention, substance use treatment, and use of related services. Methods: A two-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial will seek to enroll 300 HIV-negative MSM and transgender women, aged 18-49 years, with SUDs, who are either in jail or have recently left jail. Participants will be enrolled by study staff and randomized to the MEPS intervention group or usual care group. The intervention group will receive customized wellness goals in addition to GeoPass, cash incentives, and the support of a trained peer mentor for 6 months. Data collection will consist of a baseline survey and three follow-up surveys at 3, 6, and 9 months postenrollment, either in person or by phone or videoconference when necessary. The primary outcomes include establishing a primary care provider; being prescribed and adhering to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV; screening for HIV, STIs, and hepatitis C virus; and engagement in recommended treatment for SUDs. Secondary outcomes include obtaining treatment for any identified infections and avoiding recidivism. Results: Enrollment began in November 2019 and study completion is expected in 2023. Conclusions: This study will advance our knowledge base on patient navigation and peer mentor interventions. Peer navigation services have been studied for the treatment of HIV, but less often in the context of HIV and STI prevention among sexual and gender minority populations at the time of re-entry into the community from jail. The MEPS study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of combining peer mentor services with a mobile app to facilitate service utilization and participant-peer mentor communication. MEPS will assess patterns of PrEP uptake and utilization in MSM and transgender women leaving jail. The study will provide heretofore unavailable data from persons leaving jail regarding HIV PrEP, STI screening, substance abuse treatment, and service utilization patterns and experiences, including geocoded data for those in the intervention arm. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Analyzing network traffic data to detect suspicious network activities requires tremendous efforts because of continuously changing network traffic patterns and intrusion scenarios. Numerous research has been devoted to the task of identifying network anomalies while maintaining excellent performances. However, most studies focus on identifying network attacks without considering their temporal domain. Time information is useful for discovering patterns in network activities and understanding the changes in network traffic over time. This paper introduces an approach to discover network traffic patterns with time series analysis to estimate the level of attack risks. Classification is performed with machine learning techniques to assess the estimated attack risks. Findings from this study can increase the capability to detect network intrusions by analyzing the behaviors of temporal data and estimating their attack risks. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Image retrieval of tire tread pattern plays a vital role in traffic accidents and criminal investigation. We propose a tire pattern retrieval method based on wavelet transform and Siamese network, which combine traditional techniques with deep learning. Firstly, we use the wavelet transform to extract low-level features of tire patterns. Secondly, we design a lightweight network called TireNet to extract high-level features of tire patterns. The TireNet based on MobileNet V1 replace the single convolutional neural network of the original Siamese network. Finally, the low-level and high-level features are fused to generate a one-dimensional vector, and calculated the similarity by Euclidean distance. To verify the proposed method in this article, we construct a tire pattern dataset named TireDataset. The experimental results show that the Siamese network is feasible in the task of learning the similarity of tire patterns, and TireNet outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy trade-off. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL), which links trajectories to users, is a recently introduced trajectory mining task with a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from personalized recommendation systems and location-based social networks to potential criminals identification. Previous approaches on solving the TUL task generally rely on classic models or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. However, their prediction accuracy is always not satisfactory due to the following reasons: 1) trajectory data is low-sampling and sparse; 2) user mobility patterns are high-order and multi-periodic; and 3) previous approaches fail to utilize existing abundant features. In this paper, we propose DeepTUL, which is composed of a feature representation layer and a recurrent network with attention mechanism, to solve TUL task. DeepTUL not only combines multiple features that govern user mobility to model high-order and complex mobility patterns, but also learns from labeled historical trajectory to capture multi-periodic nature of user mobility and alleviate the data sparsity problem. Extensive experiments show that DeepTUL yields significant improvements over the existing methods on two types of real-life mobility datasets (i.e., check-in dataset and WLAN dataset). Moreover, DeepTUL provides intuitive interpretation into the trajectory-user linking. © 2020 International Foundation for Autonomous.

AB  - In the spatial analysis of crime, the residential population has been a conventional measure of the population at risk. Recent studies suggest that the ambient population is a useful alternative measure of the population at risk that can better capture the activity patterns of a population. However, current studies are limited by the availability of high precision demographic characteristics, such as social activities and the origins of residents. In this research, we use spatially referenced mobile phone data to measure the size and activity patterns of various types of ambient population, and further investigate the link between urban larceny-theft and population with multiple demographic and activity characteristics. A series of crime attractors, generators, and detractors are also considered in the analysis to account for the spatial variation of crime opportunities. The major findings based on a negative binomial model are three-fold. (1) The size of the non-local population and people's social regularity calculated from mobile phone big data significantly correlate with the spatial variation of larceny-theft. (2) Crime attractors, generators, and detractors, measured by five types of Points of Interest (POIs), significantly depict the criminality of places and impact opportunities for crime. (3) Higher levels of nighttime light are associated with increased levels of larceny-theft. The results have practical implications for linking the ambient population to crime, and the insights are informative for several theories of crime and crime prevention efforts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Telephony technologies (mobile, VoIP, and fixed) have potentially improved the way we communicate in our daily life and have been widely adopted for business and personal communications. At the same time, scammers, criminals, and fraudsters have also find the telephony network an attractive and affordable medium to target end-users with the advertisement, marketing of legal and illegal products, and bombard them with the huge volume of unwanted calls. These calls would not only trick call recipients into disclosing their private information such as credit card numbers, PIN code which can be used for financial fraud but also causes a lot of displeasure because of continuous ringing. The fraudsters, political campaigners can also use telephony systems to spread malicious information (hate political or religious messages) in real-time through audio or text messages, which have serious political and social consequences if malicious callers are not mitigated in a quick time. In this context, the identification of malicious callers would not only minimize telephony fraud but would also bring peace to the lives of individuals. One way to classifies users as a spammer or legitimate is to get feedback from the call recipients about their recent interactions with the caller, but these systems not only bring inconvenience to callees but also require changes in the system design. The call detail records extensively log the activities of users and can be used to categorize them as the spammer and non-spammer. In this paper, we utilize the information from the call detailed records and proposed a spam detection framework for the telephone network that identifies malicious callers by utilizing the social behavioral features of users within the network. To this extent, we first model the behavior of the users as the directed social graph and then analyze different features of the social graph i.e. the Relationship Network and Call patterns of users towards their peers. We then used these features along with the decision tree to classify callers into three classes i.e. human, spammer and call center. We analyzed the call record data-set consisting of more than 2 million users. We have conducted a detailed evaluation of our framework which demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving acceptable detection accuracy and extremely low false-positive rate. The performance results show that the spammers and call center numbers not only have a large number of non-repetitive calls but also have a large number of short duration calls. Similarly, on the other hand, the legitimate callers have a good number of repetitive calls and most of them interacted for a relatively long duration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities, transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies, emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Advances in both telecommunications and Information technology have improved the way users do business online. Android, an open-source mobile operating system, is becoming an attractive target for cyber criminals to exploit due to its predefined permission model. Without classification, the mobile operating system permits installation of mobile applications of all kinds, including Trojans, thus making its trustworthiness into question. In this paper, we present a security system called collaborative policy-based security scheme (CSS) that permits users to customize the access permissions of Android applications during runtime. The proposed CSS security scheme validates the trustworthiness of each application before being installed. The experimental results show that the proposed CSS successfully detects all malicious applications with a run-time overhead of 2.7%. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Face spoofing is an attack attempt to obtain unauthorized access by using photos, videos, or 3D maps of a user’s face. The development of anti-spoofing strategies evolves at the same time as facial authentication technologies. Many methods for preventing such attacks have been proposed recently [1–3], showing excellent results accuracy in fraud detection. However, most of these methods are very efficient in detecting patterns—such as fraud—present a major disadvantage: a high computational cost. This cost directly impacts the user experience of the facial authentication system, since the spoofing verification adds an extra layer of inference by artificial intelligence models, causing a longer waiting time for the authentication system’s user. This impact is most noted when the inference is performed on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile, tablets, and edge devices. In this work, we carry out an experimental analysis of the common anti-spoofing strategies considering the trade-off between correctness fraud detection and computational cost, aimed at optimizing the user experience. We also propose to use a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a base network trained on a larger dataset and adds to our analysis. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Due to the ever-increasing demand for developing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that support low power consumption and high-performance mobile computing, several power optimization techniques have been implemented and deployed at the processors level, especially the ARM Cortex-M family chipsets. Such techniques include clock gating, power gating, dynamic voltage, and frequency scaling. Although such mechanisms help in minimizing dynamic power consumption by shutting off current to blocks or chip-operational units that are not in use, power gating and clock-gating techniques can be exploited by an attacker to disable blocks within the chipset targeting the subsystem availabilities. Attacks include disabling serial communication blocks, wireless/ethernet communication modules, Random Number Generator (RNG) block, interrupt module, etc. This paper proposed the development of a live clock-gating assisted malware attack for IoT systems based on the ARM Cortex-M processor. Four variants of the proposed malware were codded and deployed on a real IoT testbed integrated with a multisensor data fusion algorithm. Behavioral patterns based on power spectral density estimations and current measurements were recorded for each strain of the proposed malware. In this research, collected behavioral patterns were utilized to identify an infected device and its injected malware strain. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - While Eastern European migration is predominantly seen as one-way, permanent, for economic reasons, and as going bilaterally from East to West Europe, this book investigates alternative patterns of migration and mobility across Europe. This original new book explores how visual artists take part in regular cross-border mobilities, onward migrations and transnational communications across Europe for work and the effects of this on their feelings of home and belonging. It assesses how far there is a culture of mobility amongst visual artists from the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, for whom a combination of onward migration and regular cross-border mobilities is a necessity for career progression. This is due to the ‘glass ceiling’ in the Baltic States with regard to a lack of local art markets, few dealers buying art and governments not providing enough funding. How then do artists from the Baltic States get onto the global art market in the face of such barriers? This is a particularly important question, as these artists come from a region where migration, mobilities and cross-cultural exchanges were not freely available during the Soviet Union. This transdisciplinary investigation into visual artists’ working practices, ways of moving and placing dwellings addresses this issue. Mobile working practices have an impact on artists’ feelings of home and belonging, which can be seen in their artworks that compare different cultures. This is a result of their particular combination of onward migration and regular mobilities, the multiple flows in and out of the home cities and the workings of the global art market within which these artists are operating. Nevertheless, these movements are determined by the forces of the global art world, whereby a particular politics of migration and mobility is experienced by artists from the Baltic States wanting to ‘make it’ in the global art world. With its focus on Baltic artists and their mobilities, the scope and space explored is the whole of Europe and the mobilities explored in this text are crucially enabled by the freedom of movement in the European Union. The book is multidisciplinary and at the intersection of art, geographic mobility and creative practice. It combines visual cultures and social sciences in order to answer questions more thoroughly as well as to contextualise an analysis of artworks in a conversation with the artists themselves. This topic is current, with the situation of the ‘refugee crisis’ and Brexit that has created a culture of anti-immigration and resurgence in anti-Eastern European sentiment in government, mainstream media and society. The book discusses the implications of these complex itineraries on the conventional sociological notions of home, mobility and diaspora. The author argues that artists form a ‘diaspora of practice’ rather than of ethnicity, their homes are multiple as are the directions of their settlement. Primary appeal will be to artists and art professionals; scholars working and researching on mobilities and migration issues; those working on the concepts of belonging and home; sociologists; anthropologists; those in the fields of cultural studies and European Union studies. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - This open access book explores how biometric data is increasingly flowing across borders in order to limit, control and contain the mobility of selected people, namely criminalized populations. It introduces the concept of bio-bordering, using it to capture reverse patterns of bordering and ordering practices linked to transnational biometric data exchange regimes. The concept is useful to reconstruct how the territorial foundations of national state autonomy are partially reclaimed and, at the same time, partially purposefully suspended. The book focuses on the Prüm system, which facilitates the mandatory exchange of forensic DNA data amongst EU Member States. The Prüm system is an underexplored phenomenon, representing diverse instances of bio-bordering and providing a complex picture of the hidden (dis)integration of Europe. Particular legal, scientific, technical and political dimensions related to the governance and uses of biometric technologies in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom are specifically explored to demonstrate both similar and distinct patterns. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - With the increasing utilization of the Internet and its provided services, an increase in cyber-attacks to exploit the information occurs. A technology to store and maintain user's information that is mostly used for its simplicity and low-cost services is cloud computing (CC). Also, a new model of computing that is noteworthy today is mobile cloud computing (MCC) that is used to reduce the limitations of mobile devices by allowing them to offload certain computations to the remote cloud. The cloud environment may consist of critical or essential information of an organization; therefore, to prevent this environment from possible attacks a security solution is needed. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a solution to these security issues. An IDS is a hardware or software device that can examine all inside and outside network activities and recognize doubtful patterns that may demonstrate a network attack and automatically alert the network (or system) administrator. Because of the ability of an IDS to detect known/unknown (inside/outside) attacks, it is an excellent choice for securing cloud computing. Various methods are used in an intrusion detection system to recognize attacks more accurately. Unlike survey papers presented so far, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of intrusion detection systems that use computational intelligence (CI) methods in a (mobile) cloud environment. We firstly provide an overview of CC and MCC paradigms and service models, also reviewing security threats in these contexts. Previous literature is critically surveyed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of previous work. Then we define a taxonomy for IDS and classify CI-based techniques into single and hybrid methods. Finally, we highlight open issues and future directions for research on this topic. © 2020

AB  - Advances in technology have provided substantial benefits and innovations to the world in massive ways such as ecommerce, timely business processing, connectivity, easy access to information and fast communication. Such benefits and innovations have been adopted in the banking sector, for example, mobile banking, credit cards, Internet banking as well as agency banking. Although information technology has provided substantial benefits mentioned above it, however, comes with disadvantages such as information security breaches and unsecure Information and Communication Technology environments. As a result, end-users are now connected to the Internet, and this has resulted in several internet users becoming victims of cybercriminals. This study aimed at evaluating patterns of cybercrimes associated with online transactions in the Namibian banking institutions' cyberspace and proposes mitigation strategies. To do that, the researcher interviewed six Namibian banking institutions to understand cybersecurity issues, trends and existing solutions. The study found that cybercrimes such as phishing, social engineering, vishing, smishing, spear phishing, spoofing and website compromise, distributed denial-of-service (DDos) are rampant. This is worsened by the fact that Namibia does not have a local cybersecurity framework to guide local banks in curbing these crimes.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Though past research has examined the influence of social stress exposure on the mental health of older African Americans, the tendency is to investigate singular stress exposures (e.g., discrimination). Furthermore, this research rarely assesses whether the psychological effects of specific stress exposures are genderspecific. The current study fills these gaps by ascertaining (a) gendered patterns of stress exposure among older African Americans, and (b) gendered nuances in the individual, collective, and cumulative effects of stress exposure on mental health. Using the National Survey of American of Life (N = 992; 614 women, 378 men), the study utilizes a sample of African American-identified women and men, 50 years of age and older. Study results revealed that gender patterns of stress exposure were dependent on the stress measure under investigation. In addition, women and men shared some stress predictors of mental health (e.g., everyday discrimination); nevertheless, other stress predictors were specific to women (e.g., health-related mobility challenges) while others were unique to men (e.g., perceived neighborhood crime). Study findings challenge gerontologists to engage how racial and gendered identities intersect to place race-gender groups at distinct risks for stressors that elicit poor mental health. Study results have implications for the development of tailored strategies for improving the psychological health of African American women and men in mid to late life. © 2022 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.

AB  - Environmental and land defenders play a crucial role in attempts to slow down environmental change and address power inequalities in land-use and resource development. Yet, they frequently face repression, including defamation, criminalization, and assassination. Recent policy and media coverage initiatives have provided much needed attention to the protection and support of defenders, but there has so far been little systematic analysis of patterns and determinants of repression at multiple scales. Here, we use databases providing the best available worldwide record of cases of socio-environmental conflicts and killings of defenders to identify patterns of repression and potential determinants of killings. Globally, about a third of socio-environmental conflicts involve mass mobilization, arrests and direct forms of violence. These ‘high intensity’ conflicts are more frequent in Asia and Latin America. At least 1734 killings of environmental and land defenders took place in a total of 53 countries between 2002 and 2018, most of them occurring in Brazil, the Philippines, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Peru. Our multivariate analysis indicates that major country-level determinants of killings include income level, foreign direct investment, dependency on mineral extraction, regime type, frequency of protest movements, and size of Indigenous populations. We suggest that more systematic reporting and analysis of repression – including through subnational level studies for which we provide testable hypotheses – can help protect and support defenders, notably through conflict-sensitive investment policies and greater accountability for abuses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Technology has brought great benefits to human beings and has served to improve the quality of life and carry out great discoveries. However, its use can also involve many risks. Examples include mobile devices, digital cameras and video surveillance cameras, which offer excellent performance and generate a large number of images and video. These files are generally shared on social platforms and are exposed to any manipulation, compromising their authenticity and integrity. In a legal process, a manipulated video can provide the necessary elements to accuse an innocent person of a crime or to exempt a guilty person from criminal acts. Therefore, it is essential to create robust forensic methods, which will strengthen the justice administration systems and thus make fair decisions. This paper presents a novel forensic technique to detect the post-processing of digital videos with MP4, MOV and 3GP formats. Concretely, detect the social platform and editing program used to execute possible manipulation attacks. The proposed method is focused on supervised machine learning techniques. To achieve our goal, we take advantage that the social platforms and editing programs, execute filtering and compression processes on the videos when they are shared or manipulated. The result of these transformations leaves a characteristic pattern in the videos that allow us to detect the social platform or editing program efficiently. Three phases are involved in the method: 1) Dataset preparation; 2) data features extraction; 3) Supervised model creation. To evaluate the scalability of the technique in real scenarios, we used a robust, heterogeneous and far superior dataset than that used in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work identifies and analyzes characteristics of the census sections of Sao Paulo's capital, grouping them in eight different patterns. In order to separate these areas into clusters (segments) representing intragroup homogeneity, variables were selected that take into account the conditions and changes of the population, environment, crime rates, housing, mobility and urban expansion. Each of these clusters (segments) portrays a different demographic profile and urban pattern. Thus, it is proposed that clustering these similar groups (i.e., reducing intragroup variance/variation and maximizing the intergroup variance/variation) enables a better understanding of the city's singularities and of what these singularities entail. Furthermore, an inter-and transdisciplinary perspective highlights the need to adjust the sampling, data collection and valuation strategies, as well as the identification, description, and study of Sao Paulo's capital. © 2019 Instituto de Estudos Avancados da Universidade de Sao Paulo.

AB  - Nowadays people save a lot of privacy information in mobile devices. These information can be theft by adversaries through suspicious apps installed in smartphones, and protecting users’ privacy has become a great challenge. So developing a method to identify if there are apps thieving users’ personal information in smartphones is important and necessary. Through the analysis of apps’ network traffic data, we observe that general apps generate regular network flows with the users’ normal operations. But information theft apps’ network flows have no relationship with users’ operations. In this paper we propose a model MUI-defender (Mobile Users’ Information defender), which is based on analyzing the relationship between users’ operation patterns and network flows with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), can efficiently detect information theft. Because of C&C (Command-and-Control) server invalidation [33] and system version incompatibility [25], etc., most of the collected information theft apps can’t run properly in reality. So we extract information theft code modules from some of these apps, and then recode and compile them into the ITM-capsule (Information Theft Modules capsule) for verification. Finally, we run the ITM-capsule and several normal apps to detect the network flows, which shows our detection model can achieve an accuracy higher than 94%. Therefore, MUI-defender is suitable for detecting the network flows of information theft. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - The ability of modern smartphones to provide us with real time location-based data is one of its most important features. Being able to predict a person's future location based on the real time location data would be the next step in utilizing this functionality. Using this functionality, combined with machine learning one's probable destination can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy. People don't always use map-based navigation for the places they visit every day, like their work place or school and there may be significant traffic on the regular route taken, however, if our device knows where we're headed, it can warn us beforehand and help us reroute. This functionality can also be used by cops to determine the future location of a criminal fleeing a crime scene.These features and functionalities can be implemented through various machine learning algorithms which are compared to determine the most accurate one. The proposed system can predict a user's future location using the current location and time, learning from the user's previously visited locations. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Injection attacks are at the top of Open Web Application Security Project's Top 10 Application Security Risks list almost every year. SQL Injection (SQLI) is one such attack that presents the adversaries an opportunity to access personally identifiable information and commit identity theft, putting breach victims at risk. An intrusion detection and prevention system is a system or software application that continuously monitors a network for possible malicious activity or policy violations. A signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) relies on predefined signatures to detect an attack. The signatures used are usually released periodically by the company who owns the IDS software or by the admin. Writing these signatures manually or waiting on the releases of new rules can take up significant time, effort, and knowledge. In this paper, we develop a system that monitors traffic in real time, performs deep packet inspection on each incoming packet, and looks for possible SQLI patterns to form rules in Snort (IDS) database. Our method increases the baseline IDS performance by 4.7x, with only 23% of the resources required by the baseline, while performing in the order of a few milliseconds, suitable for real-time edge networks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - With the developments of the mobile devices and Internet of things, the location data have recorded amount of information about people activities. Mining the hot spots from the location-based data and studying the changing patterns of hot spots are useful to the early warnings of the disasters, traffic jams and crimes. Current researches on hot spots detections ignore the temporal factors. In this paper, the data field method is used to describe the interactions of spots, and the temporal factors are incorporated into the data field method. Furthermore, a hot spots detection method is proposed. Finally, the heat map is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on an open dataset. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Psychopathy is characterized by a lack of empathy, callousness, and a range of severe antisocial behaviors. A deficit to accurately process social cues, which has been widely documented in psychopathic populations, is assumed to underlie their pathological development. Impaired attention to socially salient cues, such as the eyes of an interaction partner, is a possible mechanism compromising the development of social cognition. Preliminary evidence from static facial stimuli suggests that psychopathy is indeed linked to reduced eye gaze. However, no study to date has investigated whether these mechanisms apply to naturalistic interactions. This study is the first to examine patterns of visual attention during live social interactions and their association with symptom clusters of psychopathy. Eye contact was assessed in a sample of incarcerated offenders (N = 30) during semistructured face-to-face interactions with a mobile eye-tracking headset and analyzed using a novel automated areas of interest (e.g., eye region) labeling technique. The interactions included an exchange on neutral predetermined topics and included a condition in which the participants were active (talking) and passive (listening). The data reveal that across both listening and talking conditions higher affective psychopathy is a significant predictor of reduced eye contact (listening: r = −.39; talking: r = −.43). The present findings are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy. This study is the first to document these deficits in naturalistic, live social interaction and therefore provides important evidence for their relevance to real-life behavior.

AB  - The article discusses the role of external challenges (military-political pressure and demonstration effect) in modernization of societies from the perspective of asynchronous global development. According to this research, interstate and inter-regional imbalances and disparities are the “birthmark” of world history. Disparities of development create tensions between and among countries resultant of conflicts between national governments. Comparing the concepts of “challenge-and-response” by A.J. Toynbee and “economic superiority” (“economic primacy”) by C. Kindleberger, the author suggests the idea of “avant-garde society”, i.e. society programming the basic parameters of modernization of the “catching up” peoples. “Later take-off” societies – Germany, Japan and Italy, to name just a few, – mobilized domestic resources like savings ratios, literacy, indigenous technologies, social capital and even ideology to compete on equal footing with pioneers of industrialization. The “later take-off” societies, Germany in particular, proved so efficient to join the league of the most advanced nations. The net economic impact of state intervention was vivid where markets were well-developed. State-centered mode of the “guided capitalism” was instrumental of upgrading Germany to the rank of the leading economic power, second only to the United States of America. Nowadays, with the collapse of the Soviet-American bipolarity and the subsequent disintegration of Pax Americana, the geopolitical structure of the modern world is becoming more composite, whilst the desire to attain the “avant-garde society” status forms a complex polymorphic architecture of a constantly changing oecumen/human space. In the new, tightening world, the external challenge factor is of central importance. Economy and geopolitics, therefore, predetermine a country’s ability to move to the position of the “avant-garde society”. In this constant motion, within the world political hierarchy, a prominent role belongs to the factors of physical geography, more specifically: to the peculiarities of interaction between the nature and society, which often require the people to act in a “challenge-and-response” pattern. © 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Detecting pickpocketing gangs on buses is critical for safety and public security department. Knowing this both in real time and from historical records would allow effective law enforcement and crime prevention. However, very little research has been devoted into identifying pickpocketing gangs in an automated and holistic manner. This research utilizes smart card data generated by bus riders to identify pickpocketing gangs, who possess distinct characteristics from regular passengers. Particularly, we create a dataset of 1,098 pickpockets among 4.06 million bus riders in August, 2015 in Beijing automatically and efficiently based on an efficient labeling model of outliers. This model examines anomaly of passengers using the so-called relative outlier cluster factor and local outlier factor. The proposed mobility patterns of pickpockets are then learned based on supervised classification. Pickpockets from the derived dataset form a pickpocketing network, which is modeled as a graph with vertices denoted as discrete pickpockets, and edge weight quantified by a combined similarity on mobility pattern, space and time. A graphbased Louvain algorithm is adopted to detect pickpocketing gangs. Experiments are conducted on SINA microblog data to verify the detected pickpocketing gangs identified by the proposed framework. Results show that the framework detects 63 pickpocketing gangs and verifies 34 gangs by microblogs, with recall value 0.85. Findings from this research can assist police and public safety departments in the city in taking pro-active actions to track down pickpocketing gangs. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Aim: Developing a theory explaining how public health nurses accomplish and adapt counselling in lifestyle habits to decrease obesity in people with mobility disability. Design: Empirical research - qualitative. Method: Classic grounded theory with face-to-face interviews, 2017–2018, using inductive approach to understand public health nurses' intervening experiences with obesity patients. Results: To initiate the conversation emerged as the main concern meaning having difficulties initiating conversations about obesity with patients. Public health nurses’ facilitators to communicate lifestyle changes emerged as the pattern generating the theory, which consists of the categories; person-centeredness in the situation, experience and knowledge, strengthening conditions, access to other professionals and prioritization in everyday work. Conclusions: Public health nurses hesitate to raise topics of obesity in patients with mobility disability. They advocate increased integration with lifestyle changes in everyday work including multi-professional cooperation. The implication is testing the emerged theory at primary health care centres. Impact: Obesity is more common in people with mobility disability than in those without. There is a need to understand how public health nurses adapt counselling in lifestyle habits. Public health nurses hesitate to talk about obesity with patients in fear of offending anyone. Public health nurses did not distinguish between patients with or without mobility disability. Several facilitators could be helpful initiating conversation with the patients. Public health nurses need more time and resources to facilitate conversation with patients with mobility disability to counsel lifestyle changes. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Telecommunication sector is one of the technologically advanced sectors, globally. The mobile device market is always growing and it is very competitive. Counterfeit and substandard devices are collectively known as black market devices. Availability of black market and stolen mobile devices is a global issue. When buying a mobile device, most of the people focus on cost, brand and model. The important factors that represent the standard of mobile devices such as validity of International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value are neglected. It is important to adhere to a proper policy framework and introduce systems such as Equipment Identity Registers (EIRs) to minimize the usage of black market and stolen mobile communication devices. Mobile device blocking and regulation have become difficult tasks due to the unavailability of proper systems and policies. This has allowed stolen and black market mobile device usage. As per the user survey conclusions, it was identified that user behavior patterns, limitations of existing EIR and prevailing policies should be changed to address the issue. A policy framework that includes the steps of increasing user awareness, establishing a proper blocking mechanism and adding reforms to regulations is recommended as a solution. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The World Economic Forum notes that there is an economic gap between Indonesia and Malaysia every year as seen from GDP per capita. The economic disparity between the two countries caused differences in available employment opportunities. Limited employment opportunities in Indonesia cause an increase in unemployment in Indonesia. The high unemployment rate in West Kalimantan is the main cause of the migration of Indonesians to Malaysia with the aim of carrying out economic and trade activities in the Serikin Market which is located in Sarawak, East Malaysia. The market only takes about 15 minutes from the Jagoi Babang. This study used primary data collected by using in-depth interview and observation techniques which was analyzed qualitatively. The study found that in general the migration patterns of Indonesian traders who traded in the Serikin Market practiced non-permanent mobility patterns. The opportunities of cross-border trade carried out by Indonesian traders are reducing unemployment, facilitating product marketing, increasing income. While the challenges faced are the inadequacy of the road infrastructure, the quality of merchandise that is not good, the unavailability of lodging for Indonesian traders in the border area of Jagoi Babang, shop rental prices are relatively expensive. Basically, this research is to provide empirical data regarding to opportunities and challenges of cross-border traders that will be able to be used for future research related to strategies in managing cross-border trade Hopefully, this research will contribute significantly to generate an effective migration policy in order to minimize transnational crimes. © 2020 AJHTL.

AB  - This chapter addresses the ability of the criminological approaches that comprise Environmental Criminology to constitute an adequate theoretical framework to analyze and understand the situational aspects of crimes committed through cyberspace and to define the most appropriate prevention strategies. The chapter begins by examining how these approaches have been applied. Subsequently, the reasons why the environmental approach can offer much more in this area if some apparent obstacles are overcome are presented. Finally, a method of applying these midrange theoretical frameworks to different cybercrimes is proposed. Relying on multiple empirical studies, it is stated that the essential premise of the environmental approach is also observed in cybercrime: the existence of situational patterns. These patterns are derived from the different ways in which offenders and targets, in the absence of guardians, converge in cyber places: digital interaction environments that shape the situational opportunities in which people interact. The chapter ends by summarizing the application possibilities of approaches such as the Crime Pattern Theory and Situational Crime Prevention in connection with the Routine Activity Theory and the Rational Choice Theory. It is proposed that many of the geographical applications derived from these approaches and some of their basic theoretical premises need to be adapted while seeking to enhance their strengths and mitigate the effects of their weaknesses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Informed by the growing third-person effect research of social and online media, the present study examines the perceived negative impact of increasing mobile Internet fraud on user's social ties and their likely response to cope with the rising fraud. A probability sample of 816 respondents in China was used in collecting data regarding the beliefs of their own and other's vulnerability to fraud online. Key findings show that their negative perceptions of mobile Internet fraud vary significantly by the strength of their social relationships and network homogeneity—the closer the ties, the greater perceived vulnerability to mobile Internet fraud; the more homogenous their social networks, the more pronounced the pattern. In addition, awareness of the fraud was found to enhance the self-other perceptual gap. Finally, the perceived negative impact of the fraud on self leads to protective actions in terms of verifying suspicious messages. On the other hand, the negatively perceived impact on weak ties is related to staying alert and reducing the use of mobile Internet, suggesting that respondents viewed fraud victims in their social network as warnings. © 2019

AB  - Human mobility has a significant impact on several layers of society, from infrastructural planning and economics to the spread of diseases and crime. Representing the system as a complex network, in which nodes are assigned to regions (e.g., a city) and links indicate the flow of people between two of them, physics-inspired models have been proposed to quantify the number of people migrating from one city to the other. Despite the advances made by these models, our ability to predict the number of commuters and reconstruct mobility networks remains limited. Here, we propose an alternative approach using machine learning and 22 urban indicators to predict the flow of people and reconstruct the intercity commuters network. Our results reveal that predictions based on machine learning algorithms and urban indicators can reconstruct the commuters network with 90.4% of accuracy and describe 77.6% of the variance observed in the flow of people between cities. We also identify essential features to recover the network structure and the urban indicators mostly related to commuting patterns. As previously reported, distance plays a significant role in commuting, but other indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate, are also driven-forces for people to commute. We believe that our results shed new lights on the modeling of migration and reinforce the role of urban indicators on commuting patterns. Also, because link-prediction and network reconstruction are still open challenges in network science, our results have implications in other areas, like economics, social sciences, and biology, where node attributes can give us information about the existence of links connecting entities in the network. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This article makes use of hourly crime counts to model the relationship between events that take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and robberies, an arena that has caused local controversy regarding the costs and benefits of hosting such an entertainment venue. Results from the econometric model suggest that the NHL’s New Jersey Devils ice hockey games, concerts, and Disney-themed events are all associated with increases in robbery, while various other event categories such as the NBA basketball games played by the Nets and boxing, and mixed martial arts (MMA) matches are not associated with an increase. These findings support two complementary ecological theories of crime that focus on how events provide additional opportunities for crime by increasing the associated benefits while simultaneously decreasing the cost for economically motivated offenders to take advantage of. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, a network intrusion detection system is proposed using Bayesian topic model latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for mobile edge computing (MEC). The method employs tcpdump packets and extracts multiple features from the packet headers. The tcpdump packets are transferred into documents based on the features. A topic model is trained using only attack-free traffic in order to learn the behavior patterns of normal traffic. Then, the test traffic is analyzed against the learned behavior patterns to measure the extent to which the test traffic resembles the normal traffic. A threshold is defined in the training phase as the minimum likelihood of a host. In the test phase, when a host's test traffic has a likelihood lower than the host's threshold, the traffic is labeled as an intrusion. The intrusion detection system is validated using DARPA 1999 dataset. Experiment shows that our method is suitable to protect the security of MEC.  © 2020 Xuefei Cao et al.

AB  - Examining the role of individual differences in perceptions of risk and rewards to offending has become an important line of inquire (Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, & Madensen, 2006); however, psychopathy has yet to be considered. We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending. © 2019

AB  - Background: For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geographical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns. Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013. Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern. Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces. Conclusions: Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, Android malicious samples threaten billions of mobile end users' security or privacy. The community researchers have designed many methods to automatically and accurately identify Android malware samples. However, the rapid increase of Android malicious samples outpowers the capabilities of traditional Android malware detectors and classifiers with respect to the cyber security risk management needs. It is important to identify the small proportion of Android malicious samples that may produce high cyber-security or privacy impact. In this paper, we propose a light-weight solution to automatically identify the Android malicious samples with high security and privacy impact. We manually check a number of Android malware families and corresponding security incidents and define two impact metrics for Android malicious samples. Our investigation results in a new Android malware dataset with impact ground truth (low impact or high impact). This new dataset is employed to empirically investigate the intrinsic characteristics of low-impact as well as high-impact malicious samples. To characterize and capture Android malicious samples' pattern, reverse engineering is performed to extract semantic features to represent malicious samples. The leveraged features are parsed from both the AndroidManifest.xml files as well as the disassembled binary classes.dex codes. Then, the extracted features are embedded into numerical vectors. Furthermore, we train highly accurate support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers to categorize the candidate Android malicious samples into low impact or high impact. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of our designed light-weight solution. This method can be further utilized for identifying those high-impact Android malicious samples in the wild. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In modern distributed systems, an adversary’s limitations when corrupting subsets of a system’s components (e.g., servers) may not necessarily be based on threshold constraints, but rather based on other technical or organizational characteristics. This means that the corruption patterns (and thus protection guarantees) are based on the adversary being limited by what can be captured by a General Adversary Structure (GAS). We consider efficient secure multiparty computation (MPC) under such dynamically-changing GAS settings. In such settings, one desires to protect against and during corruption profile changes; such adaptivity also renders some (secret sharing-based) encoding schemes underlying MPC protocols more efficient than others when operating with the (currently) considered GAS. One of our contributions is a set of new protocols to efficiently and securely convert back and forth between different MPC schemes for GAS; this process is often called share conversion. We consider two MPC schemes, one based on additive secret sharing and the other based on Monotone Span Programs (MSP). The ability to convert between the secret sharing representations of these MPC schemes enables us to construct the first communication-efficient structure-adaptive proactive MPC protocol for dynamic GAS settings. By structure-adaptive, we mean that the choice of the MPC protocol to execute in future rounds after the GAS is changed (as specified by an administrative entity) is chosen to ensure communication-efficiency (the typical bottleneck in MPC). Furthermore, since such secure “collaborative” computing may be long-lived, we consider the mobile adversary setting, often called the proactive security setting. As our second contribution, we construct communication-efficient MPC protocols that can adapt to the proactive security setting. Proactive security assumes that at each (well defined) period of time the adversary corrupts different parties and may visit the entire system overtime and corrupt all parties, provided that in each period it controls groups obeying the GAS constraints. In our protocol, the shares can be refreshed, meaning that parties receive new shares reconstructing the same secret, and some parties who lost their shares because of the reboot/reset can recover their shares. As our third contribution, we consider another aspect of global long-term computations, namely, that of the dynamic groups. Settings with dynamic groups and GAS were not dealt with in existing literature on (proactive) MPC. In dynamic group settings, parties can be added and eliminated from the computation, under different GAS restrictions. We extend our protocols to this additional dynamic group settings defined by different GAS (see the full version of the paper [18] for formal details of protocols and proofs). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Currently we are on the verge of the fourth industrial revolution with it fusion of technologies into so-called Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), especially in the industrial sector. Accompanied by this are modified requirements, such as interconnectivity, and new application scenarios, such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) or Machine-to-Service (M2S) communication. A major driving force in this development is the growth of interconnected devices towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, it is precisely the key enablers, such as mobility and flexibility, with the use of wireless communication solutions, that creates risks, attack vectors and cyber security threats. Depending on the open nature and the broadcast characteristic of the transmission type, it suffers a huge potential for miscellaneous cyberattacks. That is exactly why there is a great demand for the design of new communication systems for industrial applications that includes secure communication with doubtlessly authenticated entities. All other security services, such as confidentiality, integrity and reliability, are based on tamper-proof identification of all participating entities. Since conventional cryptography often comes along with a lot of overhead in form of complex computations as well as overhead in communication, both of which is not always suitable for small embedded devices and CPS applications, more lightweight security measures need to be introduced. In this work we suggest an approach based on the combination of different Physical Layer Security (PhySec) methods. PhySec comprises a series of technical procedures in which the generation of cryptographic credentials is based on different physical properties. We use the conditions and characteristics of the wireless channel to apply Secret Key Generation (SKG) methods. This enables key generation and key exchange in a one-step process. Furthermore, we utilize minimal deviations in the manufacturing process of semiconductors, such as impurities during the doping and different oxide layer thicknesses, to gain a chip individual bit pattern of SRAM-cells, so-called Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). These patterns, unique to each component, allow the use of cryptographic applications without the need to integrate external cryptographic material into the device. They are an inherently given and furthermore hard to forge opportunity to use security mechanisms. Our approach is a low cost, resource-saving and efficient alternative to conventional used cryptographic methods. It is a feasible way to enable confidence in IIoT systems. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019. All rights reserved.

AB  - Building on W. J. T. Mitchell’s (2012) insights on ‘race as a medium’ and a ‘framework of seeing through or seeing as,’ this essay argues that debates on Sudanese ‘criminal gangs’ in Melbourne, Australia; policies to counter alleged ‘radicalisation’ among Muslim youth in the UK; the continuing struggles for indigenous land rights; and rejections of asylum seekers almost everywhere in the West, attest to the operations of technologies of bureaucracy which, in turn, mobilise racially prejudiced systems of classification and patterns of misrecognition. Understanding the present conjuncture or the current crisis is integral to any politics opposing such classificatory systems and prejudicial ideologies. As Stuart Hall has reminded us, this involves taking into account ‘“relatively autonomous” sites—which have different origins, are driven by different contradictions, and develop according to their own temporalities’ which ‘are nevertheless “convened” or condensed in the same moment’ (Hall and Massey in Soundings 44: 38). Arguments over what constitutes the ‘real’ in these instances are not so much about ‘fake news’ as the ways in which images go ‘before’ the black immigrant, the Muslim youth, the asylum seeker, or the indigenous community in the form of abiding stereotypes that shape newer systems of misrecognition and misrepresentation. However, analysing the present conjuncture and the current crisis, of which such forms of misrecognition are emblematic, involves examining not just the ‘dominant’ or hegemonic but also, as Raymond Williams recommended (and John Clarke [2014] recently reiterated), considering the multiple temporalities and formations that together constitute the ‘emergent’ and the ‘residual.’ Using Policing the Crisis as a model, this essay draws on the recent work of W. J. T. Mitchell, Saskia Sassen, Patrick Wolfe, Arjun Appadurai and David Roediger to examine digital mediations/interventions by indigenous and refugee communities, recent protest movements, and the entanglements of race and class to argue that indigenous and refugee communities, along with the global poor, comprise the global subaltern. While the reasons for their current precarity and the various aspects that comprise their subaltern conditions may differ between these groups, the politics of ‘race,’ ethnicity and exclusion, and of representation and ‘voice,’ appear to impinge on both their material and their digital presence in similar ways. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Background Urban drug scenes are characterized by high prevalence of illicit drug dealing and use, violence and poverty, much of which is driven by the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) and the associated stigma. Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter ‘mobility’) among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD. Methods Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group. Results In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05). Conclusions Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES. © 2019 Hayashi et al.

AB  - This study explored geospatial technologies to support efforts of community organizations and of the Chicago Gun Violence Research Collaboration to reduce gun-related crimes. It entailed (1) identification of spatial trends in gun-related crimes during 2012 to 2017 in each of the following four areas: Austin, East Garfield, North Lawndale, and Englewood; (2) investigation of changes in crime patterns near safe school zones in the areas before and after the establishment of the city's safe passage routes in 2009 to protect the youth from street violence when traveling to school; and (3) development of a web-enabled mobile application to provide researchers and residents with spatial information on local crime incidents and to enable community members to collect and share their information in a GIS environment. The results of this research revealed that, although the number of safe passage routes has increased in these areas over the past several years, hotspot trends for gun-related crimes have intensified in most of the communities in these areas, which include school zones and safe passage routes. Accordingly, it turned out that GIS can serve as an ideal platform supporting collaborative efforts between communities and researchers. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Since the last decade of the twentieth century, several authors have claimed that the contemporary and ‘new’ developments in (private) policing and crime control form part of the process of neo-liberal policies and rational choice approaches to crime. However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Online mobile advertising plays a vital role in the mobile app ecosystem. The mobile advertising frauds caused by fraudulent clicks or other actions on advertisements are considered one of the most critical issues in mobile advertising systems. To combat the evolving mobile advertising frauds, machine learning methods have been successfully applied to identify advertising frauds in tabular data, distinguishing suspicious advertising fraud operation from normal one. However, such approaches may suffer from labor-intensive feature engineering and robustness of the detection algorithms, since the online advertising big data and complex fraudulent advertising actions generated by malicious codes, botnets, and click-firms are constantly changing. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted heterogeneous graph embedding and deep learning-based fraud detection approach, namely, GFD, to identify fraudulent apps for mobile advertising. In the proposed GFD approach, (i) we construct a weighted heterogeneous graph to represent behavior patterns between users, mobile apps, and mobile ads and design a weighted metapath to vector algorithm to learn node representations (graph-based features) from the graph; (ii) we use a time window based statistical analysis method to extract intrinsic features (attribute-based features) from the tabular sample data; (iii) we propose a hybrid neural network to fuse graph-based features and attribute-based features for classifying the fraudulent apps from normal apps. The GFD approach was applied on a large real-world mobile advertising dataset, and experiment results demonstrate that the approach significantly outperforms well-known learning methods.  © 2020 Jinlong Hu et al.

AB  - Having outperformed 5 billion human beings associated with mobile services in the year 2017, the worldwide mobile industry will achieve a significant stage at a higher level in the succeeding eight years. The quantity of distinctive versatile subscribers will achieve 5.9 billion by 2025, proportional to 71% of the total world's population. The Android operating system is the most broadly utilized smart phone operating system. Android operating system provides the subsequent category of security screen lock mechanism options namely pattern lock, PIN lock, password lock, etc. Pattern lock is a prevalent method to secure Android mobile phone as they are a considerable measure less demanding to recollect than PIN codes or passwords. Actually, around 40% of Android mobile phone proprietors decide on this lock technique which expects them to draw a confidential design on a grid of specks to ingress the device. Due to the expanded portability of the smart phones and its security features, users are storing their important personal information into the smart phones and In the meantime time the criminals can utilize Smartphone for various tasks. Namely perpetrate a criminal deception intended to result over email intimidation through text messages, drug trafficking, child erotica etc. If the mobile device is identified in a criminal activity and if it is locked then it is a challenge to the forensic investigator to bypass the screen lock. In this research paper we proposed a new CS (Chandrasekhar and Srinivas) pattern cracker algorithm, to crack the pattern lock of the Android mobile phone without data loss for forensic examination. The research methodology describes how to unbar the pattern lock. The experimental results shows how to unlock simple and hardest pattern locks by using the CS pattern cracker algorithm. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assesses the seasonal scheduling of shellfish harvesting among hunter-gatherer populations along the southernmost coast of South Africa, based on a large number of serial oxygen isotope analyses of marine mollusk shells from four archaeological sites. The south coast of South Africa boasts an exceptional record of coastal hunter-gatherer occupation spanning the Holocene, the last glacial cycle and beyond. The significance of coastal adaptations, in this region in particular, for later modern human evolution has been prominently debated. Shellfishing behaviors are an important focus for investigation given the dietary and scheduling implications and the abundant archaeological shell remains in numerous sites. Key to better understanding coastal foraging is whether it was limited to one particular season, or year-round. Yet, this has proven very difficult to establish by conventional archaeological methods. This study reconstructs seasonal harvesting patterns by calculating water temperatures from the final growth increment of shells. Results from two Later Stone Age sites, Nelson Bay Cave (together with the nearby Hoffman's Robberg Cave) and Byneskranskop 1, show a pronounced cool season signal, which is unexpected given previous ethnographic documentation of summer as the optimal season for shellfishing activities and inferences about hunter-gatherer scheduling and mobility in the late Holocene. Results from two Middle Stone Age sites, Klasies River and Pinnacle Point 5–6, show distinct seasonal patterns that likely reflect the seasonal availability of resources in the two locations. The Pinnacle Point 5–6 assemblage, which spans the MIS5-4 transition, records a marked shift in shellfishing seasonality at c. 71 ka that aligns with other indications of archaeological and environmental change at this time. We conclude that the scheduling and intensity of shellfishing in this region is affected by a suite of factors, including environmental and cultural drivers, rather than a single variable, such as population growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Every person using different online services is concerned with the security and privacy for protecting individual information from the intruders. Many authentication systems are available for the protection of individuals' data, and the password authentication system is one of them. Due to the increment of information sharing, internet popularization, electronic commerce transactions, and data transferring, both password security and authenticity have become an essential and necessary subject. But it is also mandatory to ensure the strength of the password. For that reason, all cyber experts recommend intricate password patterns. But most of the time, the users forget their passwords because of those complicated patterns. In this paper, we are proposing a unique algorithm that will generate a strong password, unlike other existing random password generators. This password will he based on the information, i.e. (some words and numbers) provided by the users so that they do not feel challenged to remember the password. We have tested our system through various experiments using synthetic input data. We also have checked our generator with four popular online password checkers to verify the strength of the produced passwords. Based on our experiments, the reliability of our generated passwords is entirely satisfactory. We also have examined that our generated passwords can defend against two password cracking attacks named the "Dictionary attack" and the "Brute Force attack". We have implemented our system in Python programming language. In the near future, we have a plan to extend our work by developing an online free to use user interface. The passwords generated by our system are not only user-friendly but also have achieved most of the qualities of being strong as well as non- crackable passwords. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Pioneered in Boston as part of its Operation Ceasefire strategy to halt serious youth violence in the 1990s, focused deterrence approaches (also known as “pulling levers” policing) have been embraced by police departments in the United States and other countries as an effective approach to crime prevention (Travis, 1998; Dalton, 2002; Deuchar, 2013). In its simplest form, the approach consists of selecting a particular crime problem, such as youth homicide; convening an interagency working group of law enforcement practitioners; conducting research to identify key offenders, groups, and behavior patterns; framing a response to offenders and groups of offenders that uses a varied menu of sanctions to stop them from continuing their violent behavior; focusing social services and community resources on targeted offenders and groups to match law enforcement prevention efforts; and directly and repeatedly communicating with offenders to make them understand why they are receiving this special attention (Kennedy, 1997; Kennedy, Chapter 9 in this volume). Although the goal of focused deterrence strategies is to prevent crime by changing offender perceptions of sanction risk, other complementary crime prevention mechanisms seem to support the crime control efficacy of these programs (Braga & Kennedy, 2012; Kennedy, Kleiman & Braga, 2017). These strategies are also intended to change offender behavior by mobilizing community action, enhancing procedural justice, and improving police legitimacy. © Cambridge University Press 2019.

AB  - Detection and recognition of a vehicle license plate is a fundamental requirement of any intelligent transport system, primarily to support activities like finding a stolen vehicle, vehicle surveillance/tracking, parking-toll collection, traffic flow planning and management, etc. However, a license plate can easily be stolen and/or changed by those with criminal intent to conceal their identity. This paper proposes a new vehicle identification system to obtain high degree of accuracy and success rate by not only considering the license plate but also shape of the vehicle. The proposed system is based on four steps: license plate detection, license plate recognition, license plate jurisdiction (province) detection and the vehicle shape detection. In the proposed system, the features are converted into local binary pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as training dataset. To obtain high degree of accuracy in real-time application, a novel method based on cascaded classifiers is used to update the system. The proposed system allows us to store features of vehicles and related information in the database, thus, allowing us to automatically detect any discrepancy between a license plate and vehicle associated with it.  © 2019 ACM.

AB  - Nowadays, police are facing with the challenge that crime increases far more rapidly than police force, which generate many problems and cause the police have to seek for support from new technical ways. In this background, the new concept of intelligence-led-policing was proposed. This concept indicated that police should actively identify and analyze the problems by collecting data, such that the potential threatens could be known in early stage and prevention resources would be deployed in more efficient ways. In this paper, a typical work big data analysis in policing was introduced. Pickpocketing offence is a kind of frequently occurred crime in public transportation, and identifying offenders is a great challenge for the police. With nearly a billion of metro subway traffic records accessed from Beijing metro line company, the passengers' routine mobility pattern was analyzed and some pickpocketing suspects were detected by defining some specific rules. The results indicated that significant traveling patterns exist for routine passengers, and some exceptional individuals who has the unique pattern which is quite different from routine passengers are discovered. However, the shortage of the work still exists as the identity of cardholders is anonymous and it cannot be confirmed, but it still provides an example of big data analysis in public security, which might inspire police for further work. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes a new technique to detect mobile malware based on information flow analysis. Our approach examines the structure of information flows to identify patterns of behavior present in them and which flows are related, those that share partial computation paths. We call such flows Complex-Flows, as their structure, patterns, and relations accurately capture the complex behavior exhibited by both recent malware and benign applications. N-gram analysis is used to identify unique and common behavioral patterns present in Complex-Flows. The N-gram analysis is performed on sequences of API calls that occur along Complex-Flows' control flow paths. We show the precision of our technique by applying it to four different data sets totaling 8,598 apps. These data sets consist of both recent and older generation benign and malicious apps to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different generations of apps. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Immigrants and natives are generally comparable in committing violent crimes in many Western cities. However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Identity theft through phishing and session hijacking attacks has become a major attack vector in recent years, and is expected to become more frequent due to the pervasive use of mobile devices. Continuous authentication based on the characterization of user behavior, both in terms of user interaction patterns and usage patterns, is emerging as an effective solution for mitigating identity theft, and could become an important component of defense-in-depth strategies in cyber-physical systems as well. In this paper, the interaction between an attacker and an operator using continuous authentication is modeled as a stochastic game. In the model, the attacker observes and learns the behavioral patterns of an authorized user whom it aims at impersonating, whereas the operator designs the security measures to detect suspicious behavior and to prevent unauthorized access while minimizing the monitoring expenses. It is shown that the optimal attacker strategy exhibits a threshold structure, and consists of observing the user behavior to collect information at the beginning, and then attacking (rather than observing) after gathering enough data. From the operator’s side, the optimal design of the security measures is provided. Numerical results are used to illustrate the intrinsic trade-off between monitoring cost and security risk, and show that continuous authentication can be effective in minimizing security risk. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objective: According to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes. Methods: Geocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime. Results: Accounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted. Conclusions: The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Ransomware attacks have become prevalent nowadays due to sudden flourish of cryptocurrencies. Most existing defense strategies for ransomware, however, are vulnerable to privileged ransomware who can compromise the operating system and hence any backup data stored locally. The out-of-place-update and the isolation nature of flash memory storage, for the first time, makes it possible to design a defense strategy which is secure against the privileged ransomware. In this work, we propose MimosaFTL, a secure and practical ransomware defense strategy for mobile computing devices equipped with flash memory as external storage. MimosaFTL is secure against the privileged malware by taking advantage of unique characteristics of flash storage. In addition, it is more practical (compared to prior work) for real-world deployments by: 1) incorporating a fine-grained detection scheme which can detect presence of ransomware accurately; and 2) allowing the victim to efficiently restore the infected external storage to the exact point when the malware starts to perform corruption. Experimental evaluation shows that, MimosaFTL can mitigate ransomware attacks effectively with a small negative impact on both I/O performance and lifetime of flash storage. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group and exhibit various offense patterns. Often the location where the offender committed the offense is different from where the offender encountered their victim. Applying crime pattern theory, this study sought to understand if the type of location, victim, and situational characteristics could predict whether an offender would commit the sexual offense in a different and more secluded location than where he first encountered the victim. Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not. Policy implications of the findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Fraud has turned into a trillion-dollar industry which may lead to risk of financial loss as well as the loss of customers' and stakeholders' confidence on financial organizations. Nowadays, online transactions, mobile wallets and payment card transactions are becoming more popular within society. With the growth of such cashless transactions, the number of fraudulent activities in the world is also increasing. According to the current global economic context, efforts being made to detect and prevent frauds are also increasing. Having an effective financial transaction fraud detection system could save trillions of dollars from fraudulent activities. Supervised machine learning based fraud detection solution is the trending mechanism used in fraud detection solutions. Nevertheless, such supervised machine learning based solutions need a labelled dataset in order to train the machine learning model. The reason for the existence of current fraudulent actions is that labelled datasets are hard to find in real-world environments, and if such labelled datasets are , thereafter such fraud detection solutions would detect fraudulent patterns based on the fraudulent patterns of the fraudulent events in the training labelled dataset. Therefore, there is an extensive business requirement of having a fraud detection solution which can be trained using a raw financial transaction dataset, in other words using an unlabelled dataset which is commonly in financial transaction systems in order to detect accurate fraudulent events. Test results obtained for the synthetically generated dataset shows that autoencoder is able to detect fraudulent transaction events with 83% of AUC score which represents high capability of binary classification as fraudulent or genuine transactions. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: This paper analyzes trading and tipping activities in insider trading litigation decided by federal courts from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. Design/methodology/approach: Legal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes. Findings: Results of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements. Originality/value: This paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The confluence of technological and societal advances, and more specifically, engagement with Web, social media, and smart devices has the potential to affect the mental behavior of the individuals. Examples include extremist and criminal behaviors such as radicalization and cyber-bullying, which are causing serious issues for humanity. Major barriers to the effective understanding of behavioral disorders on social networks includes the ability to understand the content and context of social documents, as well as the activity of social users. Understanding the patterns of behavioral disorders (e.g., criminal and extremist activities) on social networks, is challenging and requires techniques to contextualize the content of social documents based on the time-aware analysis of personality, behaviour and past activities of social users. In this context, semantic information extraction and enrichment from social documents has the potential to become a vital asset to explore the sign of behavioral disorders and prevent serious issues such as cyber-bullying, suicidal related behavior and radicalization. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a novel social document analysis pipeline to enable analysts engage with social documents (e.g., a Tweet in Twitter or a post on Facebook) to explore cognitive aspects of behavioral disorders. We implement the pipeline as an extensible and scalable architecture and present the evaluation results.  © 2019 ACM.

AB  - This article adopts a spatially grounded approach to the study of everyday urban crime involving ruffians (lutis), seminarians, and sayyids (descendants of the Prophet Muhammad). It begins by considering the types of crimes and punishments prevalent in Qajar Iran before examining the spatial exceptions to the operation of law in the form of sanctuaries (bast). It then explores exceptional circumstances under which crime and violence went unpunished, such as large-scale mobilizations involving powerful urban notables. Conflicts over Islamic endowment resources, embedded spatially in shrines and mosques, pitted neighborhoods against one another, with the state playing the role of a mediator and trying to manage social conflict. Raids into Jewish quarters reflected spatially structured conflicts, as well, because the appropriation of economic resources was at stake. Much like sanctuaries, Jewish quarters had an exceptional spatial status since violence, pillage, and plunder could occur there with relative impunity during specific historical moments. This article then analyzes the economic activities of lutis, who were often part of extortion rackets as a supplementary or primary form of employment. The article ends by considering the social biography of a well-known luti whose life exemplifies how lutis faced state sanction when engaged in petty crimes but acted with impunity when operating as part of a powerful vertical social network. I argue that the daily patterns of violence involving marginal groups revolved around access to the resources of the specific aforementioned spaces and that sanctuaries created opportunities for these marginal groups to evade the implementation of the law. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: Microvascular decompression is the most effective treatment for hemifacial spasm. However, when encountering hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery (VA), the procedure is more challenging and requires complicated operation techniques. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of this group of cases and investigated reasonable transposition procedures for different anatomic classifications. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 117 cases that underwent their first microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm between June 2010 and December 2016, which had all associated with vertebral artery compression diagnosed by preoperational radiology examination. The study first classified offending vessels into 3 types according to operative anatomy and designed personalized decompression management according to different forms of neurovascular conflict. Curative effects and complications were assessed. Results: The offending vessels were artificially divided into 3 types according to both arterial pattern and compression direction: 1) ipsilateral VA plus anterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the ventrolateral direction in 72 (61.5%) cases; 2) ipsilateral VA plus posterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the caudal-medial direction in 31 (26.5%) cases; 3) bilateral VA compressing the facial nerve in 14 (12.0%) cases. We selected corridors to expose the neurovascular conflict site between the suprafloccular-transhorizontal fissure approach and subtonsillar-transcerebellomedullary fissure approach. The methods of decompression consist of anteromedial and posterolateral transposition by using biomedical glue−coated Teflon sling. Sufficient decompression of the offending vessels was safely performed in all cases. All cases had total relief of symptoms immediately after their operations. Follow-up periods ranged from 16–90 months, and total recovery occurred in 110 cases (94.0%). In 7 cases (6.0%), 90% recovery occurred. Conclusions: Accuracy and comprehensive recognition of anatomic features of the offending vessels are crucial for the management of hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery compression. Appropriate approaches combined with the biomedical glue−coated Teflon sling transposition technique can allow adequate mobilization of the vertebral artery and bring complete postoperative symptom relief for most cases. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Crimes, forest fires, accidents, infectious diseases, or human interactions with mobile devices (e.g., tweets) are being logged as spatiotemporal events. For each event, its geographic location, time and related attributes are known with high levels of detail (LoDs). The LoD plays a crucial role when analyzing data, as it can highlight useful patterns or insights and enhance the user’ perception of phenomena. For this reason, modeling phenomena at different LoDs is needed to increase the analytical value of the data, as there is no exclusive LOD at which the data can be analyzed. Current practices work mainly on a single LoD of the phenomena, driven by the analysts’ perception, ignoring that identifying the suitable LoDs is a key issue for pointing relevant patterns. This article presents a Visual Analytics approach called VAST, that allows users to simultaneously inspect a phenomenon at different LoDs, helping them to see in what LoDs do interesting patterns emerge, or in what LoDs the perception of the phenomenon is different. In this way, the analysis of vast amounts of spatiotemporal events is assisted, guiding the user in this process. The use of several synthetic and real datasets supported the evaluation and validation of VAST, suggesting LoDs with different interesting spatiotemporal patterns and pointing the type of expected patterns. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Face recognition is considered as a popular application of image processing.This system is a controversial subject right now as this can recognize and track criminals in a crowd, but some take it as an extreme invasion of privacy.Location Based Service (LBS) is an integrated system that provides real time data forthe given object or person. The spatial patterns that these systems provide is one of the most useful aspects whereinthelocation is a determining factor when trying to understand the activities and can thus be used to better understand patterns and relationships between the same. The prototype is used to mobilize as well as increase the authenticity of the existing attendance system by bringing the service directly to application environment.Weprovide a deep analysis of the problem, draw conclusions and propose an efficient executable solution to tackle these problems. © BEIESP.

AB  - A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a convenient wireless infrastructure which presents many advantages in network settings. With Mobile Ad-Hoc Network, there are many challenges. These networks are more susceptible to attacks such as black hole and man-in-the-middle (MITM) than their corresponding wired networks. This is due to the decentralized nature of their overall architecture. In this paper, ANN classification methods in intrusion detection for MANETs were developed and used with NS2 simulation platform for attack detection, identification, blacklisting, and node reconfiguration for control of nodes attacked. The ANN classification algorithm for intrusion detection was evaluated using several metrics. The performance of the ANN as a predictive technique for attack detection, isolation, and reconfiguration was measured on a dataset with network-varied traffic conditions and mobility patterns for multiple attacks. With a final detection rate of 88.235%, this work not only offered a productive and less expensive way to perform MITM attacks on simulation platforms but also identified time as a crucial factor in determining such attacks as well as isolating nodes and reconfiguring the network under attack. This work is intended to be an opening for future malicious software time signature creation, identification, isolation, and reconfiguration to supplement existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). © 2019 Robert A.

AB  - Attackers or cyber criminals are getting encouraged to develop android malware because of the rapidly growing rate of android users. To detect android malware, researchers and security specialist have been started to contribute on android malware analysis and detection related tasks using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, Stacked Generalization has been used to minimize the error rate and a multi-level architecture based approach named StackDroid has been presented and evaluated. In this experiment, Extremely Randomized Tree (ET), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifiers have been used as base classifiers in level 1 and Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB) has been used as final predictor in level 2. It’s been found that StackDroid provides 99% of Area Under Curve (AUC), 1.67% of False Positive Rate (FPR) and 97% detection accuracy on DREBIN dataset which provides a strong basement to the development of android malware scanner. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Crime has been previously explained by social characteristics of the residential population and, as stipulated by crime pattern theory, might also be linked to human movements of nonresidential visitors. Yet a full empirical validation of the latter is lacking. The prime reason is that prior studies are limited to aggregated statistics of human visitors rather than mobility flows and, because of that, neglect the temporal dynamics of individual human movements. As a remedy, we provide the first work which studies the ability of granular human mobility in describing and predicting crime concentrations at an hourly scale. For this purpose, we propose the use of data from location technology platforms. This type of data allows us to trace individual transitions and, therefore, we succeed in distinguishing different mobility flows that (i) are incoming or outgoing from a neighborhood, (ii) remain within it, or (iii) refer to transitions where people only pass through the neighborhood. Our evaluation infers mobility flows by leveraging an anonymized dataset from Foursquare that includes almost 14.8 million consecutive check-ins in three major U.S. cities. According to our empirical results, mobility flows are significantly and positively linked to crime. These findings advance our theoretical understanding, as they provide confirmatory evidence for crime pattern theory. Furthermore, our novel use of digital location services data proves to be an effective tool for crime forecasting. It also offers unprecedented granularity when studying the connection between human mobility and crime. Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - A natural or human-caused ‘disaster’ usually is a vast area where massive and diverse evidences must be located, collected and transferred for analysis to a distant reference laboratory. Every single detail may be crucial for the identification of the causes and/or the criminal action of groups responsible of a potential risk caused by improvised chemical, biological and explosive devices. Nevertheless, the main difficulty is to determine which kind of evidence to look for. A detailed knowledge of similar events/contamination process could be helpful results of a threat analysis (prediction) will be useful (preparation of the plot, logistics, targeting, action, post-action steps-prevention). Cooperative multi-robot systems based on UAV and UGV equipped with modular sensors and intervention tools (detection, measurements) will carry out the screening, searching and collection of samples in the “hot zones” where the first responders could be exposed to dangerous and hazardous agents. Artificial intelligence techniques applied to the acquired data will contribute to improve detection and classification of evidentiary material and discrimination of mixed evidence, all of them critical for forensic investigations. Data fusion and artificial intelligent techniques will also be applied for predicting the dispersion patterns of some biological agents, providing in this way, a useful decision making tool for first-responders. © CLAWAR Association Ltd.

AB  - Cyber crimes are the felonies that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motivation to harm or create physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet and mobile devices to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes involving target computers to infect them with viruses, malwares, which are then spread to other machines and, entire networks. Data mining applications are utilized in many financial sectors for client segmentation, authentication, credit scores and authorization, predicting payment fault, advertising, detecting and predicting fake transactions, etc. The aim of cyber crime data mining is to recognize patterns in criminal manners in order to predict crime anticipate criminal activity and prevent it. Globally the internet is been accessed by numerous people within their restricted domains. When the client and server exchange information among each other, there is an activity that can be observed in log files. Log files give a entire description of the activities that occur in a network that shows the IP address, login and logout durations, the user behaviour etc. This involves several attacks occurring from the internet. Denial of service is a very dangerous attack that jeopardizes the IT resources of an organization or institution by overloading with imitation messages or multiple requests from unauthorized and unauthenticated users. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - Smartphones are pervasively used in many everyday life extents, and have been both targets and victims of malware. While there are many anti-malware applications available in mobile markets, so far there are no public services that collect mobile usage data, so as to observe malware effects on mobile devices. The main contribution of this paper is the Mal-warehouse, an open-source tool performing data collectionas-a-service for Android malware behavioral patterns. During its initial development and experimentation phase, the tool extracts mobile device statistics, including CPU, memory and battery usage, process reports, and network statistics for 14 Android malware applications from a target device. It then stores them in a classified manner on a cloud database. Despite the fact that the work at hand is still in an early stage, the detection model is enhanced with a preliminary detection module. Machine learning techniques are used as a proof-of-concept so as to evaluate the detection capabilities of the detection model, when compared to a clean snapshot of the target device. Mal-warehouse is publicly available, meaning that anyone can download and use it locally and then upload their findings to the cloud service for further evaluation and processing by others. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This study investigates illegal border crossings by rhino poachers into a fenced reserve in South Africa, comparing journeys to and after crime using a rational choice approach. Using various regression models, our analysis indicates poachers prefer to enter and exit the reserve near high rhino densities, while high road densities outside the reserve increase the odds of an illegal entry. The results also show that half of the incursions occurred at a single location, leading us to describe the special circumstances of this outlier. The study lays a foundation for understanding the location choices poachers make and presents a methodology that can be replicated in other reserves. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - property crime like residential burglary is a frequently occurred offence in Beijing. For crime reduction, it is important to know if there are hotspots exist and if it does, how many of them are maintained. In this study, spatial and temporal pattern of residential burglary by Policing command unit of Chaoyang district of Beijing is investigated. The method of ESDA (Exploration of Spatial Data Analysis) is proposed for identifying crime hotspots and test their significance. The results demonstrate that identified significant crime hotspots varied by time of day and day of week. Specifically, the burglary was observed to be clustered in center and south of Chaoyang district but none in northern. While by day of week, the patterns of burglary distribution changed and outliers appeared on Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. By time of day, the burglary outlier appeared in the period between 18:00 PM and 22:00 PM. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This research applies a Bayesian multivariate modeling approach to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of physical disorder, social disorder, property crime, and violent crime at the small-area scale. Despite crime and disorder exhibiting similar spatiotemporal patterns, as hypothesized by broken windows and collective efficacy theories, past studies often analyze a single outcome and overlook the correlation structures between multiple crime and disorder types. Accounting for five covariates, the best-fitting model partitions the residual risk of each crime and disorder type into one spatial shared component, one temporal shared component, and type-specific spatial, temporal, and space–time components. The shared components capture the underlying spatial pattern and time trend common to all types of crime and disorder. Results show that population size, residential mobility, and the central business district are positively associated with all outcomes. The spatial shared component is found to explain the largest proportion of residual variability for all types of crime and disorder. Spatiotemporal hotspots of crime and disorder are examined to contextualize broken windows theory. Applications of multivariate spatiotemporal modeling with shared components to ecological crime theories and crime prevention policy are discussed. © 2018 The Ohio State University

AB  - There are many types of public space in urban from the view of defense safety design. Urban composite public space (abbreviation as CPS) is an important spatial pattern having the attributes of combination of many kinds of mankind activities, such as commerce, amusement and so on. Its main characteristic is that all function spaces are related and interweaved together, and it has multi-level, multi-meaning and multi-function properties as well. CPS is kind of high crime risk area because of the treasure gathering, complex functionality, and high mobility population. The paper classified the CPS of Changchun as linear, grid and hybrid pattern and put forwards strategies and solutions for defense safety problems of CPS, which is based on existing unsafe factors by investigating Chongqing Road, Guilin Road and railway station. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The authors have researched the phenomenon of female terrorism in the area of rational choice and economic benefit. Popular quotations «qui prodesse» and «сherchez la femme» are combined from these positions in the non-standard authors’ approach to understanding the motivational factors underlying extremist movements. It has been proved that the increase in the number of women in the ranks of terrorists is largely due to the so-called economic benefit factor for the terrorist acts organisers. The actions of a suicide bomber, in the broad sense, are predominantly based on a rational basis: the achievement of the last personal good - identity. The article presents the transformation of female terrorism in the historical perspective; actual conflicts and contradictions in international law and national legal systems, as well as false social attitudes and stereotypes complicating the fight against this dangerous social phenomenon. Data obtained from the social networks allows concluding that hundreds of women are now fighting in the ranks of militants in the East of Ukraine. At the beginning of the conflict, many of them hid their faces on personal pages on the Internet, hiding from their relatives a fact that they are hired killers. At the moment, most of them are proud of their participation in extremist groups, post their photos with weapons. Suicide terrorism of Muslim women and crimes committed by female militants in the East of Ukraine have one thing in common - the preparation and use of women as a living «weapon» by the extremist groups is cheaper either in terms of financial investments and costs for psychological brainwashing and military training. Based on the analytical data and identified patterns, we have argued the strategic directions of counteraction to female terrorism and have proved the following: mankind will be able to break this danger on the condition of a new, free of stereotypes way of thinking and coordinated efforts of the world community in all spheres of social life including economic, legal, socio- and cultural ones. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2019

AB  - MANET is exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed by so many attacks like Black hole, Wormhole, Jellyfish, etc. The attacking nodes can easily set Wormhole attack by duplicating a route which is shorter than the original within network. In this paper, we estimate the pattern of relation between packets dropped to packets sent, that is packet delivery fraction (PDF) by Wormhole attack using regression analysis, a machine learning approach, by method of least square (MLS), and least absolute deviation (LAD). A comparative analysis between these two techniques is done. As there is high degree of linearity between packets sent and packets dropped by Wormhole attack, the pattern of dropped packet is proved by MLS regression and LAD regression. Accuracy is also tested. MLS and LAD regression algorithms are also developed to estimate this pattern for Wormhole attack. Wormhole attackers create a duplicate tunnel (wired link or high frequency) from source to destination. An illusion is created by this, that the distance through this tunnel from source to destination is minimal and must take less time. Comparing to this fake tunnel, the original route takes more time. So it is necessary to calculate the time taken to estimate the relation of packets dropped to packets sent by Wormhole attack. Better performance by linear regression analysis for pattern estimation of these dropped packets is proved by simulation, done by MATLAB simulator for Wormhole attack. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - This article examines the predictions of crime pattern theory in a unique neighborhood type. It tested potential crime attracting facilities against street robbery data from 2009 to 2013 in the Police Districts I & II in Downtown Houston. The analysis modeled the four daily human routine periods described in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Generalized linear simultaneous negative binomial regression model was used to determine the size of the influence of the variables (beta coefficients) and their significance for each model outcome. The findings show some distinct patterns of street robbery due to the immediate and lagged effects of the variables relatable to the study environment’s unique setting. Two variables, geographic mobility, and barbershops were particularly significant across three of the outcome models. The results suggest that the physical and social structure of neighborhoods determined by land-use regulations would enhance understanding of the time-based influence on robbery patterns due to crime-attracting facilities. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In this fast growing era of modern technology, it has become important need for people to communicate with each other. Various mediums like social media are used for communication business, organizational details, etc. Due to the increase in technology, there are chances of performing the crimes in newer ways. Using these Social Networking Sites (SNS), many criminal activities have the ability to extract the information. Such activities are spamming, cyber prediction, cyber threatening, killing, blackmailing, phishing, etc. The suspicious messages can be transferred via different SNS, mobile phones, or other sources. Most of the crime-related activities on information on a web are in text format, which is tedious task to trace those criminal activities. Detecting and exploring the crime and identifying the criminals are involved in the analyzing “crime process.” Criminology is a field of using text mining techniques that describe the complexity of relationship between crime datasets. Text mining technique is an effective way to detect and predict criminal activities. Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information or knowledge or patterns from the unstructured text that are from different sources. Since this uses text mining algorithm to continuously check for suspicious words even if they are in short forms or phrases, then they find social graph of users. In this framework, n-gram technique with SCHITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm is used to find suspected message, user, sessions, etc. Information can be extracted using social graph-based text mining, and also the suspected user’s profile has been found. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Over 900 cases have been registered related Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card frauds till Sept-2018 where Indian banks lost around Rs. 109.75 Cr. This paper aims to prevent the crime related to ATM card frauds and secure transaction. In this paper, two options are included like One Time Password (OTP) and Fingerprint detection for a successful transaction. The user can use any of the two options mentioned above for ATM transactions. We know that the OTP is valid for only one transaction and a specific duration. Thus, the Global System for Mobile (GSM) is used for the generation of OTP and that OTP is sent to the mobile number to which the bank account is linked. In case, if the user does not have the mobile to which the bank account is linked or else the mobile is switched off or network problem the second option of fingerprint authentication can be used. The fingerprint of the user must be linked with the bank account so that the unique pattern of the fingerprint can be used to make a successful transaction. Hence this project will increase security and add privacy by making use of biomedical authentication that is fingerprint pattern detection. Therefore this added feature helps to reduce the crimes related to ATM cards. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - As Koreans’ interest in safety and security increases and the desire to live a life without fear of crime grows, the building of safe cities has become a national priority. To effectively prevent urban crime, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the daily living patterns of urban residents and the geographic characteristics of each area. However, Korea’s crime prevention policies have often been determined based on the preferences of policy makers and the demands of residents, without consideration of accurate data. In addition, most preceding research on crime has focused on the distribution of crime based on administrative neighborhoods. There have been few studies that linked analysis on population flow patterns using mobile big data and safety vulnerable zones. Therefore, this study intends to investigate the problems with the location of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras, a representative defense mechanism in the CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) strategy, and suggests improvement measures based on the findings of analyses on the relationship between mobile big data-based population flow patterns and safety vulnerable zones. It also aims to suggest directions for building successful smart safe cities in the future based on the study results. © 2019, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In recent years we have seen a drastic increase in cyber attacks which has led to a rise in sensitive information being compromised. The security measures taken by the organization are being circumvented by the attackers. Data analysis of the past attacks can help us in understanding the patterns and trends in cybersecurity breaches. This way, organizations can come up with more flexible and cost-effective security measures. However, the analysis of past security breaches is challenging as there are no proper repositories that contain the information required for concluding or predicting trends of attacks. Also, the cyber attacks have become very common and a new attack is reported on a daily basis. Hence, dynamic analysis of data will yield better results than the conventional way of data analysis. In this paper, we present the prototype of a tool that can extract and structure information using the public data available on the Internet containing information regarding the cyber attacks that have taken place all around the world. Using this collected data we can analyze and predict trends in the cyber breaches. We envision that the obtained results from the analysis can help organizations in deriving new proactive and effective security measures. This way, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity risk management programs and as a result, avoid similar attacks. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Personal identification is very vital in this digital era for simpler mobile phone unlocking to criminal identification in the scene of crime. There are various methods of personal identification ranging from non-invasive methods of presence of moles in the visible parts of the body to the invasive DNA karyotyping. Other in the spectrum being fingerprinting, lip print, foot print, tongue print, palate print etc. As age advances there might be slight variations in finger print, ear biometric etc, where as in iris the amount of pigmentation might vary but the pattern remains almost same from birth to death, unless otherwise there is any injury to the iris which is very remote. Iris pattern recognition is a non-invasive method of biometric identification. Iris architecture is not only complex but also unique to an individual. In this article a methodology is been proposed to match iris pattern. © BEIESP.

AB  - This article explains temporal variation in repression as a function of the “dissident calendar,” the set of events that serve as natural focal points for coordination. The core argument is that regimes can anticipate the events that create these focal points and engage in preemptive repression to survive their passing. This dynamic produces predictable, often cyclical patterns in repression. An analysis of dissident detentions in China from 1998 to 2014 shows that “focal events” alone appear to be responsible for more than 20 percent of dissident detentions over the analysis period. Such detentions tend to be shorter and rely less on formal criminal procedures, suggesting a “catch-and-release” dynamic. Additional analysis of detentions in Tibet shows how the calendar may vary by issue or group. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This paper explores the effect that municipal policing can exert on politics, and specifically investigates the effect that Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) policing has had on voter turnout and candidate choice in New York City. While extant studies of the American criminal justice system have found that mass incarceration and felon disenfranchisement negatively impact political participation and engagement, few have explicitly explored policing’s relationship with politics and fewer still consider its mobilizing potential. Mobilizing data from over 2.7 million geo-coded police stops and data from a series of national and municipal elections this paper uncovers a pattern of voter demobilization, voter mobilization, and candidate choice that cannot be anticipated from extant studies in the literature. Specifically, it finds that while concentrated policing was associated with reductions in voter turnout in the 2006 and 2010 midterm elections, it was associated with higher rates of turnout in the 2008 presidential election and 2013 Democratic primary and general mayor. Further analysis demonstrates that stopping intensity was strongly associated with candidate choice in the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary, such that higher rates of policing were positively associated with support for the candidate (John Liu) who advocated for eliminating SQF and less support for the candidate (William Thompson) who supported SQF. Together, these findings highlight the impact that policing can exert on political behavior, characterize the impact that harmful policing policies can play in instigating policing participation and engagement, and foreground the importance of considering local criminal justice policy and political action. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study—based on a national data set (N = 1,447)—focuses on extrafamilial sexual assaults and their mobility. Spatial information about the offender’s house, the victim’s house, and the crime scene was combined in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the assaults fall in the categories of total mobility (42.78%) and offender mobility (33.10%). Our results also show the validity of the distance decay function with over 50% of aggressions occurring within 3 km of the offender’s house. The analysis did not reveal the existence of buffer zones, probably due to the acquaintance between some of the offenders and their victims. The evidence suggests that environmental risk factors are more significant than individual ones when it comes to explaining the variation among mobility patterns in sexual assaults. Offenders appear to adapt their mobility patterns and modus operandi according to the environmental constraints. Often, offenders choose their own or their victim’s house as a safe environment for performed sexual assault. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Existing studies have failed to capture the complex social location transition patterns of suspects and lack the capacity to address the issue of data sparsity. Therefore, we propose a location prediction model called SSLP (spatio-temporal semantics location prediction) to enhance the location prediction performance. Firstly, the similar suspect groups of the target suspects are extracted using the distributed proximity of the suspects in different semantic periods and semantic positions. Then, their mobility data are applied to estimate transition frequencies and temporal visiting probabilities for unobserved locations based on a KDE (kernel density estimating) smoothing method. Finally, by a Bayesian-based formula, the spatio-temporal prediction for the individual suspect can be realized. In the experiments with the location recording data set consisting of 158 suspects and their 17 539 location records from January to June 2013 in W city, SSLP model outperforms baseline algorithms by 40%-50%, validating its adaptability for data sparsity problem. © 2019, Editorial Department of Wuhan University of Technology.

AB  - As a measurement of the residential population, the Census population ignores the mobility of the people. This weakness may be alleviated by the use of ambient population, derived from social media data such as tweets. This research aims to examine the degree in which geotagged tweets, in contrast to the Census population, can explain crime. In addition, the mobility of Twitter users suggests that tweets as the ambient population may have a spillover effect on the neighboring areas. Based on a yearlong geotagged tweets dataset, negative binomial regression models are used to test the impact of tweets derived ambient population, as well as its possible spillover effect on theft crimes. Results show: (1) Tweets count is a viable replacement of the Census population for spatial theft pattern analysis; (2) tweets count as a measure of the ambient population shows a significant spillover effect on thefts, while such spillover effect does not exist for the Census population; (3) the combination of tweets and its spatial lag outperforms the Census population in theft crime analyses. Therefore, the spillover effect of the tweets derived ambient population should be considered in future crime analyses. This finding may be applicable to other social media data as well. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine the repeat residential burglars' target selection behaviors. The data consisted of variables relating to target selection behaviors and decision making of 104 serial residential burglars, who had arrest records for residential burglaries in the past. The results of multiple correspondence analysis revealed that residential burglars' target selection behaviors could be differentiated into three styles: “burgling in the absence of residents”, “burgling in the presence of residents while they are sleeping at night”, and “burgling of mixed styles”. Among 14 variables relating to burglars' decision making while committing crimes, three factors (risk/reward-oriented, traceless entry-oriented, low effort area-oriented) were extracted by exploratory factor analysis. The level of burgling skill evaluated by the suspect interviewers positively correlated with a factor score of the “risk/reward-oriented” factor (ρ = .20, p < .05) but negatively correlated with a factor score of the “low effort area-oriented” factor (ρ = - .24, p < .05). These results suggest that repeat residential burglars are rational decision makers, but the way they are rational varies. © 2019 Japanese Psychological Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Face recognition describes a surface framework, which is capable of processing image and detection. The proposed paper demonstrates three contributions: the first is to introduce the image representation, known as an integral image, the second application of Ada Boost learning algorithm, and the third is the cascaded framework. This includes observation, bio-metrics and video coding. Here, the primary objective is to implement a real-time system using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to track and detect human expression. The expression recognition involves colour-shaped coating separation and image purifying. Moreover, it involves different types of search engines which are based on computer vision. A computer controls Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) cameras in CCTV for surveillance systems for the face. The multi-view face tracking on a mobile platform has three methods (local binary patterns) and enhancing procedure. These face detectors are adaptable, extended for multi-opinion face recognition over the revolution ability and face matrix partition scheme is proposed to accelerate the face tracking process. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The traditional two-dimensional (2D) barcode has been employed in anti-counterfeiting systems as a storage media for serial numbers. However, an attack can be initiated by simply copying the 2D barcode and attaching it to a counterfeit product. In this paper, we aim at proposing an authentication scheme with a mobile imaging device for a 2D barcode. This work presents a competitive solution among the 2D barcode authentication schemes that have been verified under mobile imaging conditions. The proposed copy-proof scheme is composed of two sets of features which are extracted by exploiting the characteristics of barcoding channel models. The proposed features identify the intrinsic differences between genuine and counterfeit barcode images in the frequency and spatial domains. An efficient two-stage barcode authentication framework is then proposed by combining the two sets of features in a cascading manner. To evaluate the practicality of the proposed authentication scheme, four databases with different devices (printers, scanners, mobile cameras), barcode sizes, and barcode designs are considered in the experiments. By comparing with the existing texture descriptors and some deep learning-based approaches, it is shown that the proposed scheme has a higher authentication accuracy under various conditions, such as cross-database, cross-size and cross-pattern experiments which study the generalities of a pre-trained model towards challenging conditions commonly found in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, the proposed scheme has been evaluated under some state-of-the-art attack scenarios where the attacker employs several realizations of genuine patterns or the deep learning-based technique to produce a counterfeit copy.

AB  - In developing countries such as Bangladesh, social and economic development is often hindered by lack of civilian safety due to increasing crime rate. In this paper, we have attempted to devise a solution to help citizens avoid potentially dangerous locations using data analytics. We designed and developed a system named “Sachetan”, which is a mobile application that enables its users to privately share their own experience of incident occurrences with precise spatial and temporal information. Two data sources are combined and statistical insight and graphical representation of patterns have been presented to the users. In our research, we tried to find the pattern and determine the movements of high-frequency incident areas by analyzing the data. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Crimes, forest fires, accidents, infectious diseases, human interactions with mobile devices (e.g., tweets) are being logged as spatiotemporal events. For each event, its geographic location, time and related attributes are known with high levels of detail (LoDs). The LoD plays a crucial role when analyzing data, enhancing the user's perception of phenomena. From one LoD to another, some patterns can be easily perceived or different patterns may be detected. Modeling phenomena at different LoDs is needed, as there is no exclusive LoD at which data can be analyzed. Current practices work mainly on a single LoD, driven by the analysts perception, ignoring the fact that the identification of the suitable LoDs is a key issue for pointing relevant patterns. This paper presents a Visual Analytics approach called VAST, that allows users to simultaneously inspect a phenomenon at different LoDs, helping them to see in what LoDs patterns emerge or in what LoDs the perception of the phenomenon is different. In this way, the analysis of vast amounts of spatiotemporal events is assisted, guiding the user in this process. The use of several synthetic and real datasets allowed the evaluation of VAST, which was able to suggest LoDs with different interesting spatiotemporal patterns and the type of expected patterns. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Objective To develop a device of trace bloodstains imaging and age analysis, so as to provide a non-destructive, simple and objective method for age estimation of bloodstains at the crime scene. Methods Based on the principle of digital imaging and color pattern analysis, the mobile terminal of the device was used to collect images of bloodstains of different ages. The time-dependent pattern of 6 parameters (R, G, B, C, Y, M) reflecting the changes of color of images of different ages was obtained by computer image analysis. A multiparameter comprehensive inference equation of bloodstains age was established and embedded into the device software to realize the intelligent inference of the bloodstains age. Then the capability and reliability of the device was verified. Results This integrated device of bloodstains imaging and age analysis could quickly collect bloodstains at the crime scene and automatically analyze and infer the age of bloodstains combined with related intelligence software. In the blind test, the detection accuracy of this device was 95% in both natural light airtight group and dark airtight group, and 80% in the natural light ventilation group. Conclusion The integrated device of trace bloodstains imaging and age analysis can be used in a simple manner, which provides a new objective method for bloodstains age estimation. © 2019 by the Editorial Department of Journal of Forensic Medicine.

AB  - In today's digital age, the digital transformation is necessary for almost every competitive enterprise in terms of having access to the best resources and ensuring customer satisfaction. However, due to such rewards, these enterprises are facing key concerns around the risk of next-generation data security or cybercrime which is continually increasing issue due to the digital transformation four essential pillars—cloud computing, big data analytics, social and mobile computing. Data transformation-driven enterprises should ready to handle this next-generation data security problem, in particular, the compromised user credential (CUC). When an intruder or cybercriminal develops trust relationships as a legitimate account holder and then gain privileged access to the system for misuse. Many state-of-the-art risk mitigation tools are being developed, such as encrypted and secure password policy, authentication, and authorization mechanism. However, the CUC has become more complex and increasingly critical to the digital transformation process of the enterprise's database by a cybercriminal, we propose a novel technique that effectively detects CUC at the enterprise-level. The proposed technique is learning from the user's behavior and builds a knowledge base system (KBS) which observe changes in the user's operational behavior. For that reason, a series of experiments were carried out on the dataset that collected from a sensitive database. All empirical results are validated through well-known evaluation measures, such as (i) accuracy, (ii) sensitivity, (iii) specificity, (iv) prudence accuracy, (v) precision, (vi) f-measure, and (vii) error rate. The experiments show that the proposed approach obtained weighted accuracy up to 99% and overall error of about 1%. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently can detect CUC which may keep an organization safe from major damage in data through cyber-attacks. © 2018

AB  - Trajectory data contains abundant temporal and spatial information of moving objects. By calculating and analyzing trajectory data, behavior patterns of mobile objects can be found. Among these behavior patterns the discovery of chasing patterns is interesting which will provide effective services for intelligent urban traffic management, criminal investigation, environmental monitoring and other application fields. However, existing chasing pattern discovery methods only compare the local similarity of trajectories, and do not consider the potential significance of stay points or change in speed. This article proposes a new algorithm for chasing pattern discovery based on the stay point detection technology. An optimized stay point detection algorithm is also designed to improve the distance calculation method. The algorithms were evaluated with real and simulation trajectory data and achieved very good results which have higher accuracy and recall rate compared with the existing chasing pattern discovery algorithms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences. © 2019

AB  - Black Hat App Search Optimization (ASO) in the form of fake reviews and sockpuppet accounts, is prevalent in peer-opinion sites, e.g., app stores, with negative implications on the digital and real lives of their users. To detect and filter fraud, a growing body of research has provided insights into various aspects of fraud posting activities, and made assumptions about the working procedures of the fraudsters from online data. However, such assumptions often lack empirical evidence from the actual fraud perpetrators. To address this problem, in this paper, we present results of both a qualitative study with 18 ASO workers we recruited from 5 freelancing sites, concerning activities they performed on Google Play, and a quantitative investigation with fraud-related data collected from other 39 ASO workers. We reveal findings concerning various aspects of ASO worker capabilities and behaviors, including novel insights into their working patterns, and supporting evidence for several existing assumptions. Further, we found and report participant-revealed techniques to bypass Google-imposed verifications, concrete strategies to avoid detection, and even strategies that leverage fraud detection to enhance fraud efficacy. We report a Google site vulnerability that enabled us to infer the mobile device models used to post more than 198 million reviews in Google Play, including 9,942 fake reviews. We discuss the deeper implications of our findings, including their potential use to develop the next generation fraud detection and prevention systems. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - In criminology, the rational choice perspective assumes that offenders decide whether or not to commit a crime by weighing the effort, rewards, and costs involved in alternative courses of action. One of the most important costs for offenders is to be identified and arrested by police. In order to avoid arrest, offenders have to rely on specific strategies. In sexual assaults, in addition to appropriate target selection, offenders must make sure to avoid police detection by protecting their identity and cleaning up or destroy forensic evidence that may be left at the crime scene and that can directly lead to their identification. This behavior is known as ‘forensic awareness’. Research on forensic awareness strategies during the crime-commission process is scant. A number of studies looking specifically at sexual crimes identified certain strategies related to forensic awareness. According to the rational choice perspective, the use of strategies to avoid police detection should have an impact on the crime solving by police. Few studies have investigated this issue and findings are quite unexpected. The aim of this chapter is to review some of the most important empirical knowledge on the use of forensic awareness strategies in sexual crimes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The rapid evolution of technology in our sociality has brought great advantages, but at the same time it has increased the cybersecurity threats associated with a constantly expanded surface exposure. At the forefront of these threats is the proliferation of malware from traditional computing platforms to the rapidly expanding Internet-of-things. Our premise is that malware needs to be detected as soon as possible to prevent extensive consequence linked to the fulfillment of its malicious activity. Our proposed framework analyzes task structure features as well as the system calls and memory access patterns made by a process to determine its validity and integrity. The proposed scheme would use all three approaches applying an ensemble technique to detect malware. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings: People older than 65 are the most rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population, yet our cities and transportation systems are not age friendly. Low-income, minority, older adults residing in inner-city neighborhoods are largely transit dependent, rely significantly on walking for transportation, and thus have particular mobility needs. We used a mixed-methods approach that drew information from the California Household Travel Survey but also from direct interaction (through focus groups, interviews, and neighborhood walking audits) with 81 low-income, inner city–living older adults to understand their travel patterns and mobility challenges and needs. We find that despite some positive mobility indicators in the inner city (mixed-use environment, frequent bus service, and short travel distances), these elders face significant mobility challenges because of a deteriorated built environment, heavy traffic, homelessness, and crime. A limitation of this research is that the small sample did not allow the study of possible gender or race/ethnicity differentiation in the travel patterns and needs of older adults. Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely only on information from the census and other aggregate data sources to understand the mobility needs of older adults but should complement this information with direct interaction with the communities for which they are planning. Although some social problems limiting the mobility of older adults are difficult to tackle, environmental and streetscape improvements can significantly enhance their mobility. © 2019, © 2019 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.

AB  - Healthcare data are attractive to cyber-criminals because they contain financial and personal data, can be used for blackmail, and most valuable, are ideal for fraudulent billing. They are also remarkably vulnerable to penetration because of the fluid and always-evolving nature of a patient's medical care and because of the number of clinicians, facilities and transactions required to connect patient care across multiple settings. The addition of mobile healthcare devices and connected healthcare delivery systems (e.g., wearables, monitoring devices, cell phone images) makes healthcare data more attractive but also more vulnerable. Wide variations of digital health use patterns complicates design security solutions for each context or clinician. In this paper we propose a set of connected healthcare patterns, and then discuss security challenges and potential solutions for each of the connected health patterns. © 2019 American Psychological Association Inc.

AB  - Advertising is a primary means for revenue generation for millions of websites and smartphone apps. Naturally, a fraction abuse ad networks to systematically defraud advertisers of their money. Modern defences have matured to overcome some forms of click fraud but measurement studies have reported that a third of clicks supplied by ad networks could be clickspam. Our work develops novel inference techniques which can isolate click fraud attacks using their fundamental properties.We propose two defences, mimicry and bait-click, which provide clickspam detection with substantially improved results over current approaches. Mimicry leverages the observation that organic clickfraud involves the reuse of legitimate click traffic, and thus isolates clickspam by detecting patterns of click reuse within ad network clickstreams. The bait-click defence leverages the vantage point of an ad network to inject a pattern of bait clicks into a user's device. Any organic clickspam generated involving the bait clicks will be subsequently recognisable by the ad network. Our experiments show that the mimicry defence detects around 81% of fake clicks in stealthy (low rate) attacks, with a false-positive rate of 110 per hundred thousand clicks. Similarly, the bait-click defence enables further improvements in detection, with rates of 95% and a reduction in false-positive rates of between 0 and 30 clicks per million - a substantial improvement over current approaches. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Mobile networks and smart phones have become ubiquitous in our daily life. Large amount of customer related telecom data from various sources are generated every day, from which diversified behavior patterns can be revealed, including some anomalous behaviors that are vicious. It becomes increasingly important to achieve both efficient and effective customer behavior analysis based on the telecom big data. In this paper, the Multi-faceted Telecom Customer Behavior Analysis (MTCBA) framework for anomalous telecom customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is proposed. In this framework, we further design the hierarchical Locality Sensitive Hashing-Local Outlier Factor (hierarchical LSH-LOF) scheme for suspicious customer detection, and the Autoencoders with Factorization Machines (FM-AE) structure for dimension reduction to achieve more efficient clustering. Hierarchical LSH-LOF is an improved algorithm of LOF, in which we design a hierarchical LSH process that selects the approximate k nearest neighbors from coarse to fine by gradually narrowing down the scope. Experiments show its superiority over KD-tree w.r.t searching speed. FM-AE exploits Factorization Machines for learning second order feature interactions, which we prove to be useful by designing comparative experiments with five dimension reduction algorithms. With the proposed MTCBA framework, efficient and effective telecom customer behavior analysis including anomalous customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is performed on the real world telecom operating data provided by one of the major Internet service providers (ISPs) in China. Meanwhile, interpretable clustering results of six clusters are obtained to provide valuable information for the precision marketing of telecom operators, criminal combating, and social credit system construction. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In the last years, mobile phones have become essential communication and productivity tools used daily to access business services and exchange sensitive data. Consequently, they also have become one of the biggest targets of malware attacks. New malware is created everyday, most of which is generated as variants of existing malware by reusing its malicious code. This paper proposes an approach for malware detection and phylogeny studying based on dynamic analysis using process mining. The approach exploits process mining techniques to identify relationships and recurring execution patterns in the system call traces gathered from a mobile application in order to characterize its behavior. The recovered characterization is expressed in terms of a set of declarative constraints between system calls and represents a sort of run-time fingerprint of the application. The comparison between the so defined fingerprint of a given application with those of known malware is used to verify: (1) if the application is malware or trusted, (2) in case of malware, which family it belongs to, and (3) how it differs from other known variants of the same malware family. An empirical study conducted on a dataset of 1200 trusted and malicious applications across ten malware families has shown that the approach exhibits a very good discrimination ability that can be exploited for malware detection and malware evolution studying. Moreover, the study has also shown that the approach is robust to code obfuscation techniques increasingly being used by nowadays malware. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Malware (Malicious Software) is a program that can harm the computers/mobiles/networks and affects their normal functioning. As the computational needs are diversified, security threats are also getting complex to be detected. The traditional approaches require updation and are not able to cover the entire definitions of each kind of malicious code patterns. Therefore, an improvement in traditional approach is required to be incorporated. In this work, it is intended to search an adaptive approach by which the machine can learn and update itself from the last learning. Two different appropriate data models namely C4.5 decision tree and Bayes classifier have been used in this paper. Both the data models are promising and provide accurate classification with some limitations. To make improvement on it, a hybrid classification approach is designed using C4.5 decision tree and Bayes classifier. This work is implemented in JAVA and performance is evaluated on several parameters such as classification accuracy, space and time complexity. As per the obtained results, it is evident that the proposed technique is more accurate and efficient as compared to the respective implemented algorithms. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect not only computers and mobile devices, but also smart cities, buildings, and homes, as well as electrical grids, gas, and water networks, automobiles, airplanes, etc. IoT will lead to extensive interconnection between Building Automation Systems (BAS) communication protocols and the Internet. The connection to Internet and public networks increases significantly the risk of the BAS networks being attacked, since there's a significant lack of detection and defensive mechanisms for BAS networks. In this paper, we present a framework for a context-aware intrusion detection of a widely deployed Building Automation and Control network. We developed runtime models for service interactions and functionality patterns by modeling the heterogeneous information that is continuously acquired from building assets into a novel BAS context aware data structure. Our IDS performs anomaly based behavior analysis to accurately detect anomalous events triggered by cyber-attacks or any functional failure. An attack classification and severity analysis of detected attacks allow our IDS to automatically launch protective countermeasures. We evaluate our approach in the Smart Building testbed developed at the University of Arizona Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing, by launching several cyber-attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of BACnet protocol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crime analysts and law enforcement agencies can formulate effective strategies utilizing current crime trends and patterns. Modern computational technologies, particularly big data analysis and visualization can be applied to available crime data and other resources. Visual analytics, an analytical reasoning technique with interactive visual interfaces, is a powerful tool that serves to augment the trend and pattern recognition capabilities of experts. This paper introduces a three-dimensional (3D) visual analytics framework that interactively visualizes crime data and other relevant datasets on a highly accurate 3D model of the City of Vancouver, Canada. This 3D visualization advances crime analysis activities through a more accurate display of the area under study. The 3D visual analytics can improve identification of temporal and spatial criminal areas and provide strategic and effective plans for pro-active police deployment. The open data catalogue from the City of Vancouver, Canada and the Vancouver Police Department open source property crime data were used in this study. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Smartphones have become a popular target for cyberattacks. Malware can be embedded into the mobile applications. Several techniques have been proposed to alleviate these problems. However, these solutions may perform experiments by using simulated data, or may require root system privileges, or did not take advantage of the discovered patterns to build more effective malware detection methods. In this paper, we use the SherLock data which is a labeled smartphone dataset that captures ongoing attacks within the low-privileged monitorable features. We analyze the usage behaviors, discover temporal and usage patterns, and further examine multiple classification techniques to predict the type and the running state (i.e., benign and malicious) of the mobile apps by using different combinations of feature sets. Our experiments identified the best feature sets and methods to detect malwares, and we demonstrate the usefulness of temporal information in the predictive analysis. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This article shows a novel geo-visualization method of dynamic spatiotemporal data that allows mobility and concentration of criminal activity to be study. The method was developed using, only and significantly, real data of Santiago de Cali (Colombia), collected by the Colombian National Police (PONAL). This method constitutes a tool that allows criminal influx to be analyzed by concentration, zone, time slot and date. In addition to the field experience of police commanders, it allows patterns of criminal activity to be detected, thereby enabling a better distribution and management of police resources allocated to crime deterrence, prevention and control. Additionally, it may be applied to the concepts of safe city and smart city of the PONAL within the architecture of Command and Control System (C2S) of Command and Control Centers for Public Safety. Furthermore, it contributes to a better situational awareness and improves the future projection, agility, efficiency and decision-making processes of police officers, which are all essential for fulfillment of police missions against crime. Finally, this was developed using an open source software, it can be adapted to any other city, be used with real-time data and be implemented, if necessary, with the geographic software of any other C2S. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this article, I draw on data derived from an ethnographic field study of covert policing in the United Kingdom to demonstrate that the deployment of covert surveillance has become normalized, both in policing thought and operational practice. In a break with earlier patterns, the methods of covert surveillance are used extensively and are no longer regarded as a tactic of last resort. Covert policing is well anchored within organizational arrangements, empowered by a series of internal rationales mobilized to justify the expansion of covert tactics over and above more traditional, overt forms. The building of intrusive and exceptional policing practices within mundane contexts, I argue, is one of the ways the police have adapted to a broader policing environment characterized by public scepticism and distrust. Policing relies on the invisibility and low profile that comes with covert work, in order to govern contemporary concerns of crime and insecurity without the conflicts which can accompany – and trouble – overt policing practices. As mainstream policing becomes an increasingly extroverted enterprise, introverted forms of policing have come to the fore. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2019

AB  - Mobile phones have become nowadays a commodity to the majority of people. Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study elderly migration in France. First, it analyses whether the decision to migrate relies upon individual characteristics. Second, it examines the ways in which the economic, social and environmental characteristics of the French territories determine the retirees' choice of localization. The paper draws upon a unique database of 12.67 million French inhabitants, with information about their personal attributes and locational choices from 2003 to 2008. It also uses an original database with locational characteristics for the French territories at the level of the 364 zones d'emploi. This is the only study on regional migration in France which builds upon such a thin spatial level of analysis. The paper builds empirical probit and Heckman models dealing with selection bias and endogeneity bias issues. The paper shows that retirees usually leave large agglomerations and old industrial areas in Northern France and the Paris agglomeration and relocate to socially and environmentally attractive zones with preferable climates. When studying the migration patterns within the zones d'emploi, it appears that the most vulnerable zones, which display a lower quality of collective services as well as higher income disparities and crime rates, feature lower elderly residential mobility. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Around 30% revenue has been wasted due to different types of advertising fraud. In view of the continuous emergence of fraud and the improvement of fraudulent means, a click fraud detection of cost-sensitive convolutional neural network (CSCNN) based on feature matrix is proposed. In order to capture the pattern of click fraud, priori probability is introduced and a new feature set is derived from the knowledge of entropy. Then, using cost-based sampling method and threshold-moving cost sensitive learning algorithm to solve unbalanced data training problems. Features are transformed into feature matrix by different time windows to fit the input of a convolutional neural network. Finally, considering the convolution kernel size, the number of convolution kernels and the pooling size of different network structures in this work, effective CSCNN structure was chosen. Experiments on real-word data show that this method can complete click fraud detection effectively, and can complete multi classification without increasing the complexity of the model. A new effective method was provided on click fraud detection in mobile advertisement. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In many domains, applications use people trajectories' spatiotemporal data for impersonation fraud detection purposes. Anomaly-based approaches consist in constructing mobility profiles based on users' frequent paths and schedules and comparing new trajectories against these profiles: if some new trajectory is not consistent with the user profile, a potential impersonation is detected. Previous studies, however, do not include traveling companions in users' profiles, although performing activities in social groups is inherent to human behavior. Physical access control systems on smart buildings can provide activity companions information since social groups naturally emerge on organizations hosted in such buildings and these systems can capture group trajectories. This paper explores the feasibility of using spatiotemporal mobility profiles enriched with group trajectory pattern data as a novel framework for impersonation fraud detection in smart buildings. An empirical analysis is conducted, and results show that it is feasible to add companions activities information to mobility profiles in order to enhance anomaly-based impersonation attack detection. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The core goal of this paper is to identify guidance on how the research community can better transition their research into payment card fraud detection towards a transformation away from the current unacceptable levels of payment card fraud. Payment card fraud is a serious and long-term threat to society (Ryman-Tubb and d'Avila Garcez, 2010) with an economic impact forecast to be $416bn in 2017 (see Appendix A).1 The proceeds of this fraud are known to finance terrorism, arms and drug crime. Until recently the patterns of fraud (fraud vectors) have slowly evolved and the criminals modus operandi (MO) has remained unsophisticated. Disruptive technologies such as smartphones, mobile payments, cloud computing and contactless payments have emerged almost simultaneously with large-scale data breaches. This has led to a growth in new fraud vectors, so that the existing methods for detection are becoming less effective. This in turn makes further research in this domain important. In this context, a timely survey of published methods for payment card fraud detection is presented with the focus on methods that use AI and machine learning. The purpose of the survey is to consistently benchmark payment card fraud detection methods for industry using transactional volumes in 2017. This benchmark will show that only eight methods have a practical performance to be deployed in industry despite the body of research. The key challenges in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to fraud detection are discerned. Future directions are discussed and it is suggested that a cognitive computing approach is a promising research direction while encouraging industry data philanthropy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of an approach to predict attacker's activities based on information exchange and data mining. We gathered the cyber security alerts shared within the SABU platform, in which around 220,000 alerts from heterogeneous geographically distributed sensors (intrusion detection systems and honeypots) are shared every day. Subsequently, we used the methods of sequential rule mining to identify common attack patterns and to derive rules for predicting attacks. As we illustrate in this paper, a collaborative environment allows attack prediction in multiple dimensions. First, we can predict what will the attacker do next and when. Second, we can predict where will the attack hit, e.g., when an attacker is targeting several networks at once. In a weeklong experiment, we processed in total over 1 million alerts, from which we mined predictive rules every day. Our findings show that most of the rules display stable values of support and confidence and, thus, can be used to predict cyber attacks in consecutive days after mining without a need to actualize the rules every day. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Allergen is an umbrella term for irritants of diverse origin. Along with other offenders such as pathogens, mutagens, xenobiotics, and pollutants, allergens can be grouped as inflammatory agents. Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are altered metabolism products of necrotic or stressed cells, which are deemed as alarm signals by the innate immune system. Like inflammation, DAMPs play a role in correcting the altered physiological state, but in excess, they can be lethal due to their signal transduction roles. In a vicious loop, inflammatory agents are DAMP generators and DAMPs create a pro-inflammatory state. Only a handful of DAMPs such as uric acid, mtDNA, extracellular ATP, HSPs, amyloid β, S100, HMGB1, and ECM proteins have been studied till now. A large number of DAMPs are still obscure, in need to be unveiled. The identification and functional characterization of those DAMPs in inflammation pathways can be insightful. Recent Findings: As inflammation and immune activation have been implicated in almost all pathologies, studies on them have been intensified in recent times. Consequently, the pathologic mechanisms of various DAMPs have emerged. Following PRR ligation, the activation of inflammasome, MAPK, and NF-kB is some of the common pathways. Summary: The limited number of recognized DAMPs are only a fraction of the vast array of other DAMPs. In fact, any misplaced or abnormal level of metabolite can be a DAMP. Sophisticated analysis studies can reveal the full profile of the DAMPs. Lowering the level of DAMPs is useful therapeutic intervention but certainly not as effective as avoiding the DAMP generators, i.e., the inflammatory agents. So, rather than mitigating DAMPs, efforts should be focused on the elimination of inflammatory agents. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To identify and compare the space–time patterns of vehicle thefts and the effects of associated environmental factors, this paper conducts a case study of the Pudong New Area (PNA), a major urban district in Shanghai, China’s largest city. Geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis indicated that there was a stable pattern of vehicle theft over time. Hotspots of vehicle theft across different time periods were identified. These data provide clues for how law enforcement can prioritize the deployment of limited patrol and investigative resources. Vehicle thefts, especially those of non-motor vehicles, tend to be concentrated in the central-western portion of the PNA, which experienced a dramatic rate of urbanization and has a high concentration of people and vehicles. Important factors contributing to vehicle thefts include a highly mobile and transitory population, a large population density, and high traffic volume. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - although a lot of effort has been made and a lot of studies about network security have been carried out, the security requirements for different type of network are increasing daily because of the huge amount of malware and hacking mechanisms are developed daily. Features that must be used in network to provide a high level of protection are; detection, protection and recovery. As such, this study include these features and it is inspired from human immune system, by simulating the mechanism of the natural immune system in computer network to provide security and work as adaptive immune system which learn by themselves. in this research we are concentrating more to learn the system by training the system to distinguish between self and oneself pattern by using different mechanism as calculating checksum of the packet and the checksum of system 32 files, and compare the incoming packet with the created database. The system can observe any change occur in system 32 and trace any modification, creation, deleting and renaming inside system 32 When the system in learning phase the number of false positive are increase, but after the system gains experience, the false positive rate will decrease gradually. The results indicate that the proposed system is very accurate and is capable of tracking any change and detecting any malware within the system as well as high efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In fuel dispensing and fuel haulage companies, adequate stock tracking is mandatory for performance and business productivity analysis. Stock monitoring is vital for inventory management; it is a tool that enables adequate planning in terms of importation requirements when stock is low and for general price management. The accuracy of stock inventory depends largely on the accuracy of the calibration data of the various storage tanks and structures deployed along the value chain. Mobile tanks are prone to harsh conditions due to poor road networks in some countries which affect tanker truck alignment and suspension systems, and all these affects tank calibration accuracy. This is further aggravated by various road impacts, and accidents that sometimes distort portions of the tank shape making it to lose its cylindrical profile in some sections. Excessive stock variations is often linked to product theft and sabotage, though this may be true in some instances, but at times, this variations may be as a result of inaccuracies in tank calibration. The dataset presented in this paper contains tank calibration parameters for two consecutive calibrations carried out on the same mobile storage tank. The statistical analysis attempts to identify variations between the two tank calibration dataset as an indication of potential stock accuracy variations. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Mexican human rights organizations accuse the Mexican military and federal police of having taken part in tens of thousands of forced disappearances in the last decade. Curiously, the regions in which people disappear are also sites of displacement and changing patterns of land tenure and production. Yet, property relations are seldom a topic of studies on illegal state activities. Through a state theory lens, including Aníbal Quijano's notion of coloniality of power, this article examines conflicts between private property and communal land tenure such as ejidos in Mexico, as two different property regimes. The article aims to show how the state ensemble not only removes legal protection for communal tenure but also mobilizes legal as well as illegal means to force the change of communal lands into private property. Beyond that, the article also aims to show how these changes in land tenure regulation intersect with the Mexican war on Drugs. © 2018 Pluto Journals.All right reserved.

AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: The extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Consumerization of IT has introduced multidimensional social changes which require a mature security response that is risk-based and demands a high degree of sophistication. As technologies became democratized and societies got equipped with a plethora of high-potential technologies with which to access the Cyber-Space at any time, communication and action patterns would thoroughly change and alter our spheres of professional and private life, agenda setting, political participation, and behavioral patterns. While security issues are being put on the back burner, cyber-rebels and cyber-criminals grow in numbers. New risks and challenges ensue from this. Therefore, this chapter assesses potential advantages and risks of the Cyber-Space in terms of Cyber-Democracy and Cyber-Crime, inclusive of the latest trend of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD). It illustrates that cyber-democratic action and participation are wide concepts that extend beyond classical definitions of democratic participation and emphasizes the importance of bottom-up mobilization and agenda-setting. At the same time, it underlines how freedom of expression and Cyber-Crime interact by using the example of hacktivism and the hacker movement Anonymous. Even if technological (device management) methods and strategies may help cope with these challenges, they are not an entirely technical issue. This is illustrated by the trend of Bring-Your-Own-Device, where issues at stake also concern legal questions as well as psychological ones (awareness, negligence, and willingness to face existing challenges). Therefore, this chapter also pays attention to the manifold legal issues which have been unsolved so far and urges for legal measures to fill the existing gaps and loopholes pointed to. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Opportunity theories and ecological theories are commonly used to explain spatial crime patterns, but diurnal variations in these patterns have received little attention. Furthermore, the theories have been developed in Western countries, and it has remained unclear whether they are also applicable in China, and how their core concepts can be measured in the Chinese context. We use official crime data from a large Chinese city to investigate whether neighborhood rates of theft from the person are related to characteristics of the population (ecological perspective) and to the presence of transport and retail facilities that shape daily activities (opportunity perspective). We test whether effects of these characteristics differ between daytime and nighttime. Our findings demonstrate that both theories are applicable to crime analysis in China, and that temporal variations should not be ignored. Furthermore, care is required regarding the operationalization of the concepts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Suspect mobility prediction enables proactive experiences for location-aware crime investigations and offers essential intelligence to the crime initiative prevention. Recent practical studies and Rational Choice Theory suggest that the crime suspect mobility is predictable. The previous approaches for suspect location prediction focused on the forecasting the spatial likelihood of anchor point (i.e. the residential or future offending place) for a suspect who committed a series of crimes. However, the monitoring data are usually poor in availability for tracking suspects. Thus, the existing methodologies failed to capture the complex social location transition patterns for suspects and lacked the capacity to address the mobility data scarcity issue. Therefore, it is intractable to reflect suspects mobility patterns from sparse monitoring data, which reduces the effectiveness of case analysis and crime risk prediction. To address this challenge, we presented a novel Crime Records enhanced Location Prediction (CReLP) model. By merging the historical crime cases information by a collaborative filtering process, the CReLP model the estimate the visiting intensity at any arbitrary spatiotemporal node for and individual suspect. Particularly, we first obtained basic spatial and temporal units by partitioning the target areas into 100×100 2D grids and segmenting the daytime into 24 time bins. Second, we built a 3D tensor to model the social mobilities of all suspects with each entry in it representing the visiting intensity at each location and each time bin for each suspect. Meanwhile, this approach employed two matrices to express general movement trends among all suspects. Third, we created a suspect-correlation matrix relying on the spatial and temporal proximities of their historical crime events, as well as the similarities between their personal properties. At last, the missing entries in the 3D tensor were filled through the joint decomposition across all tensors and matrices mentioned above. This way were able to uncover the spatial distribution pattern for each suspect at any time. We evaluated the CReLP model using a real-world suspect mobility dataset collected from 241 suspects over 6 months with about 19 thousand location records. The results showed that our model outperformed three baseline approaches by 32% to 63% at RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and 14% to 26% in TMSD (Top- k Minimum Search Distance), respectively. Finally, a suspect's visiting spatial distributions of the ground truth and predicting results between 8 to 12 a.m. were illustrated to show the performance of our proposed model. © 2018, Science Press.

AB  - The rampant pseudo base stations have become a major public hazard. They undermine the normal telecommunications order, endanger public safety, seriously infringe the property rights of the masses, and violate citizen privacy. How to dig out the spatio-temporal patterns of the pseudo base stations'activities from massive spam messages, design effective prevention and control programs, and fight against the crime from the source, has become the focus of government agencies and researchers. The traditional methods for identifying pseudo base stations through the user terminal, however, face great challenges in terms of accuracy, comprehensiveness, and analytical ability, which no longer meet the requirements of identifying small-scale and mobile pseudo base stations. Utilizing data on the spam messages from February 23rd, 2017 to April 26th, 2017 in Beijing, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of pseudo base stations through non-negative matrix factorization. We also constructed a classification model through TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency) which compares types from different classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors / K-Support Vector Machine / Random Forest/ Single- Layer Neural Network) and selects the most accurate random forest classification method. Combined with the land use data, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution of pseudo base stations that send different types of spam messages. The results of non-negative matrix factorization and spam message classification were analyzed in detail. The results show that most of the spam messages in Beijing are sent along the road network and in the central city. The number of spam messages during the day is much more than that during the evening. As time goes by in the day, the distribution of spam messages along the road network gradually shrinks inward. The pseudo base stations that send different types of spam messages differ in the spatio-temporal distribution, but all of them favor the traffic facilities and residential area within the Fourth Ring. The non-negative matrix factorization, which provides reliable results that match with traditional spam message classification, has shown simplicity in performing the analysis and interpretability in the form and result of the decomposition. It can help understand the spatio- temporal patterns of different types of spam messages and provide evident-based suggestions for government agencies to fight against the pseudo base stations effectively. By targeting the source of the spam messages, it is also beneficial for governments to combat the illegal behaviors based on pseudo base stations. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - To identify and compare the space–time patterns of vehicle thefts and the effects of associated environmental factors, this paper conducts a case study of the Pudong New Area (PNA), a major urban district in Shanghai, China’s largest city. Geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis indicated that there was a stable pattern of vehicle theft over time. Hotspots of vehicle theft across different time periods were identified. These data provide clues for how law enforcement can prioritize the deployment of limited patrol and investigative resources. Vehicle thefts, especially those of non-motor vehicles, tend to be concentrated in the central-western portion of the PNA, which experienced a dramatic rate of urbanization and has a high concentration of people and vehicles. Important factors contributing to vehicle thefts include a highly mobile and transitory population, a large population density, and high traffic volume. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Early research on mobile phone adoption among fishers followed an economistic perspective, focusing mainly on access to market price information. Researchers called for investigations into collective and cooperative uses of the technology. Responding to these calls, we explored Burmese fishers’ use of mobile phones in the realms of social life and business, mainly related to information seeking and sharing among the community. Interviews with 23 fishers in three regions in Myanmar suggested that both social and commercial, as well as individual- and community-oriented, uses were prevalent. Mobile phones helped channel information on price and market demand among a limited number of fishers, especially the boat owners and fish dealers. The other segments in the fishing labor hierarchy desisted from individual ownership of the phone, while opting for a more community-based appropriation. A nuanced picture of use and non-use of mobiles emerged alongside fishers’ socio-economic status and patterns of fishing. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Urban and population growth results in increasing pressure on the public utilities like transport, energy, healthcare services, crime management and emergency services in the realm of smart city management. Smart management of these services increases the necessity of dealing with big data which is come from different sources with various types and formats like 3D city information, GPS, traffic, mobile, Building Information Model (BIM), environmental, social activities and IoT stream data. Therefore, an approach to mine/analysis/interpret these data and extract useful knowledge from this diverse big data sources emerges in order to extract the hidden pattern of data using computational algorithms from statistics, machine learning and information theory. However, inconsistency, duplication and repetition and misconducting with the different type of discrete and continuous data can cause erroneous decision-making. This paper focuses on providing a rules extraction and supervised-decision making methods for facilitating the fusion of BIM and 2D and 3D GIS-based information coupling with IoT stream data residing in a spatial database and 3D BIM data. The proposed methods can be used in those applications like Emergency Response, Evacuation Planning, Occupancy Mapping, and Urban Monitoring to Smart Multi-Buildings so that their input data mostly come from 2D and 3D GIS, BIM and IoT stream. This research focus on proposing the unified rules extraction and decision engine to help smart citizens and managers using BIM and GIS data to make smart decision rather than focus on applications in certain field of BIM and GIS. © Authors 2018.

AB  - Mobile devices are always more diffused in the last years, allowing the users to perform several tasks: communication, web surfing, requiring web services. Given the high amount of sensitive data and operations related to these tasks, securing the mobile devices is becoming a very critical issue. As matter of the fact, malware attacks are on the rise and new mobile malware are continually generated with the aim of stealing private data and performing illegal activities. Since this new malware is mainly obtained by reusing existing malicious code, malware detection is supported by the study and the tracking of the mobile malware phylogeny. This paper proposes a malware phylogeny model obtained by a declarative Process Mining (PM) approach from the analysis of some running malware applications. The main idea is that the set of relations and recurring execution patterns among the syscalls of a running malware application can be modeled to obtain a malware fingerprint. The malware fingerprints are compared and classified by using a fuzzy clustering algorithm to recover the malware phylogeny map of all the considered malware families. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed on a dataset of more than 4,000 infected applications across 39 malware families obtaining very encouraging results. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - At the end of 2015, there were 4.7 billion noteworthy mobile subscribers globally, equivalent to 63% of the world‟s population. Mobile phones had all the essential components or characteristics neatly fitted into a small space and designed to achieve high speeds, massive storage, and increased functionalities. Smart phones used to carry out imparting or exchanging of information such as calling, texting, Internet browsing, e-mail, photos, videos, and etc. Criminals can use smart phones for a number of activities. Namely, committing a fraud over e-mail, harassment via text messages, drug trafficking, child pornography, etc. In this research paper, We demonstrate, if a mobile phone is identified in a criminal activity and if it is locked by any one of the locking mechanisms such as pattern lock, PIN lock and password lock, then how to unlock the mobile device without data loss for forensic examination. It is a great challenge for forensic experts to extract data from a mobile phone for forensic purpose that can be used as evidence in the court of law. The experimental results show that our approach can break all kinds of pattern locks. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - We can notice that security problems of inappropriate integration of native and web technologies in hybrid mobile applications (apps) have been covered in the related state-of-the-art research. However, analyzing hybrid mobile apps' unique behaviors has been seldom addressed. In this paper, we explore the influence of native and web technologies integration in hybrid mobile apps on the generated profile of mobile applications. Specifically, we analyze the type of Security Sensitive APIs (SS-APIs) exposed to web content and identify the corresponding usage patterns by systematically tracking function-call-graphs of a large number of hybrid and native mobile apps. Our investigations indicate that the generated profiles for hybrid and native mobile apps are considerably different. Using our proposed tool, called Hybrid-scanner, for tracking and analyzing internal behaviors of hybrid mobile apps, we show that there is more trace of API calling for triggering a specific SS-API in a hybrid mobile app in comparison with Android native mobile apps. In addition, we have found that almost 40% of SS-APIs in hybrid mobile apps are invoked by third-party libraries, e.g. advertisement libraries. This knowledge, however, is crucial for designing appropriate malware detection or vulnerability mitigation strategies. Based on our results, we discuss two main approaches in Android malware analysis field and enumerate some suggestions which should be considered in order to successfully detect malicious behaviors in such new type of apps. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays malware is a major threat to the security of cyber activities. The rapid development of the Internet and the progressive implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) increase the security needs of networks. This research presents a theoretical model of malware propagation for mobile computer devices. It is based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) epidemic model. The scheme is based on a concrete connection pattern between nodes defined by both a particular neighbourhood which fixes the connection between devices, and a local rule which sets whether the link is infective or not. The results corroborate the ability of our model to perform the behaviour patterns provided by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) traditional method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Most overdose fatalities involve opioids, which include prescription medication, heroin, and illicit fentanyl. Current data reveal that the overdose crisis affects all demographic groups and that overdose rates are now rising most rapidly among African Americans. We provide a public health perspective that can be used to mobilize a comprehensive local, state, and national response to the opioid crisis. We argue that framing the crisis from a public health perspective requires considering the interaction of multiple determinants, including structural factors (eg, poverty and racism), the inadequate management of pain, and poor access to addiction treatment and harmreduction services (eg, syringe services). We propose a novel ecological framework for harmful opioid use that provides multiple recommendations to improve public health and clinical practice, including improved data collection to guide resource allocation, steps to increase safer prescribing, stigma-reduction campaigns, increased spending on harm reduction and treatment, criminal justice policy reform, and regulatory changes related to controlled substances. Focusing on these opportunities provides the greatest chance of making a measured and sustained impact on overdose and related harms. © 2018, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

AB  - While the rapid adaptation of mobile devices changes our daily life more conveniently, the threat derived from malware is also increased. There are lots of research to detect malware to protect mobile devices, but most of them adopt only signature-based malware detection method that can be easily bypassed by polymorphic and metamorphic malware. To detect malware and its variants, it is essential to adopt behavior-based detection for efficient malware classification. This paper presents a system that classifies malware by using common behavioral characteristics along with malware families. We measure the similarity between malware families with carefully chosen features commonly appeared in the same family. With the proposed similarity measure, we can classify malware by malware's attack behavior pattern and tactical characteristics. Also, we apply community detection algorithm to increase the modularity within each malware family network aggregation. To maintain high classification accuracy, we propose a process to derive the optimal weights of the selected features in the proposed similarity measure. During this process, we find out which features are significant for representing the similarity between malware samples. Finally, we provide an intuitive graph visualization of malware samples which is helpful to understand the distribution and likeness of the malware networks. In the experiment, the proposed system achieved 97% accuracy for malware classification and 95% accuracy for prediction by K-fold cross-validation using the real malware dataset. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The wide spread use of social network services, especially location based services, has transformed social networks into an important information source of real-world events. Many event detection systems using geo-tagged posts from social networks have been developed in recent years. Besides detecting real-world events, it is also desirable for government officials, news media, and police, etc., to identify on-site users of an event, from whom we could gather valuable information regarding the process of events and investigate suspects when an event is associated with crime or terrorist. However, due to the high uncertainty of human mobility patterns and the low probability of users sharing their location information, it is difficult to identify on-site users while a social event unfolds, and research work in this area is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a Fused fEature Gaussian prOcess Regression (FEGOR) model, which exploits three influential factors in social networks for on-site user identification: mobility influence, content similarity, and social relationship. By integrating these factors, we are able to estimate the distance between a user and a social event even when the user's location profile is unknown, thus identify on-site users. Experiments on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving a minimum mean absolute error of 1.7km and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Two kinds of techniques, namely Static and Dynamic Analysis, have been proposed in the literature to detect Android malware. Permissions and Network Traffic are the widely used detection attributes. Malicious apps download malware at run-time and evade static permissions based detection while they can be detected by the network traffic. The malware that do not require network connectivity evade network traffic based detection which can be detected by permissions analysis. Therefore, we believe that combining the network traffic and system permissions will enhance the detection rate. Hence, in this work, we combine both the attributes and propose a hybrid detection model named NTPDroid, that extracts Network Traffic features and Permissions from the applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards combining these important sources of Android malware detection. We train and test the proposed model using the FP-Growth algorithm to generate the frequent patterns consisting of traffic features and permissions. Experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 94.25%, better than frequent patterns obtained independently. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Childhood poverty is associated with elevated later risks for self-directed and externalised violence, but how risks are modified by parental socioeconomic mobility remains unclear. We investigated parental income trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks of self-harm and violent criminality in young adulthood. Methods: Using Danish national registers, we delineated a nested case-control study of Danish citizens born from Jan 1, 1982, to Dec 31, 2000, with first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and first violent crime convictions at ages 15–33 years. Each case was matched on age and gender to 25 randomly selected controls. Parental income was assessed in birth-year and at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. We considered parental age, the child's number of siblings, parental mental health, and parental education to be covariates. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by conditional logistic regression inherently adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year; we then made additional adjustments for the covariates considered. Findings: We identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-harm, to which we matched 531 675 controls, and 23 724 first violent crime convictions, to which we matched 593 100 controls. We observed inverse relationships between parental income and risks for the two outcomes for each of the ages parental income was measured. The longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, the higher their subsequent risks for self-harm and violent criminality, and vice versa for time spent living in affluent conditions. Associations were stronger for violent criminality than for self-harm. Compared with individuals who were born and remained in the most affluent families, all other income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for both outcomes. Those who remained in the least affluent quintile showed the highest risks for self-harm (IRR 7·2, 95% CI 6·6–7·9; 1174 [6%] cases) and for violent criminality (IRR 13·0; 95% CI 11·9–14·1; 1640 [7%] cases). The risk patterns were attenuated, but essentially persisted, after covariate adjustment. For any parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated with lower risk compared with downward mobility. Interpretation: Parental income represents a multitude of unmeasured familial sociodemographic indices. Tackling the causes of inequality and associated psychosocial and sociocultural challenges to enable upwards socioeconomic mobility could potentially reduce risks for self-directed and externalised violence.
