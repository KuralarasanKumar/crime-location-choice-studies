# Workspace set up -------------------------------------------------------------

# We will be using two packages in this script: litsearchr, and igraph
# igraph is a litsearchr dependency, so does not require separate installation

# litsearchr is not on CRAN, so it must be installed with the remotes package
# If you do not have the remotes package, install it with:
#install.packages("remotes")

# If you do not have litsearchr installed, it can be installed with:
#remotes::install_github("elizagrames/litsearchr")

#load the library
#library(litsearchr)
#library(here)

# Defining the scope of the question -------------------------------------------

# As with any review, before we begin we need to define the scope of the 
# question. Let's say we want to do a systematic review on location choice 
# studies in crime

# other options 
# We can use the 'PICO' format to define the question as:
# Population: law enforcement officers
# Intervention: de-escalation
# Comparator: officers who have not undergone training
# Outcome: police violence
