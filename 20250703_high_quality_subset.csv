ZG city (Guangzhou) is divided into 2,643 communities. The average area per community was estimated by dividing the total area of Guangzhou (7,434 km²) by the number of communities (2,643), resulting in an average of approximately 2.81 km² per community. Although the analysis included only 1,636 communities due to data coverage, the average size was calculated using all 2,643 communities to reflect the full spatial division of the city."
