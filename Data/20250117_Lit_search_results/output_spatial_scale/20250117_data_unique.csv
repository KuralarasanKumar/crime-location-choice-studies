"1"," "," "," ","target selection models with preference variation between offenders","this study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders. analyzing detected residential burglaries from brisbane, australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age. findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders. this research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.","2016","townsley, m; birks, d; ruiter, s; bernasco, w; white, g","journal of quantitative criminology","32","2","283-304","10.1007/s10940-015-9264-7","WOS"," "," "

"9"," "," "," ","investigating the effect of people on the street and streetscape physical environment on the location choice of street theft crime offenders using street view images and a discrete spatial choice model","as street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. however, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. however, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. to overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (svis) in a large chinese city. the extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. as the first attempt in combining svis, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature.","2023","yue, h; liu, l; xiao, lz","applied geography","157",NA,NA,"10.1016/j.apgeog.2023.103025","WOS"," "," "

subjects'. by recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. this robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. elsewhere i have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here i emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, i explain what i mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. in section 3, i build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what carol gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as i will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. i then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. i argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice. a full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what i can expound on here; i follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of iris marion young and carol gould in seeing solidarity as having, as gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' in section 4, i present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the united states and netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in lebanon and germany. in the cases presented, i describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. following this discussion, i move on to the conclusion. place 'is no fixed thing'. the accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). the understanding i follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. a growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. we are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. we should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. so-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. on terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. a lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. people fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc. ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. these people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. if there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. it is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. hippocrates' airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of louis-rene villerme and rudolph virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. the asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. inspired by the moral treatment movement, new enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like dorthea dix, thomas kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. we are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. we are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. as i will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. in the next section, i explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. solidarity, as i will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. as a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. the first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what i will describe below as solidaristic recognition. the second commitment is to responsive action. this hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of iris marion young, carol gould, fuyuki kurasawa, and prainsack and buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. while my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here i use carol gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'. rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. the generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. on my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. if we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. this most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. a second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition i will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. this reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. in her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, lorraine code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. as iris young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. we ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. these structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. this is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. while basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. it is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice. responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view i want to develop. both joan tronto and elise springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. on her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. i would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. in the next section i turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. with and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the sustainable development goals and un habitat's new urban agenda. it is on the agendas of the world health organization (who), the us centers for disease control (cdc), even the world bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major us corporation. public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. in other work i have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. below i offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics. after describing them, i explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. i start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. these three case studies come from the global north. the final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in germany and also lebanon, a country that borders the war in syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world. in [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around african american neighborhoods in new york city. public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the aids epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the giraffe path (gp), a 6-mile trail from central park to the cloisters. the walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. the gp is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the harlem river and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. the closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. by (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the gp helps restore these and cultivate new relations. at the same time, as part of the city life is moving bodies (climb) project, the gp's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. the attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the gp. as iris young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. this erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. the gp designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects. we must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis the terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. one neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at the royal united hospital in bath, u.k., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. the unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. in this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. as noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, hogeway village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real european neighborhood. it has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. family members are integrally involved in care plans. hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. the availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'. preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health. european cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. from an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. in 2004, the mexico plan of action to strengthen international protection of refugees in latin america (mpa), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from columbia and their host countries. northern europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other eu nation. urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. the region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. in both hamburg and berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. in berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. while formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. the coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what christine straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. the city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. the countries, such as jordan, lebanon, and turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing syria, afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. this management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. i highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making. in lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. in this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'i thought by promoting place-making in lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' with his guidance, youth in beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. the blue dot hubs developed by unhcr and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. in the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. these examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. in each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. in some cases it aims explicitly at justice. we can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the bath nicu and hogeway village designs, and also in the gp and initiatives for refugees. attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the gp, hogeway, and bath's nicu. transformative autonomy is evident in the gp, the therapeutic landscape projects, hogeway, and the nicu. attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the gp and blue dot hubs. in all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. i have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place. on the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others. the author declares no conflict of interest. casey, e.

disruptive behaviors, not all adolescents engage in them in equal degree. for the majority of adolescents, the problematic behaviors are limited to an experimentation period and are temporary. however, for some individuals, the first contacts with the disruptive behavior progress to more severe antisocial behavior patterns. the progression of the dissocial behavior from the childhood to the adolescence seems related to a difficult temperament, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, improper relationships with peers, precocious sexuality, poor parent-adolescent communication, arrests by delinquency and repetition. traditionally, the dissocial behavior has been associated with low socioeconomic status, lack of public services, unemployment, marginalization and schools with unsuitable educational programs. however, current conceptualizations view this problem as much more complex. in communities that have covered the basic needs, even in those that possess a good quality of life, we can find children and adolescents with dissocial behavior that thereinafter become adults with antisocial personality. therefore, during the last decades, research has displaced its attention from the structural variables to community (lack of attachment with the vicinity, social mobility, and population density), family (bonding, communication, supervision) and personal processes, favoring a biopsychosocial perspective to this problem. the aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model of dissocial behavior (as defined by the 27-item dissocial behavior scale, ecod127) based on the following predictor variables: a) parent communication (parent-adolescent communication scale, pacs), b) empathy (interpersonal relationship index, iri), c) assertiveness (rathus assertiveness schedule, ras), d) sensation seeking (sensation seeking scale form v, sss-v) and e) risk socialization (social relationship questionnaire, srq, created for this study) controlling for the impression management effect (balanced inventory of desirable responding version 6, bidr-6). method a probability sample of adolescents, 14 to 17 years of age, living in two neighborhoods with high indexes of gangs and offenses was collected. males were 112 and women 86, without statistical difference of frequencies (chi(2) [1, n=196]=3.41, p=.06). all participants resided in san nicolas de los garza, nuevo leon, mexico. pearson's product-moment correlation, partial correlation and stepwise linear regression were used for data analysis. results there was a significant difference in dissocial behavior cases between male and female adolescents (chi(2) [1, n=194]=14.75, p<.00), with yates' correction: (chi(2) [1, n=194]=12.59, p<.01). the percentage of cases is 18% in women and 45% in men. the total score of the 27-item dissocial behavior scale (ecod127) presented significant correlation with social desirability (.47 in men and 44 in women) and its factor of impression management (.53 in men and .47 in women). the self-deception factor was independent in men (r=.18, p=.06), but not in women (r=.26, p=.02). higher dissocial behavior features were associated with lower scores on social desirability and its factors. the effect of the impression management factor had to be controlled for its statistical significance in men and women. of the 18 variables of the social relationships questionnaire (srq) by the point-biserial correlation coefficient (dichotomic variables) and pearson's product-moment correlation (ordinal and numerical variables), only four were significantly correlated to the ecod127 total score: to belong (1) or not (2) to a gang outside of the school and job (n=193, r(pb)=.45, p<.01) and in the school (n=133, r(pb)=.35, p<.01), to have 1) or not 2) a friend group outside of the school and job (n=193, r(pb)=.20, p=.01), as well as to have 1) or not 2) a girlfriend or boyfriend in the school (n=131, r(pb)=.26, p=.02) and outside of the school and job (n=193, r(pb)=.18, p=.01). these correlations were positive, that is to say, acted as risk factors (lower score on ecod127, more dissocial behavior). the variable of risk socialization was created with the sum of these five variables, giving more weight to the two variables of gangs by their higher correlations, so they are multiplied by two. the created variable has a range of 0 (not risk) to 7 (high risk). of the 20 variables contemplated, nine presented significant correlation with dissocial behavior in men, after partializing the effect of he impression management: sensation seeking and its four factors (disinhibition, excitement seeking, emotion seeking and boredom susceptibility), risk socialization, total and open communication with the father and perspective taking. in women there were also nine significant variables: risk socialization, sensation seeking and its factors of disinhibition, boredom susceptibility and excitement seeking, total and open communication with the mother, total communication with the father and school grade. the regression models by sexes were calculated with the nine variables whose correlations with the ecod127 total score resulted significant after partializing impression management. in men the calculation process ended in the fifth step. the model explained 49% of the variance of the ecod127 total score and was significant (f[5, 106]=21.99, p<.01). five variables integrated the model: disinhibition (beta=-.32), risk socialization (beta=-.28), open communication with the father (beta=.27), excitement seeking (beta=-.20) and perspective taking (beta=.16). in women the calculation process ended in the third step. the model explained 40% of the variance of the criterion and was significant (f[3, 78]=19.38, p<.01). three variables integrated it: total communication with the mother (beta=.33), risk socialization (beta=-32) and sensation seeking (beta=-.28). conclusions the results of the present study can only be extrapolated to the population of the two studied neighborhoods and must be handled as generators of testable hypotheses in other similar populations. in addition, their self-report nature must be considered as an additional potential limitation. however, they indicate that the presence of dissocial behavior was high in the present sample, with an intermediate percentage (33%) between high school students (8.5%) and imprisoned offenders (50%). risk socialization (engaging in gangs, friend group in the neighborhood and precocious sexuality), sensation seeking and little communication with the parent or tutor of the same sex than adolescent in men and women, as well as lack of perspective taking in men, were predictors of dissocial behavior. the sensation seeking was defined in the regression models by the sss total score in women and by its factors of disinhibition and excitement seeking in men. these data make an attention call to the council authorities of a propitiatory environment for dissocial behavior. from the obtained models, the intervention must be addressed to eradicate the phenomenon of the gangs; to encourage the internal control or planning and perspective taking in the pupils, through specific workshops within the school subjects of ethic or health care. they also call for the importance to work the open communication, above all with the parent or tutor of the same sex than the adolescent, through these workshops as well as during the meetings with the pupil's parents. furthermore, to seek occupational-formative opportunities for those adolescents that have left the school seems critical, especially for those of 16-year-old or younger, considering the prohibition of working at that age.","2011","de la rubia, jm; morales,

"656"," "," "," ","the political psychology of race","as both everyday experience and a wealth of social-scientific data attest, race continues to play an important role in conditioning not only individuals ' life outcomes, but also their social and political attitudes (dawson, 1994; kinder & winter, 2001; sears, hetts, sidanius, & bobo, 2000; tate, 1993). in particular, it is clear that identifications and preferences often thought of as purely  political have become increasingly saturated with racial meaning (carmines & stimson, 1989; glaser, 1996; huckfeldt & kohfeld, 1989; see also gilens, 1999; mendelberg, 2001), and that conflicts between racial groups and conflicts over racial issues have become more and more central to the main axes of political conflict in the united states and other societies. the purpose of this symposium is to bring together the contributions of five young scholars doing important work on the psychological dimensions of the intersection between race and politics. while this nexus also has critical historical and institutional dimensions (huckfeldt & kohfeld, 1989; see also mendelberg, 2001), political psychology is uniquely positioned to analyze the linkage between race and politics. perhaps the most important contribution of political psychology in this area has to do with matters of social identity - or to be more precise, attachments to racial ingroups and ingroup- related social institutions, on one hand, and resentments toward racial outgroups, on the other (kinder & winter, 2001; tajfel & turner, 1986). simply put, a variety of research suggests that racial-group attachments and resentments are primary psychological antecedents of both white and black americans ' attitudes toward social policies with explicit and implicit racial content (see sears, 1988; sears, hetts, sidanius, & bobo, 2000; see also gilens, 1999). in turn, identity- related variables may provide an essential link between broad social and historical factors - such as the cultural values of a particular society, or the ways its institutions condition and regulate intergroup competition for power and material resources - and the political behavior of individuals. this psychological focus on attachment and resentment has played a particularly important role in making sense of the growing intersection between race and ostensibly nonracial identifications and preferences. for example, an important line of research has examined the growth of covert links between attitudes toward african americans and various race- coded issues (gilens, 1999; mendelberg, 2001). this body of work suggests that white resentment toward african americans has become a strong predictor of support for punitive social policies in the domains of social welfare and criminal justice and that these resentments may provide a crucial psychological link between biases in media coverage and elite discourse, on one hand, and white individuals ' actual political attitudes and behaviors, on the other (see esp. gilens, 1999). elsewhere, largescale analyses have suggested that intergroup differences in the valence and intensity of these resentments - along with ingroup attachments - may account for a large portion of the racial divide in public opinion about racial and nonracial matters alike (kinder & winter, 2001). race-related social identifications also appear to play a role in various forms of political involvement and participatory behavior. one of the simplest of these involvements is party identification or a psychological attachment to a political party that transcends voting behavior (campbell, converse, miller, & stokes, 1960). in studies of race and politics, an enduring theme is the role of racial identity and group- interest perceptions in the development of african americans ' ties to the major political parties. work in this area suggests that a strong sense of linked fate with other african americans - coupled with the enduring historical role of race in conditioning access to power and resources in american society - leads blacks from a variety of class backgrounds to form party attachments on the basis of how well different parties pursue shared black interests (e. g., dawson, 1994). the operation of this principle can be seen in the longstanding attachment of african americans to the democratic party. while african americans initially gravitated toward the democratic party for economic reasons during the new deal era (weiss, 1983), the migration of black voters from the south to the north created the necessity for the democratic party to adopt race-based platforms in order to win elections in northern urban areas (carmines & stimson, 1989). subsequently, the democrats ' commitment to and successful passage of critical civil- rights legislation solidified a pattern of black support of the democratic party which continues to this day. at the same time, social ties and identifications associated with the black church continue to be an important force in black political socialization and participation. in addition to imparting community values and bonds, the church helps distribute political information, teaches political skills, and encourages norms of political activity (calhoun- brown, 1996; tate, 1993; verba, schlozman, & brady, 1995). in particular, as a political organization the church is uniquely able to mobilize by creating selective social incentives for those who participate in the political activities that it encourages (rosenstone & hansen, 1993). thus, political psychology has made a variety of important contributions to our understanding of the linkage between race and politics. moreover, in doing so, it has not merely supplemented other approaches: rather, it has made the examination of psychological processes and constructs a central part of inquiry in this area without ignoring broader historical and institutional aspects of the race- and- politics interface. the five contributions which make up this symposium - all offered by young scholars currently at the forefront of work in this area - exemplify this mode of analysis. three of the contributions focus primarily on the effects of racial attitudes, cues, and identifications on political attitudes among whites, while the other two focus on the connection between race- related social attachments and various forms of political mobilization (e. g., party identification, political activism, etc.) among african americans. the first contribution is offered by christine reyna, amanda tucker, william korfmacher, and p. j. henry, who examine the differing beliefs of supporters and opponents of affirmative action. taking their cue from earlier work on the different frames used in elite discussions of affirmative- action policy, reyna and her colleagues argue that supporters of affirmative action may think of the policy in terms of its  merit- upholding applications (e. g., making special efforts to recruit members of underrepresented groups), while opponents may think of it in terms of  merit-violating applications (e. g., quotas). using data from two chicago-area samples, they find a strong pattern of support for this hypothesis. however, they also find that both supporters and opponents of affirmative action show more support for merit-upholding than merit-violating applications of the policy. additional analyses indicate that a similar pattern can be found among respondents with different attitudes toward african americans. as the authors note, these findings suggest that supporters and opponents of this highly controversial policy may actually share more common ground than is often admitted. from a very different perspective, christopher federico addresses another policy-related topic: the relationship between negative perceptions of african americans and attitudes toward welfare. as a number of studies have suggested, negative perceptions of african americans are strongly related to hostility toward welfare among whites, particularly in the presence of racial cues (e. g., gilens, 1999). nevertheless, a long line of research on the liberalizing effects of education suggests that these effects might be weaker among college-educated whites. taking issue with this interpretation, federico argues that the role of education may be more complex. while education should lead to an increased awareness of tolerant norms, reducing the overall prevalence of negative racial perceptions, it should also lead to higher levels of cognitive ability, thereby strengthening the relationship between these perceptions and policy attitudes. consistent with this argument, federico shows that racial cues are more-rather than less-likely to strengthen the relationship between negative racial perceptions and evaluative responses to welfare among college-educated whites. this strongly suggests a need to reconsider the assumption that education inevitably weakens the influence of intolerant attitudes and racially tinged environmental cues. rather than focusing specifically on attitudes toward racial groups and racerelated policy issues, cara wong and grace e. cho take a step back and examine a potentially important antecedent of these attitudes: white racial identification. in contrast to approaches which have downplayed the role and even the existence of white racial identity, their analyses of data from eight different national election studies conclude that about half of american whites do feel some sense of racial identification. validating the significance of this identification pattern, wong and cho find that white identification relates to racial attitudes among whites in much the same way as black identification does among african americans: white identification leads to more positive feelings about whites and slightly more negative feelings about african americans among whites, while black identification leads to more positive feelings about african americans and an inconsistent pattern of feelings about whites among african americans. however, despite the apparent reality of white racial identification, they find that closeness to the white ingroup is only weakly related to whites ' actual policy attitudes. thus, wong and cho ' s work suggests that social identity may be relevant not just to the attitudes of minority groups, but also to the attitudes of majority groups often assumed to have no real sense of attachment to the ingroup. as noted above, the other two contributors examine the connection between race-related social attachments and political identification and engagement among african americans. harwood mcclerking and eric mcdaniel explore the continuing importance of the church in mobilizing political participation among african americans. in this effort, they go beyond traditional studies of the role of black churches that focus on their ability to educate, impart political skills, and develop norms for political behavior. instead, they focus on the specific activities within churches that encourage participation. more importantly, their model acknowledges heterogeneity among political churches; some churches engage in activities that are more likely to promote participation than others do. in particular, the authors assert that churches with activities that underwrite the costs of participation and churches or that create obligations to participate are more successful in mobilizing their members. to test this theory, they analyze the effects of a number of types of church activities on both political and nonpolitical participation. interestingly, and corresponding with their hypothesis about the power of creating obligations, communication between congregation members appears to have as great an effect on participation as direction from clergy members does. finally, samantha luks and laurel elms address a related issue in race and politics: the dynamics of black party identification. as it has been well documented, the overwhelming majority of blacks have supported democratic candidates (tate, 1993; miller & shanks, 1996). however, they note that in the years since the civil rights movement, african americans have become less likely to identify as democrats and more likely to call themselves independents or say they identify with no political party at all. they argue that one force behind the changing partisan composition of blacks is generational replacement. as the portion of the black population who did not directly experience the civil rights movement grows larger, african americans as a group have become less strongly democratic. to isolate the effects of generational replacement, the authors estimate an age-period-cohort model on a series of over 200 public opinion surveys ranging from 1973 to 1994. additionally, they examine variables that can be considered sources of partisan differences caused by age, period, and cohort effects and examine the forces of regional and economic trends on the partisan composition of african americans. in sum, the papers gathered here represent the cutting edge of contemporary work on the psychological dimensions of the interface between race and politics. in addition to appreciating the psychological constructs relevant to this interface as important variables in their own right, the perspectives which follow also take care to link these

(2) a single wildlife crime often involves a number of offenses; the most common criminal process involves (seller) hunting/hunting-killing-transportation-selling- (buyer) acquisition. (3) the overall inter-annual variation of the crime shows strong volatility, which can be divided into a gradual growth phase, a sharp decline phase and a sharp growth phase, the monthly distribution is high in november. (4) the overall pattern of ""high incidence in the east and west and low incidence in the center"" is shown in the city scale; in the county scale, the shuangliu district of chengdu city and wanzhou district of chongqing city are the most common. in microplaces, there are differences in the main places where offences are committed and transacted under different offences. (5) the occurrence of crime is mainly affected by the average annual temperature, total water resources, the state of natural ecosystems and other natural factors, male and female gender ratio, level of education, transport network density, ease of access and other socio-economic and cultural factors; the level of consumption of the population, the rate of natural growth and the combination of other factors have a significant impact on wildlife crime. the integrated crime pattern theory and rational choice theory suggest that by rationally considering multiple factors such as the natural environment (e. g. abundant wildlife resources and hidden habitats), the social environment (e. g. weak regulation, strong market demand or weak public awareness of protection) and their own psychological characteristics (e. g. the relationship between costs and benefits), offenders are more likely to convert their criminal intent into actual action, which will in turn the criminal intent is more likely to be transformed into actual action, thus contributing to the eventual occurrence of the criminal behaviour. © 2024 editorial committee of tropical geography. all rights reserved.","2024","niu x.; li g.; zhang x.; jin a.; lan l.; li j.; su t.","tropical geography","44","10","1869-1886","10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.20240248","Scopus"," "," "

(2) from 1996, the number of missing-person incidents initially showed a wave upward trended and then fell sharply, after peaking in 2017, because of a series of immigration regulations. in 2020, it declined dramatically again, due to covid-19. influenced by the temperature, school holidays, and festivals, most people were reported missing during the months of june, august, and december. only few missing incidents happened between february and april. (3) spatially, at the state level, the missing population distribution decreased from the coastal border area to the inland area; over time, areas with a great number of missing-person incidents advanced simultaneously from the eastern and western coastal areas and the southern us-mexico border to us inland areas. at the county level, they were concentrated on the edge and scattered internally. (4) missing-person incidents were caused by the interaction of multiple factors; regional population mobility, fertility rate, and the number of vulnerable people had a positive impact on numbers of missing people, while per capital gdp had a negative impact. the power of population-based environmental factors was significantly enhanced after be interacted with social and economic factors, on explaining the missing-person spatial distribution, all of which were above 80%. (5) the underlying mechanism of missing-person incidents could be understood from the perspective of ""social anomie"". in other words, the disconnect between social goals and means led to social anomie, which then induced deviant behavior, including abduction, murder, and running away from home, increasing the likelihood of missing-person incidents. finally, we offered suggestions for disappearance prevention and further study directions. the findings provided a basic understanding of the missing-person phenomenon, contributing to global scientific information, which could aid in preventing missing-person incidents. © starobulgarska literatura 2022.","2022","zhe l.; gang l.; junjun z.; jinlong s.; feng x.; yingying w.","tropical geography","42","9","1475-1487","10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003545","Scopus"," "," "

""x-cell"" street network, road network density, road network permeability of low-speed traffic, static population density and dynamic population density all have an important impact on thefts. only the branch density has a negative effect, and the rest of the factors have a positive effect. ""t-cell"" street network, density of actual residents and migrants in static population are related to robberies. but the street network pattern has not shown a significant correlation with robberies. in general, the street networks with more main roads, better accessibility, higher population density, and higher population mobility are prone to thefts. the street networks with many migrants are prone to the robberies. in addition, the findings of this study can also make certain extensions to the crime pattern theory. since the accessibility of street network often brings risks, it is proposed at the end of the paper that it is imperative to consider how to reduce the crime risks as much as possible by regulating or improving the overall spatial environment of street network during the planning and construction of a safe street network environment in the future. © 2022, science press. all rights reserved.","2022","mao y.; li f.; yin l.; wang d.","dili yanjiu","41","11","2866-2883","10.11821/dlyj020220457","Scopus"," "," "

(2) there is a lack of systematic research on the integration of micro-social and built environment, which may lead to pseudo-correlation or irrelevance. (3) the localized empirical research of western criminological theories is not sufficient, and the theoretical connotation and concept are often difficult to be operated locally. the local knowledge generated by chinese empirical research is somewhat complementary and challenging to western criminological theories, but needs to be further ""conceptualized internationally"". (4) street view has been used for virtual audit of micro-built environment, but randomly selecting audit sites lacks pertinence, because it paid no heed to the spatial variation of micro-social environment. four avenues can be proposed for future research: (1) cooperating with the public security department, employing sensitive data to measure micro-scale population attributes and social regularity, expanding the extension of the concept of ""population at risk"", and accurately reflecting the micro-social environment. conducting theoretical and policy-oriented empirical research. (2) coupling micro-social and micro-built environment, and analyzing the inter-embedding basis and coupling path of the two micro-environments from the multidimensional theoretical levels of society, environment, and behavior. using ""big"" data to depict ""micro"" environment, and exploring the conditional interaction mechanism and scale dependence between the ume and theft. (3) grasping the theoretical connotation of criminology, taking into account the social context of chinese cities, and developing new possibilities for the local operationalization of the core concept of criminological theories.

(2) temporally, the annual change of crime can be divided into three stages: stable sequence and low incidence, rapid growth and sustained high incidence, and steady decline, which are mainly affected by china's population policy, action on combating trafficking, and the development of the website of chinese judicial documents. the monthly change presents a synchronous trend on the birth and betrayal time of the children, with spring and summer being more represented than autumn and winter. (3) spatially, the origin region of selling presents the pattern of ""three sources"" with ""sichuan-shandong-fujian"" as the core, and the destination region of selling presents the pattern of ""north-south two sinks"" with ""shandong-fujian"" as the core on the macro level. microscopically, it occurs in closed spaces with a frequent flow of people, and residential buildings and open spaces with a frequent flow of people. the overall trafficking path is ""inter-provincial flowing out from the southwest source area and intra-provincial flow of the south-north sink area. "" inter-provincial migration is mostly driven by interests and is dominated by trafficking criminal groups, while intra-provincial migration is mostly formed by temporary one-time gang crimes to meet the needs of buying and selling. (4) based on the theory of rational choice, this study constructs a decision-making framework for the offense of selling offspring, and finds that the crime is mainly affected by the comprehensive influence of background factors, previous experience, and situational induction, and the bounded rational choice made by potential criminals under the decision-making evaluation of ""benefit-cost-risk.

(crypto 2021), where not only the adversary is mobile but also each round is executed by a disjoint set of parties. previous positive results in this model do not achieve perfect security, and either assume probabilistic corruption and a nonstandard communication model, or only realize the weaker goal of security-with-abort. the question of matching the bgw result in these settings remained open. in this work, we tackle the above two challenges simultaneously. we consider a layered mpc model, a simplified variant of the fluid mpc model of choudhuri et al. (crypto 2021). layered mpc is an instance of standard mpc where the interaction pattern is defined by a layered graph of width n, allowing each party to send secret messages and broadcast messages only to parties in the next layer. we require perfect security against a malicious adversary who may corrupt at most t parties in each layer. our main result is a perfect, fully secure layered mpc protocol with an optimal corruption threshold of t&lt; n/ 3, thus extending the bgw feasibility result to the layered setting. this implies perfectly secure mpc protocols against a maximally mobile adversary. © 2023, international association for cryptologic research.","2023","david b.; deligios g.; goel a.; ishai y.; konring a.; kushilevitz e.; liu-zhang c.-d.; narayanan v.","lecture notes in computer science (including subseries lecture notes in artificial intelligence and lecture notes in bioinformatics)","14081 lncs",NA,"360-392","10.1007/978-3-031-38557-5_12","Scopus"," "," "

(1) cybercafés have impact on crime location choices of juvenile and young adult robbers, while transportation hubs affect those of young adult and adult robbers, and bars and schools influence all the three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. (2) the supervision role exerted by the ambient population is greater for young adult and adult robbers compared with juvenile robbers. (3) young adult robbers are more likely to target communities with more youngsters but juvenile and adult robbers are not. (4) journey to crime has a significant negative effect on target choices, especially on juvenile robbers. in addition, these findings have great informative value for crime prevention and social governance. for example, (i) in labor-intensive industrial clusters where juvenile robbers frequently commit crimes, we can regulate the number of age-related activity nodes such as cybercafés and bars; (ii) in transportation hubs and their surrounding communities where adult robbers commit crimes intensively, we can encourage the persistence of the ambient population to persist and play a better supervision role; (iii) in communities predominated by youth population, we can survey delinquent juveniles to enhance the precise guidance and support. © 2022, science press. all rights reserved.","2022","long d.; liu d.; chen j.","dili yanjiu","41","5","1422-1436","10.11821/dlyj020210355","Scopus"," "," "

(2) filtering the strong component of the prnu signal to improve the quality of the sensor fingerprint. (3) classification of digital videos in an open scenario, that is, where the forensic analyst does not need to have access to the device that recorded the video to find out the origin of the video. the main contribution of the proposed technique eliminates the details of the scene to improve the prnu fingerprint. it should be noted that these techniques are applied to digital images and not to digital videos. in this work, we show that it is necessary to take this improvement into account to improve the identification of digital videos. experimental results are also presented that support the validity of the techniques used and show promising results. © 2021 elsevier ltd","2021","ramos lópez r.; sandoval orozco a.l.; garcía villalba l.j.","expert systems with applications","170",NA,NA,"10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114515","Scopus"," "," "

[mjo1]while conformance was well established and dynamically confirmed through production performance and artificial lift parameters in most patterns within the field, the complicated inverted nine spot injector-producer pattern scenario[mjo2] was making it difficult to ascertain the offending injectors or unexpected flow paths leading to the condition within the study area. the lower api oil and slightly fractured and faulted geology was exhibiting conditions for injection imbalance and the challenge was to bring the high water-cut wells back to full potential and increase oil output whilst reducing water flow. to investigate the breakthrough occurrences and mitigate the challenge, chemical water tracers were introduced in the reservoir as a part of integrated reservoir management framework to identify flow directions and offending injectors. the phase-1 of the two-phase study, discussed in this paper, was carried out to determine reservoir conformance that was contributing to short circuiting and once the cause was identified and treated, phase-2 was carried out post well intervention to validate the success of the treatment. phase-1 of the tracer study was initiated in october 2019 where two injectors and nineteen producers across two adjacent patterns were traced with two unique chemical water tracers. massive tracer responses were obtained within the first few days in few wells, directly pointing out towards the offending injector(s). sampling and analysis for phase-1 was continued for about six months, after which, a zonal isolation was carried out in one the identified injectors in august 2020. cement was pumped across all the perforation intervals and a new perforation was performed across the top and bottom of the reservoir avoiding the middle intervals that were taking about 70% of injection as per production logging. phase-2 of the study was initiated in march 2021 and continued sampling and analyses are still being carried out. with about 15% reduction in water cut and a three-fold increase in oil rate at the target producer, the study validated that an integrated knowledge of reservoir geology and production behavior coupled with tracer studies was a very successful strategy for managing short circuiting in waterflood reservoirs. the study showed that this sequence and combination of methods can be useful in effective treatment for wells experiencing high water cut across the world. © copyright 2021, society of petroleum engineers","2021","mahrouqi j.; chatterjee m.; hewitt p.; harthi m.; shabibi a.; matroushi s.; al khusaibi y.; anbari a.; rahbi s.; omairi r.","society of petroleum engineers - abu dhabi international petroleum exhibition and conference, adip 2021",NA,NA,NA,"10.2118/207591-ms","Scopus"," "," "

"1085"," "," "," ","adoptive filiation faced with trauma la filiation adoptive à l épreuve du traumatisme","introduction: in recent years, in order to respect the principles of the 1993 hague convention, international adoption has focused on children with “special needs”. these children are difficult to adopt because of their personal situation or their state of health. international adoption leads adoptive parents to move to a foreign country with unknown language, customs, culture and administrative formalities, leading to a feeling of loss of control, placing them in a vulnerable position. some international adoptions cause real suffering for both the adopted child and his/her parents, especially when trauma disrupts the filiation process. objectives: the objective is to understand, from a clinical vignette, how filiation process is implemented in case of trauma. it means, to understand how parents can integrate the real child and recognize themselves in him or her and how the adopted child with traumatic injuries can build a bond of love and trust to others. material and methods: clinical observation concerns a girl, abandoned at birth by her mother and who was victim on the second day of life, of an attempted murder with machetes. the child has been placed in an orphanage since that day. the aggression had serious after effects, not only physically but also psychologically. thus, since the age 3 years, she has developed self-destructive behaviors with endangerments, including life-threatening situations. the first meeting between this child, aged 6, and her adoptive parents takes place at the orphanage. not supported in this approach, parents are confronted with the relational difficulties of their adoptive daughter. very isolated in a foreign country, they feel a deep uneasiness and they question the validity of the adoption process, causing shame and guilt and even suicidal ideation. once in france, the girl adapts quickly to the culture of her new country. psychotherapy undertaken to put into words the emotions and the behaviors allows an appeasement in the family relations and the disappearance of violent agitations. but the process of filiation, still hampered by the trauma of this violent first meeting, requires the pursuit of psychotherapy to allow parents to accept the loss of the object, here the imaginary child and the parental ideal. results: from this clinical observation, it appears that the first interactions between parents and adopted child play an important role in the construction of relationship. the parents welcome the child with a set of fantastical representations that reveal the place that has been given to him. adaptation will be done by psychic movements, by comparing and relativizing the imagined child with the real child. it is a double movement of adaptation of both parents and child. in the mourning of the imaginary child, there is also the mourning of the perfect parent; it is in the articulation of these two losses that the depressive state of the baby blues arises. this baby blues can evolve into psychotrauma in case of confrontation with the violence of reality. thirty percent of adopted children have, at the time of adoption, disorganized attachment patterns; but adoption would most often enable recovery through the mobilization of parents’ psychic abilities and their own attachment patterns. hence, a necessary assistance for parents. conclusion: in the current context of international adoption, it is important to provide prevention with specialized places and trained teams in order to recognize critical situations, help families and enable filiation process to take place. © 2017 elsevier masson sas","2017","guivarch j.; krouch t.; lecamus s.; vedie c.","annales medico-psychologiques","175","8","705-709","10.1016/j.amp.2017.02.013","Scopus"," "," "

"1140"," "," "," ","ultrasound for crimp inspection","in copper wire, real time crimp monitoring has traditionally been based on force measurement during the crimp cycle. the force attributed to molding the copper wire into the terminal is a significant portion of the total force needed to form the crimp. therefore, any wire deviation from the norm is translated into a force pattern aberration that can be detected using basic signal pattern analysis. as the mobility industry is contemplating replacing copper with aluminum wire, in order to save on weight and material cost, the traditional force monitoring becomes ineffective in detecting wire faults in the crimp. the reason is that aluminum is softer than copper, and most of the force exerted during the crimp cycle is consumed by forming the copper terminal itself. the small force deviation due to an aluminum wire fault becomes much more difficult to detect. therefore, a new technique is needed to monitor crimped aluminum wires. in this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using ultrasound technology to monitor a crimp press cycle in order to separate a normal from a faulty crimp. copyright © 2016 sae international.","2016","maalouf k.; stull d.; nicholas k.","sae international journal of engines","9","3","1393-1397","10.4271/2016-01-0104","Scopus"," "," "

"1236"," "," "," ","introduction","in examining the political consequences of government countermeasures designed to combat terrorism and the policy outcomes that change democratic institutions, processes, and values, this volume addresses two important but often-neglected questions: what are the political consequences of counterterrorism measures taken by liberal democracies and the international institutions that link them? and how severe are the negative effects of counterterrorism on civil liberties, the rule of law, and patterns of democratic governance? we focus here on advanced liberal democracies other than the united states in order to provide historical and comparative perspective.1 the effects of the american global war on terrorism have been studied extensively, but the discussion is not always situated in a broader international context.2 this volume does not deal specifically with the united states, but several of the chapters consider the american case within a comparative framework. many of the discussions are also concerned with the divisions between the united states and europe in dealing with contemporary terrorism. also, since the shock of the 9/11 attacks, legal scholars have addressed the effects of counterterrorism much more energetically and thoroughly than have political scientists. this volume is the beginning of an effort to fill the gap in our understanding of the political as well as the legal impact of democratic responses to terrorism.3 counterterrorism policy is controversial, and it is almost certain to become more so if governments continue to strengthen their response to terrorism. democratic governments do not initiate counterterrorism policy with the express intent of undermining democracy, but they may be too ready to accept the idea of an inevitable trade-off between security and liberty; to think that because terrorists might exploit democracy, attractive ""loopholes"" must be closed; or to deny the real costs of counterterrorism. fears of failing to prevent a disastrous terrorist attack causing a large loss of civilian lives may lead policymakers to take a shortsighted and overconfident view of the ability of robust security measures to prevent terrorism. the contributors to this volume agree that the effects of the response to terrorism have been costly to democracy in many ways, but that within certain broad outlines, policy consequences have differed in nature and severity. in general, policy changes since 2001 have been much more damaging to democracy than earlier counterterrorism measures, even as responses to the threat of al qaeda and its associated groups have usually not departed radically from counterterrorism policies of the past. a key consideration in analyzing these issues is the possibility that a government's response to terrorism will diminish democracy more than the acts of terrorism themselves. liberal democracies confront painful policy choices: terrorism is a threat that must be confronted in order to preserve the safety and security of the nation, but counterterrorist policies can diminish individual civil liberties and alter patterns of governance to the detriment of democracy. measures designed to prevent terrorism often limit the basic rights and freedoms of citizens, invade their privacy, strengthen executive power, centralize police and intelligence bureaucracies, blur the distinction between domestic intelligence and law enforcement functions, expand the influence of the military in decisionmaking, cloak decisionmaking processes in secrecy, and encourage undemocratic shifts in public attitudes and political values (such as intolerance toward minorities or unquestioning acceptance of erosions of civil liberties).4 in fact, as john e. finn's chapter notes, it is not a simple matter even to determine what national counterterrorism policies are. their scope goes well beyond specifically labeled antiterrorism legislation, and counterterrorism regimes are constantly changing. internationally, common strategies against terrorism can lead to closed borders and reliance on military force over criminal justice, as well as infringements of individual rights. disagreements over how to deal with terrorism spark controversy and partisanship within and between nations. the bush administration's pursuit of a global war on terror frustrated many allies-and where governments were supportive of the united states, their publics often were not. risk perceptions and conceptions of ""homeland security"" diverge (föhrenbach 2006). many of the political consequences of counterterrorism efforts are unintended or secondary, although some cynical observers might suspect that governments, particularly officials of the executive branch, manipulate the threat of terrorism to expand their powers. the effects discussed here, however, seem frequently to have been unanticipated. in the heat of the moment of crisis, governments tend to act in haste without fully considering either the full scope of the alternative actions that are open to them or the consequences of that range of options. lack of forethought and preparation produces decisions that are less than optimally rational, and publics have little chance to weigh in even if they have the inclination, expertise, and information to do so. there is insufficient check on what the government does. the question then is how enduring such changes are and whether they can be reversed if their effects are later judged harmful to democracy. this is a key element of the concept of proportionality of response to threat. experiences and perceptions of the threat of terrorism vary considerably among countries, not just between the united states and the rest of the world, and responses differ according to the threat and according to context. before the 9/11 attacks, the consensus was that democracies confronting internal threats or ""domestic terrorism"" were more likely to adopt policies that undermine democratic principles than were democracies facing terrorism originating from outside, or ""international terrorism"" (charters 1994, 213-14). that is, states presumably react more harshly to civil violence from groups composed of their own citizens acting within their borders than to violence organized by foreigners or occurring outside the country. the implications of violent dissent from within seemed much more serious than the external threat of terrorist attack, which before 9/11 was considered minor and was in fact extremely rare. in general, terrorism was not a national security issue, although the reagan administration took international terrorism quite seriously, blamed soviet ""state sponsorship"" of terrorism as part of the cold war rivalry, and bombed libya in 1986 in retaliation for libyan complicity in terrorism directed against american targets in west germany. since the american declaration of a war on terror, however, the argument that internal terrorism is most provocative can certainly no longer be sustained. it is also interesting to note that the european union (eu) list of terrorist organizations makes a distinction between domestic groups and those with foreign affiliations or transnational ambitions, and that the two types are subject to different levels of sanctions (see chapter 3). complicating matters, as we have come to recognize in the period since the 9/11 attacks, is the fact that many terrorist conspiracies are mixed in origin rather than exclusively internal or external, a point that dirk haubrich stresses in his chapter on the united kingdom. terrorist plots often involve a combination of citizens of the state and noncitizens or local operatives with external direction, resources, or inspiration.5 many such plots are rooted in social and family networks that are transnational. these groups are not directed by states, although their leaders may seek refuge in lawless areas, ally themselves with weak regimes such as the taliban, or seek support from diasporas located abroad. national borders are increasingly blurred and permeable, especially as electronic communications make it easier to organize underground conspiracies across continents and to publicize a group's ambitions worldwide to mobilize support and inspire imitation. because some terror plots now emanate from sources formerly considered benign or inconsequential, expressions of religious faith or identity can seem alarming. germany and japan, for example, have removed protected religious status from some opposition groups charged with using or advocating terrorism. britain also cracked down on mosques led by radical islamist clerics who preached support for anti-western terrorism, such as abu qatada, although britain was relatively slow to act even after the 9/11 attacks. it has become harder to obtain such privileged status, but the long-term effects are still uncertain. one possibility is that radical activity will shift from mosques or on other public religious establishments to underground venues or onto the internet. © 2010 by russell sage

"1240"," "," "," ","demographic transformations structural contexts and transitions to adulthood","a new era of mass immigration, accelerating since the 1970s and largely coming from developing countries of latin america and asia, has transformed the ethnic composition of the u.s. population. today about 70 million people are of foreign birth or parentage-23 percent of all americans, including 90 percent of all asians and 76 percent of all hispanics (portes and rumbaut 2006). they include nearly 70 million foreign-born persons-of whom 12 million are estimated to be undocumented immigrants, mostly from mexico and central america (passell 2006)-and another 40 million of foreign parentage. this immigrant-stock population, the largest ever, is a youthful one-and todays u.s.-born second generation, with a median age of twelve, is poised to explode into adulthood in the coming ten to twenty years. they are coming of age in an otherwise aging society undergoing profound social and economic transformations, a process that is straining the social contract between natives and newcomers and raising questions about how the commitment to democratic values of equity and inclusion will be met (myers 2007; tienda 2002). the incorporation of these newcomers has coincided with a postindustrial period of economic restructuring and rising inequality, during which the returns to education and advanced educational credentials have sharply increased. simultaneously, the u.s. labor market has become bifurcated into high-tech/high-wage and manual/low-wage sectors-attracting distinct streams of immigrant workers, from skilled professionals to undocumented laborers. as the post-world war ii era of sustained economic growth, low unemployment, and rising real wages ended for most workers by the early 1970s, men with only a high-school degree or less were hardest hit. for example, the proportion of those workers who failed to earn enough in a year to support a family of four at the poverty line grew between 1975 and 1993 from 25 to 50 percent among hispanics, from 31 to 45 percent among non-hispanic blacks, and from 14 to 24 percent among non-hispanic whites (danziger 2004). postsecondary schooling significantly lengthened for young people, with the years from eighteen to the mid- and even late twenties becoming increasingly devoted, often with continuing parental support, to the accumulation of human capital and college credentials. many changes occurred at this time-women entered the labor market in large numbers and worked longer hours, two-income families became the norm, and the baby boom was followed by a baby bust and delayed childbearing. additionally, there were changes in family forms, including what has come to be called a ""retreat from marriage,"" with high divorce rates (which peaked in 1980 but have remained high since) and sharp increases in cohabitation and nonmarital childbearing (landale et al. 2006). in short, social timetables that were widely observed a half century ago for accomplishing adult transitions have become less predictable and more prolonged, diverse, and disordered (settersten et al. 2005). the new era of mass immigration has also coincided with an era of mass imprisonment in the united states, which has further transformed paths to adulthood among young men with low levels of education (pettit and western 2004). the number of adults incarcerated in federal or state prisons or local jails in the united states skyrocketed during this period, quadrupling from over 500,000 in 1980 to 2.2 million in 2005 (u.s. department of justice 2006). the majority are young men between eighteen and thirty-four. those figures do not include the much larger number of those on probation (convicted offenders not incarcerated) or parole (under community supervision after a period of incarceration). when they are added to the incarceration totals, over 7 million adults were under correctional supervision in the united states in 2006. imprisonment rates vary widely by gender (over 90 percent of inmates in federal and state prisons are men); by racial-ethnic groups (there were 4,834 black male prisoners per 100,000 black males in the united states, compared to 1,778 hispanic males per 100,000 and 681 white males per 100,000, although since 1985 hispanics have been the fastest growing group being imprisoned); and by education. this is most salient among racial minorities for whom becoming a prisoner has become a modal life event in early adulthood. stunningly, as pettit and western (2004) have noted, a black male high school dropout born in the late 1960s had a nearly 60 percent chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s, and recent birth cohorts of black men are more likely to have prison records than military records or bachelors degrees. whether the future of latino men without a high school diploma will approximate those patterns or not remains an open empirical question. during the years of the transition to adulthood from the late teens through the twenties, as postsecondary educational attainment has become critical to social mobility for both men and women, incarceration (for young men) and early childbearing (for young women) have emerged as two turning points- albeit fundamentally different ones-that can derail life course trajectories by blocking or disrupting educational and occupational opportunities to develop human capital and move into the economic mainstream. having a prison record is not only linked to unemployment, lower wages, marital and family instability, and severe restrictions on social and voting rights (including lifetime disenfranchisement in many states), but also to stigmatized identities and pathways to criminal recidivism (laub and sampson 2003). in a cycle of cumulative disadvantage, young men and women with low levels of education are significantly more likely to become prisoners or young parents, respectively, than same-age and same-sex peers with higher levels of education. © 2010 by rutgers university press. all rights reserved.","2010","rumbaut r.g.","health issues in latino males: a social and structural approach",NA,NA,"17-31",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

"1244"," "," "," ","how does leaving high poverty neighborhoods affect the employment prospects of low income mothers and youth evidence from the moving to opportunity experiment","consider two very different cases of the role of relocation in the economic lives of low-income black women. anique and her daughter clara (all names used are pseudonyms) left public housing in a high-poverty' high-crime neighborhood of south los angeles seven years ago. since then' anique has struggled to line up steady work and child care while bouncing from apartment to apartment in l.a.'s sprawling housing market. at one point' her daily commute was seventy miles each way' from long beach' where her mother and sister provided child care' to her job in riverside county. but anique had considerable work experience' and the skills and confidence that often come with that experience' at the time of her move. as we completed our visits with her in 2005' she and clara were living in a neighborhood that felt safe' across the street from anique's steady new job as a child support investigator with county government. kimberlyn and her two teenaged boys also relocated from a public housing project in south los angeles to a much safer neighborhood in the san fernando valley. kimberlyn credits that relocation-her ""last chance'"" she recalls-with getting her away from an abusive relationship. although the new neighborhood provided safer' better schools for her sons' which kimberlyn prized' she experienced racial harassment from white neighbors in her apartment complex. plus' kimberlyn was on welfare when she moved and had almost no work experience or credentials. when she could not or would not secure' in the valley' the job training and other resources she knew she needed' she moved her family back to south los angeles and put her sons back into the much more disruptive and dangerous schools there. kimberlyn has been unable to line up steady work and is back on welfare after stints as a security officer and brief spells in training. the child care her sister had provided in south los angeles abruptly disappeared' and her mother's needs are a major burden. for roughly half a century' policymakers and researchers have debated the impacts of place' and in particular of living in inner-city ghettos' on employment and self-sufficiency. images of the welfaredependent or socially isolated ghetto poor' together with evidence of a spatial mismatch between increasingly decentralized job locations and the neighborhoods where low-skilled people are concentrated' fueled an interest in housing policy as a tool for shifting the ""geography of opportunity"" (abrams 1955; briggs 2005; downs 1973; wilson 1987). created in 1974' the federal rental housing voucher program allows lowincome families to use government-provided housing subsidies to move away from poor and high-risk communities. yet these families' minorities most of all' continue to face extraordinary barriers' such as racial discrimination' landlord refusal to accept the vouchers' the exclusion of affordable rental housing from more affluent and white communities' search costs' and more (massey and denton 1993; pendall 2000; turner 1998). plus' some families have their own reasons for preferring poorer' more racially segregated areas to the unwelcome alternatives they perceive. yet research on the long-run effects of programs that seek to expand housing choice by facilitating access to better neighborhoods-an approach known as ""assisted housing mobility""-has suggested that these efforts can improve the life outcomes of low-income' mostly minority adults and their children in several dimensions' including education' safety and security' mental health' employment' and self-sufficiency. two programs' in particular' found their way to the headlines in the wake of hurricane katrina and the unprecedented relocation it forced. in 1994' encouraging results from the gautreaux housing desegregation program (rubinowitz and rosenbaum 2000) spurred the federal government to invest $70 million in the randomized moving to opportunity experiment (mto). at baseline' only about one-quarter of mto adults were working; most were on welfare (goering and feins 2003). although mto was not designed to directly address participants' employment status or employability- including the barriers to work that low-skill single mothers often face-the experiment had the research-based expectation that if families moved to low-poverty neighborhoods' adults could become employed or get better jobs by moving closer to employment centers' developing more useful job networks (as a form of social capital) with more advantaged neighbors' and/or gaining momentum from an environment with stronger work norms. controversial or not' realistic or not' these expectations were real' particularly in the minds of policymakers. notwithstanding some encouraging evidence concerning early impacts of mto on employment and welfare receipt at some sites' at the interim mark some four to seven years after random assignment' there were no generalized treatment effects on employment' earnings' or self-sufficiency (orr et al. 2003). significantly' though' more than twice as many mto adults were working in all groups (orr et al. 2003)-this over a period in which labor markets were tight and time limits on welfare assistance began to show effects-and many mto families faced important barriers to work' in the form of chronic illnesses' lack of child care' and more (popkin' harris' and cunningham 2001). so the market and entitlement reform effects may have swamped any treatment effect of mto' at least in the short run. moreover' by the interim point' many experimental-group families had moved on to somewhat poorer neighborhoods' for a range of reasons. yet additional analyses of the interim impacts survey suggest that the employment picture may be more complex and mixed than initially thought' with positive effects for subgroups of adults or particular sites' and that interference and other challenges limit the experiment as a source of unbiased estimates of neighborhood effects' which are notoriously difficult to attribute. in this chapter' rather than estimate mto treatment effects' we use qualitative and quantitative analyses to analyze how and why the mixed patterns obtain for employment. the focus of our qualitative work is nonexperimental analyses of causal mechanisms' including social processes' that tie place of residence to economic opportunity. we employ a mixed-method approach that is particularly crucial for advancing our understanding of the role that structural factors as well as choice play in the lives of the poor in a changing society (see newman and massengill 2006). copyright © 2011 university of pennsylvania press. all rights reserved.","2010","de souza briggs x.;

"1251"," "," "," ","the place of race in health disparities how family background and neighborhood conditions in childhood impact later life health","health is distributed unevenly' following a gradient that is a function of socioeconomic advantage and mirrors the pattern of neighborhood disadvantage. among the steepest of such gradients is that of the united states' where there are large differences across people on measures of neighborhood environments' early childhood experiences' education' income' and housing quality. persistent residential segregation of poor and minority populations has spurred a growing number of studies that investigate the effects of community background on a variety of socioeconomic outcomes. however' the role of the physical and socioeconomic neighborhood in contributing to health disparities has been relatively unexplored. analyses of health disparities have instead focused largely on individual- and family- level determinants of health outcomes. over the past decade' however' we have witnessed a renewed research and policy interest and recognition of the salience of nonmedical determinants of health' especially the socioeconomic determinants of health that derive from differential neighborhood quality (schoeni et al. 2008). previous research has shown that such individual health behaviors as cigarette smoking' alcohol use' diet' and exercise explain a relatively small amount of race and socioeconomic differences in health status (lantz et al. 2001)' but it leaves open the question of the importance of parental socioeconomic status via its effect on access to neighborhood amenities. this chapter reports on recent research by the author on the influence of neighborhood conditions on health over the life course' with a particular focus on how childhood neighborhoods affect health later in life. in this research i take the perspective that disadvantaged neighbor- hood exposures may both accumulate and beget future exposures due to links between neighborhood characteristics and the socioeconomic mobility process. in particular' in the united states' there are substantial racial differences in the incidence and persistence of exposure to highpoverty neighborhoods (johnson 2008b). moreover' in terms of health' blacks can expect to live six fewer years than whites' and can expect to live more years with chronic health problems (hayward and heron 1999)' with most of the black-white difference in life expectancy stemming from racial differences in mortality rates prior to age 65. racial disparities in neighborhood exposures' in childhood and adulthood' and the relationship between these disparities and those in health provide an important backdrop and motivation for this inquiry. stressful neighborhood conditions due to high poverty rates' crime' violence' and weaker sources of social support may lead to increased risk of high blood pressure and accelerated rates of health deterioration more generally. there are well-known differences across neighborhoods in the amount of perceived safety; availability and quality of public spaces and recreational facilities; tobacco advertising; liquor stores; and availability and cost of nutritious foods. the empirical question is whether differences across neighborhoods in the prevalence of particular health conditions do in fact reflect causal processes operating over the life course. given the known lengthy latency periods before most health effects manifest (e.g.' hypertension)' it is important to examine whether later-life racial health disparities are rooted in early-life childhood circumstances. it is also important to examine whether racial differences in adult health status are the result of a long-term cumulative process of socioeconomic environmental exposures over the life cycle. the selected studies highlighted in this chapter seek to identify causal influences on the life cycle trajectory of health inequality using innovative research designs to separate causal impacts of neighborhoods from correlations arising from familial selection into neighborhoods. the typical analytical approach used in neighborhood studies is to regress individual level outcomes such as health on neighborhood-level factors such as census tract mean income' poverty rates' or rates of single motherhood. but attempts to estimate causal effects of neighborhood context have faced well-documented challenges. the problem of endogeneity of residential location (in the form of ""selection bias"") has received perhaps the most attention in the literature (manski 1993) and is a paramount concern because families choose where to live in part based on the characteristics they value. thus' families who care more about investing in health-promoting activities may be less likely to choose to reside in a community with a poor health care system or high pollution. many of the multidimensional aspects that influence residential location decisions are cannot be easily measured' which makes it particularly difficult to disentangle the causal influences of a child's family' school' and neighborhood. few studies have used convincing identification strategies to overcome this challenge' exceptions being experimental evaluations such as katz' kling' and liebman (2001) and leventhal and brooks-gunn (2000). (see gennetian et al. in this volume.) other challenges also complicate attempts to examine causal effects of neighborhood context. one such challenge is the difficulty of obtaining accurate measures of neighborhood characteristics. another problematic characteristic of many neighborhood studies is that they examine the relationship between contemporaneous health and neighborhood conditions without regard to changing circumstances during the life cycle or the persistence of exposure to neighborhood conditions. if exposure to neighborhood conditions at an earlier stage of the life cycle influences current health but is not accounted for' then the estimated relationship between contemporaneous neighborhoods and health may be misleading. finally' causality between economic and health status runs in both directions in adulthood and has proven notoriously difficult to sort out empirically (adda' chandoln' and marmot 2003). by focusing on childhood socioeconomic conditions' we can more easily identify causal impacts on subsequent health because reverse causality is a relatively minor concern (i.e' poor child health is not a significant factor in most cases that leads to low parental income or neighborhood disadvantage). the studies highlighted in this chapter employ a different approach than those typically used to address these challenges by exploiting a unique feature of the panel study of income dynamics (psid). specifically' the initial psid sample in 1968 was highly clustered' with most original sample families having several other sample families living on the same block and who were subsequently followed over significant shares of the life course. this allows one to compare the similarity in adulthood health outcomes between siblings who grew up together versus unrelated individuals who grew up in the same narrowly defined neighborhood. estimating the overall scope of any such causal links of neighborhood environments is of substantial policy importance because the residential locations of both the poor and the affluent are influenced by public policies related to crime' subsidized housing' zoning' tax subsidies for home ownership' and school districting' among other things. moreover' understanding how the effects of neighborhood conditions differ over the life cycle is critical to helping policymakers develop interventions (e.g.' early childhood interventions or targeted policies for the geographic deconcentration of the poor) that build a bridge between childhood and early adulthood for impoverished families' so that fewer individuals arrive at the doorstep of retirement with accumulated exposures that are irreversible. in the next section' i provide an overview of the ways that neighborhoods' as well as families' may directly and indirectly affect an individual's health trajectory in adulthood and then summarize previous research on a number of topics relevant to my research. the third section lays out the methodological hurdles in estimating causal effects of neighborhood conditions' while the fourth summarizes recent research findings using innovative approaches that address these methodological challenges across a range of health outcomes over the life course. the final section discusses the policy implications and interventions that show the most promise to promote population health in order to build a more comprehensive and efficient health system. copyright © 2011 university of pennsylvania press. all rights reserved.","2010","johnson r.c.","neighborhood and life chances: how place matters in modern america",NA,NA,"18-36",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

"1253"," "," "," ","framing and gendering","the concept of framing is an essential component of the state feminism framework examined in the first part of this book, but it is not the central focus of the analysis. the aim of this chapter is to use information collected about the 130 policy debates from the rngs study to explore propositions about framing as an important strategy for political actors and, in doing so, contribute to the accumulation of knowledge about movements, framing, and policy in political science. there are several strands of interest. in the last decade, the struggle over definitions and meanings of public policy moved to the center of the study of democracies (gamson and meyer 1996). political ideas are not given; to the contrary, they are contested. therefore, society-based groups and state actors align themselves with definitions of policy issues that might reflect their positions and aims. political scientists have found that discourses, ideas, and frames are important sources of power. the struggle over their meaning (i.e., discursive politics) has increasingly become the focus of political analysis. this chapter considers different approaches to frame analysis and discursive policy analysis found in the fields of social and women's movement research (zald 1996; whittier 2002; kenney 2003; beckwith 2005; schoen and rein 1994; snow and benford 1992; kingdon 1995), discursive institutionalism (schmidt 2008), discursive policy analysis (fischer 2003; hajer and wage-naar 2003), and feminist policy research (bacchi 1999, 2005; ferree et al. 2002; squires 2005; verloo and lombardo 2007; lombardo, meier, and verloo 2009a). frames are ""organized ideas"" that provide at least some ""coherence to a designated set of elements"" (ferree et al. 2002: 105). framing organizes perceptions of social and political problems and gives meaning to specific situations and issues. in the studies of social movements, frames are seen as modes of defining problems and as structures of organized meanings (snow and benford 1992; gamson 1988). framing refers to the way in which actors define policy issues in terms of problems (diagnosis) and policy goals (prognosis) (benford and snow 2000; zald 1996). analysts agree that there is an important connection between the definition or framing of a policy problem and, eventually, policy outcomes (schattschneider 1960; kingdon 1995; cobb and elder 1983; schneider and ingram 1993; muller 1990). frames shape agenda-setting processes as well as decision making, and might also influence policy implementation. the opportunity to shape the overall idea of a policy gives power to collective actors from outside state institutions. they can, thus, insert their ideas into the policy process and realize their interests by changing the policy discourse and the underlying ideas in a specific policy environment in which the policy decisions are prepared. such a change in framing constitutes one form of process change because it brings ideas and interests of new groups into the policy discourse and changes substantive representation. moreover, outside actors are at the same time ""constructed"" as participants by the specific framing of an issue. in other words, a specific framing of an issue might mobilize collective action and allow these actors, and not others, to participate in a policy debate. thus, since framing might open the door to power for women's movements, it becomes a political strategy to gain substantive and descriptive representation. frames produce political action (benford and snow 2000: 631) and compose part of the cultural or discursive opportunity structure (burstein 1999; ferree et al. 2002). the cross-issue, cross-time, and cross-country analyses of this chapter seek to contribute to the fast-growing political science literature on framing by giving detailed empirical evidence on how women's movements and policies, as well as civil society and state, are connected through framing. as described more fully in chapter 2, the research plan of the rngs project discerns general frames, issue frames, and microframes. a general frame refers to wide-range definitions, that is, to a ""universe of political discourse"" (jenson 1989), or what bob jessop (1994) calls the ""state project,"" for instance, the ""welfare state."" gender equality might be such a wide general frame of the women's movement (lombardo, meier, and verloo 2009a). the issue frame is the meaning of a specific policy area, used by actors in this specific policy subsystem in a specific policy debate, such as employment, health, or environment policy. typical issue frames in abortion debates, for example, are health frames; in prostitution debates, we find crime frames. such frames can be welcoming to the women's movement activists' ideas, or they can be hostile. a microframe is the position that specific actors, both inside and outside of the state (e.g., bureaucratic agencies, political parties, interest groups, and women's movements) seek to insert into the issue frame to change the definition of the issue and policy content. microframes express discourses and ideas of individuals or organizations. individuals and organizations in women's movements are such actors who, with their microframes, attempt to weigh into the debates at the level of the policy subsystem. the concept of state feminism used in this book places certain aspects of framing as indicators as well as drivers of women's movement success and agency effectiveness. for example, movement success is defined as the compatibility of policy content with movement microframes expressed in the debate. the compatibility of ideas of women's movement actors who take a position in a debate with the frames that characterize the given policy environment is explored as a central explanatory factor in the success of women's movements. moreover, it is shown, in part ii of the book, that the role of women's policy agencies in mediating between women's movements and the policy environments may also be crucial-namely, the gendering or de-gendering of an issue by the agencies in a way that the perceptions of the issue by policy actors coincide with the movement frames in the debate (also see ferree and gam-son 2003). women's policy agencies that effectively insert women's movement frames into policy debates are influential in enhancing movement state feminism in two respects: they facilitate the entry of women's movement actors in the policy arena, and they shape the policy outcome according to the women's movements ideas and goals. alliances between women's movements and women's policy agencies are likely to occur through an agreement on frames-that is, on the definition of the policy issue at stake and on the vision of the policy solution. the state feminism framework also assumes that gendered issue frames help to put the aims of women's movement actors on the political agenda and that the gendering of an issue is important for the substantive and descriptive success of the women's movement. the major assumption is that frames are the ""glue"" to policy change, for the participation of women's movement actors, and for state feminism. the framing of a policy issue is a way to enhance the likelihood that women's movement actors will be able to change the content of a policy and to bring forward the quantitative representation of women in a policy arena. this chapter seeks to fill in the blanks relating to the content of women's movement framing in the rngs policy debates, classifying the content of microframes expressed by women's movement actors.1 then it uses information from the rngs dataset to examine changes in issue frames and their relation to women's policy agency frames. while the role of framing is widely acknowledged in the political science literature, not much systematic empirical research has been conducted on the influence of frames in a policy process in which women's movements were involved. the first section investigates in detail how these frames attempt to gender policies in the issues of abortion, job training, prostitution, political representation, and hot issues of state restructuring over the last three decades. did the frames change over time? are there country-specific patterns of frames? do clusters of countries exist that show commonalities in framing a specific policy issue and across the five issues? are there specific groups of frames that shape specific issues? case studies will show how women's movement actors brought issues onto the agenda by strategic framing of policy problems. second, the chapter looks at patterns of the issue frames of policy actors. given that changes in issue frames are an indication of cultural change inside the state, it explores patterns in the frames over time and whether cultural change toward gender equality has occurred. is there cross-country variation in framing issues? to what extent were women's movements able to change frames in policy debates over time? what leads to a gendered or de-gendered issue frame? the third section examines the important nexus between women's movement microframes and policy actors' issue frames. the data on the congruence of these types of frames suggest factors that might explain the likelihood that women's movements microframes will be compatible with the frames used by policy actors and, thus, be more welcome in a specific policy environment. finally, the chapter submits the major assumptions of the state feminism framework to empirical analysis. are these assumptions warranted by the data from the debates? © 2010 by temple university press. all rights

"1254"," "," "," ","predictive models of dissocial behavior by sex in two popular neighborhoods modelos predictivos de conducta disocial por sexos en dos colonias populares","introduction: although the characteristics of the adolescent stage favor the emergence of disruptive behaviors, not all adolescents engage in them in equal degree. for the majority of adolescents, the problematic behaviors are limited to an experimentation period and are temporary. however, for some individuals, the first contacts with the disruptive behavior progress to more severe antisocial behavior patterns. the progression of the dissocial behavior from the childhood to the adolescence seems related to a difficult temperament, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, improper relationships with peers, precocious sexuality, poor parent-adolescent communication, arrests by delinquency and repetition. traditionally, the dissocial behavior has been associated with low socioeconomic status, lack of public services, unemployment, marginalization and schools with unsuitable educational programs. however, current conceptualizations view this problem as much more complex. in communities that have covered the basic needs, even in those that possess a good quality of life, we can find children and adolescents with dissocial behavior that thereinafter become adults with antisocial personality. therefore, during the last decades, research has displaced its attention from the structural variables to community (lack of attachment with the vicinity, social mobility, and population density), family (bonding, communication, supervision) and personal processes, favoring a biopsychosocial perspective to this problem. the aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model of dissocial behavior (as defined by the 27-item dissocial behavior scale, ecodi27) based on the following predictor variables: a) parent communication (parent-adolescent communication scale, pacs), b) empathy (interpersonal relationship index, iri), c) assertiveness (rathus assertiveness schedule, ras), d) sensation seeking (sensation seeking scale - form v, sss-v) and e) risk socialization (social relationship questionnaire, srq, created for this study) controlling for the impression management effect (balanced inventory of desirable responding-version 6, bidr-6). method: a probability sample of adolescents, 14 to 17 years of age, living in two neighborhoods with high indexes of gangs and offenses was collected. males were 112 and women 86, without statistical difference of frequencies (χ2 [1,n=196]=3.41, p=.06). all participants resided in san nicolas de los garza, nuevo leon, mexico. pearson's productmoment correlation, partial correlation and stepwise linear regression were used for data analysis. results: there was a significant difference in dissocial behavior cases between male and female adolescents (χ2 [1,n=194]=14.75, p<.00), with yates' correction: (χ2 [1,n=194]=12.59, p<.01). the percentage of cases is 18% in women and 45% in men. the total score of the 27-item dissocial behavior scale (ecodi27) presented significant correlation with social desirability (.47 in men and .44 in women) and its factor of impression management (.53 in men and .47 in women). the self-deception factor was independent in men (r=.18, p=.06), but not in women (r=.26, p=.02). higher dissocial behavior features were associated with lower scores on social desirability and its factors. the effect of the impression management factor had to be controlled for its statistical significance in men and women. of the 18 variables of the social relationships questionnaire (srq) by the point-biserial correlation coefficient (dichotomic variables) and pearson's product-moment correlation (ordinal and numerical variables), only four were significantly correlated to the ecodi27 total score: to belong (1) or not (2) to a gang outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.45, p<.01) and in the school (n=133, rpb=.35, p<.01), to have 1) or not 2) a friend group outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.20, p=.01), as well as to have 1) or not 2) a girlfriend or boyfriend in the school (n=131, rpb=.26, p=.02) and outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.18, p=.01). these correlations were positive, that is to say, acted as risk factors (lower score on ecodi27, more dissocial behavior). the variable of risk socialization was created with the sum of these five variables, giving more weight to the two variables of gangs by their higher correlations, so they are multiplied by two. the created variable has a range of 0 (not risk) to 7 (high risk). of the 20 variables contemplated, nine presented significant correlation with dissocial behavior in men, after partializing the effect of the impression management: sensation seeking and its four factors (disinhibition, excitement seeking, emotion seeking and boredom susceptibility), risk socialization, total and open communication with the father and perspective taking. in women there were also nine significant variables: risk socialization, sensation seeking and its factors of disinhibition, boredom susceptibility and excitement seeking, total and open communication with the mother, total communication with the father and school grade. the regression models by sexes were calculated with the nine variables whose correlations with the ecodi27 total score resulted significant after partializing impression management. in men the calculation process ended in the fifth step. the model explained 49% of the variance of the ecodi27 total score and was significant (f [5,106]=21.99, p<.01). five variables integrated the model: disinhibition (β=-.32), risk socialization (β=-.28), open communication with the father (β=.27), excitement seeking (β=-.20) and perspective taking (β=.16). in women the calculation process ended in the third step. the model explained 40% of the variance of the criterion and was significant (f [3,78]=19.38, p<.01). three variables integrated it: total communication with the mother (β=.33), risk socialization (β=-32) and sensation seeking (β=-.28). conclusions: the results of the present study can only be extrapolated to the population of the two studied neighborhoods and must be handled as generators of testable hypotheses in other similar populations. in addition, their self-report nature must be considered as an additional potential limitation. however, they indicate that the presence of dissocial behavior was high in the present sample, with an intermediate percentage (33%) between high school students (8.5%) and imprisoned offenders (50%). risk socialization (engaging in gangs, friend group in the neighborhood and precocious sexuality), sensation seeking and little communication with the parent or tutor of the same sex than adolescent in men and women, as well as lack of perspective taking in men, were predictors of dissocial behavior. the sensation seeking was defined in the regression models by the sss total score in women and by its factors of disinhibition and excitement seeking in men. these data make an attention call to the council authorities of a propitiatory environment for dissocial behavior. from the obtained models, the intervention must be addressed to eradicate the phenomenon of the gangs; to encourage the internal control or planning and perspective taking in the pupils, through specific workshops within the school subjects of ethic or health care. they also call for the importance to work the open communication, above all with the parent or tutor of the same sex than the adolescent, through these workshops as well as during the meetings with the pupil's parents. furthermore, to seek occupational-formative opportunities for those adolescents that have left the school seems critical, especially for those of 16-year-old or younger, considering the prohibition of working at that age.","2011","de la rubia j.m.; ortiz morales h.o.","salud mental","34","3","227-235",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

"1262"," "," "," ","understanding segregation processes","there is growing consensus that living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty increases the likelihood of social problems such as teenage parenthood, drug and alcohol use, crime victimization, and chronic unemployment. neighborhood inequality is also implicated in studies of enduring race/ethnic health disparities, and there are recent moves to broaden the definition of health care policy to policies targeting social inequality (mechanic 2007). residential segregation affects health outcomes in several different ways. first, income, education, and occupation are all strongly related to health (adler and newman 2002). segregation is a key mechanism through which socioeconomic inequality is perpetuated and reinforced, as it hinders the upward mobility of disadvantaged groups by limiting their educational and employment opportunities. second, segregation increases minority exposure to unhealthy neighborhood environments. residential segregation creates areas with concentrated poverty and unemployment, both of which are key factors that predict violence and create racial differences in homicide (samson and wilson 1995). neighborhood characteristics, such as exposure to environmental hazards, fear of violence, and access to grocery stores, affect health risks and health behaviors (cheadle et al. 1991). tobacco and alcohol industries also advertise their products disproportionately in poor, minority areas (moore, williams, and qualls 1996). finally, residential segregation leads to inequalitie in health care resources, which contributes to disparities in quality of treatment (smedley, stith, and nelson 2002). one strategy for reducing health disparities among ethnic groups, particularly among blacks and whites, would be to reduce or eliminate racial residential segregation and the corresponding geographic concentration of poverty. currently, we have a number of programs in place that are designed, directly or indirectly, to affect the socio-demographic characteristics of neighborhoods (e.g., fha low-income mortgage loans, hope vi mixed income housing developments, and section 8 housing vouchers). however, despite almost a century of neighborhood research, social scientists do not know what forces maintain segregation, what the respective strengths of these forces are, or how they combine. in the absence of theoretical and empirical knowledge of how segregation works, it is difficult to effectively evaluate the short-run effectiveness of policies, let alone their long-run equilibrium consequences. moreover, without some understanding of the global impact of these housing policies, interventions may be ineffective, or worse yet produce unintended consequences that exacerbate problems of concentrated poverty. examples of unintended consequences include the exploding crime rates in mid-sized cities which have been linked to the anti-poverty programs hope iv and section 8 (see rosin 2008; galster 2003; bostic and lee 2008). neighborhood formation and change is one example of a process in which collective dynamics emerge from the behavior of individual agents, mediated through interaction and aggregation. people who exit a neighborhood because they cannot tolerate its ethnic composition are both responding to and modifying neighborhood ethnic composition. this leads to a ""spiral"" or ""domino effect"" whereby small changes in neighborhood composition amplify and result in unexpected and extreme segregation. this is true even when people have relatively mild preferences for their own group (schelling 1971, 1978). a number of health problems share these features of dynamic interdependence and feedback, including the spread of obesity, the development of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis and staph infections, and the recent increase in hiv infection rates following the development of more effective antiviral treatments (see la berge 2008; elford 2006; fong and drlica 2003; palumbi 2001; lightfoot et al. 2005). existing methods for studying this type of process have not been successful in developing effective mechanisms for change. such processes have been dubbed ""policy resistant,"" as attempts at interventions often fail due to the response of the system to the intervention (sterman 2006). my work blends empirical, analytic, and computational methods in an effort to develop a body of theoretical knowledge and corresponding agent-based model that can identify a few mechanisms central to maintaining segregated neighborhoods. the model incorporates information about how individuals discover and evaluate potential destinations, the relationship between decisions about where to live and aggregate patterns of segregation, and an understanding of how policies aimed at reducing segregation affect mobility behavior. the research is iterative, with model validation providing clues into what might be misspecified or missing from the behavioral or agent-based models, resulting adjustments of the behavioral and agent-based models, and subsequent reevaluation. provided the agent-based model can reproduce key features of neighborhood turnover in different cities, my hope is that it will be useful in the development and evaluation of alternative policies for reducing segregation. along the way, the model will provide useful information including how people respond to their environment under conditions of change and uncertainty, the relationship between mobility patterns, economic inequalities among ethic groups, and racial segregation, how segregation dynamics scale with population size, and the effect of government interventions such as public housing and housing vouchers on mobility patterns and the housing market. © springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2010.","2010","bruch e.","lecture notes in computer science (including subseries lecture notes in artificial intelligence and lecture notes in bioinformatics)","6007 lncs",NA,"42-43","10.1007/978-3-642-12079-4_7","Scopus"," "," "
"1263"," "," "," ","regional homicide patterns in brazil","brazil is one of the most violent countries in all of latin america; indeed, it is one of the most violent countries in one of the most violent regions in the world. this is undoubtedly a key challenge for brazilian development because it has a direct impact on economic and political life, contributes to the deterioration of and limits access to public health and education services, and greatly reduces employment opportunities for those living in high-risk areas. one of the most noxious effects of violence is that the climate of fear and distrust it generates limits people's freedom, restricting mobility in certain urban areas, rendering ineffective self and external policing mechanisms. and the effect on family life is devastating: violence has led to the breakdown of thousands of homes. this chapter looks at homicide in brazil, using accumulated data covering large areas and population. various studies have attempted to explain why rates of violent crime vary between cities, metropolitan areas, or states, and have correlated such variations with social, demographic, and economic variables.1 a study of homicide in the u.s., for instance, lists the following factors, starting with the most important: high economic disparities or inequality, population structures and density (the larger areas with the densest population have the highest homicide rates), and high unemployment rates.2 various authors have tested the idea that socioeconomic inequality in specific areas, regions, and cities helps to explain the distribution of homicide rates in brazil. they have pointed to the relevance of economic cycles,3 poverty,4 and income and other economic variables related to inequality or investment in public safety at the city level.5 the central role of firearms in violence in brazil is alarming. according to international comparisons of firearm deaths undertaken by the world health organization, which take total population into account,6 out of twenty-two ranked countries brazil comes second in the number of homicides caused by firearms and first in juvenile firearm deaths. international data indicate not only the extremely high level of lethal violence in brazil (over 70 percent of homicides were committed with firearms, as compared with around 10 percent for the other countries in the group), but also the predominance of the use of firearms in the resolution of conflicts. research and studies about the regional determinants of firearm deaths allow us to understand better the demand for and potential benefits of national and regional policies to control firearms and ammunition effectively, and to reduce legal and black market supply and demand. thus, the aim of this chapter is to look at the incidence of homicides committed with firearms and to examine the extent to which regional variations can explain variations in the homicide rate. for the period 1980-2000, the relevant regional variations include cultural traits and patterns of conflict and control specific to each region. however, rather than using the ""subcultures of violence"" argument,7 the chapter looks at theories of social disorganization and control.8 one can analyze regions with historically high rates of firearm homicides in light of social disorganization resulting from land disputes where there are no formal con trol mechanisms. in such contexts, the resolution of conflicts through honor and traditional social behavior patterns replace formal and informal control mechanisms.9 curiously, these patterns emerge also in metropolitan areas, particularly those dominated by armed groups that are fighting for territorial control of urban centers. looking at rates of homicide is, then, a way of understanding the diversity of experiences in brazil. we have yet to take into account the level of diversity of experiences within large urban centers. the phenomenon most closely associated with the rise of homicides in brazil is urbanization. strictly speaking, it can be said that, as in other countries, violent crime is an urban phenomenon associated with processes of disorganization and the deterioration of control mechanisms in brazilian urban centers.10 there are various competing theories about the links between homicide and urban dynamics. one pioneering theory proposed by the chicago school is the so-called social disorganization theory. it analyses different territories within cities and the association between social disorganization and violence, transition zones and criminality, and urban violence and youth.11 this disorganization was observed in some areas of cities in the u.s., where the absence or decadence of traditional values was a cause of moral and family crisis, which in turn led to criminality. such territories became sui generis regions of sorts, in which social order was not clearly defined. conflicts emerge, then, in deteriorated communities, characterized by constant changes in the population and intense mobility. in other words, these are areas lacking any kind of infrastructure. together, these facts led to a transition process culminating in criminal activities by adolescent gangs. these gangs are part of the poverty belt of communities constituted by people who live in a socioeconomic ""transition zone."" the theory of social disorganization, for instance, assumes that delinquency is a group rather than an individual phenomenon, and that community social disorganization makes it hard to control youth groups. another interpretation is proposed by strain theory, which assumes that deviance is the result of pressures caused by social structure. it is classified as a ""systematic approach of social and cultural sources of a nonconformist behavior."" 12 the emphasis that society places on cultural objectives can, and frequently is, much greater than the attention focused on means that the cultural targets recognize as socially valid. we have then a polarizing system, which varies the emphases on these two moments; balance would correspond to a situation in which the social satisfactions provided adjust to both pressures. merton, for instance, argues that delinquency emerges when it is impossible to attain socially expected levels of consumption. the gap between aspirations, inflated in a consumer society, and achievements, limited by inequality and poverty, are the main explanation for crime. subcultural13 and learning theories,14 on the other hand, argue that deviance and crime are social or cultural products that do not necessarily emerge as a result of disorganized social structures, but rather as a result of the division of society into different groups which pursue their own goals-goals that are set independently of the mainstream or dominant culture. once the use of violence has been normatively indicated, the counter-norm will be nonviolence. the individual that belongs to a community where violence is the established means to resolve conflicts will be ostracized or treated with indifference if they do not use violence ""appropriately. "" this kind of social pressure foments adherence to subcultural values in which aggression is considered the usual means to deal with conflict. the hypothesis is that the open use of violence is part of a normative subcultural system which has ramifications on the individual psyche. thus, the individual is forced to behave according to the norms of the social group to which they belong. further, in addition to being socialized according to established standards, behavior is submitted to various types of control. on the one hand, the group makes a certain kind of behavior possible, promoting the acquisition of abilities, values, expectations, and objectives; and on the other hand, the group makes the individual behave in a suitable manner. criminal or delinquent behavior is the result of belonging to a social group in both senses. in contrast with theories in which crime is seen as a consequence of poorly integrated or collapsed systems, in social control theory, crime is a consequence of failed mechanisms of social control, in turn the result of conjunctural crisis or imperative tendencies in modern society.15 theories of social control emphasize the role of the family, school, religion, and other institutions in the prevention of crime in general and in juvenile delinquency in particular. crime and delinquency are linked to the failure of the institutions responsible for the social control, so that researchers focus on incomplete families, the absence of parental orientation, or school truancy, among other such factors. these factors should be studied together with learning and socialization theories on the basis of the notion, crudely put, that ""family, school, and church"" teach citizenship, while ""the streets"" teach crime and delinquency. these theories are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, socioeconomic factors are a feature they all share. the empirical data used to confirm this hypothesis covers brazil as a whole, five regions, twenty-six states and their respective capitals, and the federal district. the population data used here is gathered from the official site of the brazilian health ministry.16 data on homicides are from the health ministry's mortality information system. these data cover the period between 1980 and 2002. the information is coded according to the international disease classification (idc), revision ix (for 1980-1995), and revision x (for 1996-2002). copyright © 2009 by university of notre dame.","2009","beato c.c.; marinho f.c.","criminality, public security, and the challenge to democracy in latin america",NA,NA,"27-46",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

(2) economic factors are, for the most part, weakly associated with immigrant location decisions. (3) immigrants appear to be more attracted to states with large (growing) populations; less attracted to states with a high proportion of other foreign-born persons; more attracted to states with high unionization, and less attracted to states with high crime.

"1284"," "," "," ","kim jong il and north korea the leader and the system","much hyperbole surrounds the political regime in the democratic people's republic of korea (dprk, or north korea). many analysts argue that north korea is a unique political system. what kind of regime is the dprk, and what kind of leader does it have? a variety of labels are given to the north korean regime. these include likening the regime to an organized crime family and to a corporatist organism. there are certainly merits to each of these approaches, but each has its limitations. pyongyang does share some of the attributes of organized crime and certainly engages in criminal activity in a systematic and calculating manner. this pattern of illicit behavior includes the production and distribution of narcotics as well as the counterfeiting of foreign currencies, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. but the dprk is more than a crime family-it possesses a massive conventional military force as well as significant strategic forces. moreover, the regime continues to brainwash, imprison, or starve north koreans, inflicting untold misery and death on its people. corporatism, meanwhile, may provide insights into certain aspects of the system, but its utility is limited by the confusion that surrounds understanding of this concept. certainly north korea is distinct politically, but it also has significant commonalities with various regime types and authority structures. pyongyang is a highly centralized and militarized bureaucratic regime organized around an all-powerful leader. this monograph examines the leader and the system, and identifies the regime type. the author contends that the north korean political system is best conceived as a totalitarian regime that, although weakened, remains remarkably resilient. after analyzing the key elements of totalitarianism, he argues that the system's greatest test will probably come after the death of kim jong il. while the totalitarian regime may not long survive kim's passing, one cannot assume that the system will collapse. rather, the end of totalitarianism may simply mean that the dprk will enter a new ""post-totalitarian"" phase similar to the paths taken by other communist systems such as the soviet union and china. while the latter term may be a good fit to describe china's political system in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, it seems inaccurate to describe north korea. north korea has not undergone any process of ""de- kimification"": kim il sung remains a deity in 21st century north korea and criticism or reappraisal is unthinkable. moreover, no one has contemplated criticizing or challenging his legacy because, by all accounts, he remains universally revered by dprk citizens, including defectors. furthermore, any official reevaluation of kim il sung is extremely unlikely because the regime is currently led by kim's son. the most accurate way to characterize north korea today is as an eroding totalitarian regime. while totalitarianism is a powerful and intimidating system, it places tremendous strain on a state and a society-demanding constant activity and mobilization of personnel and exploitation of resources. the costs of maintaining heightened ideological indoctrination, an ever-vigilant coercive apparatus, and a large national defense organization are high and ultimately debilitating. to maintain this for decades results in fatigue and burnout. eventually leaders and followers reach a point where both are physically and mentally exhausted, and the country's infrastructure and resources become devastated. north korea's elite and ordinary people appear to be approaching this point. but this fatigue and burnout does not appear to produce much in the way of protest or dissent, let alone revolt; most likely the majority of people in north korea are simply too tired to do much more than focus their time and energy on providing for the basic needs of their families. an absolute dictator still rules the regime. while the regime continues to hold a monopoly of the instruments of coercion, there has been some slippage or erosion in the defining features of totalitarianism. first of all, kim jong il, although he is virtually an absolute dictator, appears to take into account the opinions of others the way his father did not. and ideology no longer appears to be so focused on transforming the state and society and more on the instrumental goals of economic recovery, development, and firming up regime power. while a condition of terror remains palpable, it is no longer all pervasive, and individuals are able to navigate or circumvent the system without fearing that they face dire consequences. as a result of the shift in ideology and alleviation of the climate of terror, the regime has become ""corrupted"" literally as bribery is rampant, and figuratively as the regime seeks to preserve its power and status. meanwhile, the stalinist centrally planned economy has been seriously eroded, and the monopoly of mass communication has loosened significantly. the regime has attempted to repair the latter two elements, but it is not clear to what extent this will be successful. the regime appears to be stable and not on the brink of collapse. while it is difficult to speculate about the longevity of north korea as a political entity, it is more manageable to forecast the future of totalitarianism in the dprk. totalitarian regimes rarely endure longer than several decades and almost never survive the passing of the absolute dictator. in fact, pyongyang is unique in that it is the only totalitarian regime to weather a leadership transition (from kim il sung to kim jong il). indeed, north korea is the world's ""longest lasting totalitarian regime, having spanned some 4 decades and surviving generational leadership succession."" perhaps none of the numerous challenges the regime faces is more daunting than the succession question. kim has probably at most 10-15 years in which to pave the way for one of his offspring to succeed him. if he lives long enough, it is possible he could be successful. what is less likely is that totalitarianism could survive another leadership transition. at some point, the totalitarian regime will simply collapse or weaken to the extent that it becomes a posttotalitarianism system. possibly the clearest indication of the status and fate of pyongyang's totalitarian regime over the next 10 years or so will come in how the arrangements for the succession to kim jong il are handled. is there evidence that a particular individual is being groomed to succeed kim? the answer appears to be ""yes."" some other key indicators to monitor are signs of dissent among elites and masses, especially fissures that might occur within the party or military. by carefully charting trends, observers can make it less likely that they will be caught off guard by the actions of north korea's leader or changes in its political system. © 2008 by nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved.","2011","scobell a.","the kim jong il regime in north korea",NA,NA,"1-37",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

"1286"," "," "," ","patterns and issues in the latinization of allentown pennsylvania","this chapter has addressed several issues related to the latinization of allentown, pa. the research was framed around five general sets of questions, to which we now return in this summary. the first issue was concerned with migration to (and population change in) allentown. we illustrated that allentown experienced a dramatic demographic shift between 1980 and 2000, and that the population of the city is now about 25 percent latino (of which 67 percent is puerto rican). the growth of the latino population is largely due to in-migration of latinos from the new york city area and from other origins in the northeast and overseas. many latinos stated that their reason for moving to allentown was for job opportunities. others had different reasons, such as marriage and family reasons, tranquility and safety, housing costs, and the ability to purchase a home. second, we were concerned with questions of latino settlement patterns in allentown. we showed that latinos are highly segregated from anglos in the allentown area. one way to understand the relatively high level of latino-white segregation in the metro region is to examine allentown in relation to lehigh county. in 2000, approximately 82 percent of lehigh county latinos resided within the city of allentown. in the same year, approximately 73 percent of all latinos resided within 1.5 miles of its original settlement area, the intersection of second and linden streets. we concluded that rather than social assimilation tied to spatial assimilation, by 2000 latinos were merely replacing white, non-hispanics in a more sequent occupance mode. the third issue that we explored in the latinization of allentown had to do with anglo and latino perceptions. drawing on stains (1994) work we demonstrated that anglos were concerned with latinos brandishing a ""big apple attitude"" and being indiscrete, boisterous, and loitering, as well as having an association with crime, gangs and drugs. there was a fear among some anglos that the latino influence was a threat to women and children. to gain some sense of latino perceptions of allentown, we conducted interviews and asked how fairly treated they felt in a number of different circumstances. the majority of our interviewees felt fairly treated by anglos in the areas about which they were questioned. for example, 70 percent indicated that they received fair treatment by their anglo neighbors. there are different experiences however, and some latinos felt that many anglos simply do not like hispanic people and unfairly associate all hispanics with crime and the drug culture of allentown. the most common perception of anglo treatment was related to social distance. another area of concern in this chapter had to do with employment and fair treatment in the regional labor market. we found, from our interviews, that the place of employment was where latinos felt the least fairly treated. structural issues, such as spatial mismatch between residence and employment, the existence of a dual labor market, and unemployment, were also examined. u.s. census data illustrated a spatial mismatch between latinos' residential location and places of employment. the mismatch might be at least partly responsible for higher unemployment rates among latinos. in addition, we found that a dual labor market exists in allentown with latinos (especially males) concentrated in secondary occupations. finally, we illustrated with photographs that a latino ethnoscape is becoming increasingly apparent in the city of allentown. we concentrated on two major cultural identifiers, religion and food, to show how the cultural landscape of the city is changing. the religious landscape is being modified through the establishment of ""storefront"" churches and the language change from english to spanish in formerly all-anglo congregations. the grocery industry has changed in a variety of ways in allentown. first, was the appearance of the latino (dominican) owned bodega. second, anglo-owned chain grocery stores began to offer produce and other items to cater to latino tastes. the most recent change has been the opening of c-town, a latino (dominican)-owned chain store based in new york city. in both cases, religion and food, latinos have brought their culture with them to allentown and it is becoming clearly imprinted on the landscape. between 1980 and 2000, the latino population of allentown has quadrupled. although the puerto rican population is the largest latino group in the city, the latino population is very diverse; there are substantial numbers of mexicans and dominicans living in allentown. the rapid pace of the latino influx would have strained the social fabric anywhere, but the strain has the potential to be particularly acute where it upsets the germanic (pennsylvania dutch) sense of order in small cities like allentown. many questions arise concerning the link between these population shifts and what it means for the future of small cities. as cities continue to search for methods to deal with dwindling budgets and increased competition in attracting highly selective and mobile capital, the probability of growing urban isolation and inequality by racial and ethnic groups should undoubtedly be viewed as a social problem on the rise. © 2010 state university of new york. all rights reserved.","2010","reisinger m.e.;

"1291"," "," "," ","segregation urban","segregation refers to the degree to which social groups are spatially, and, by implication, socially separated from one another. related to this concept is the extent to which people in an area, such as a neighborhood, have similar social characteristics. such characteristics have tended to be empirically measured in terms of ethnicity or social class. this is largely because cities, predominantly in the us, have shown tendencies to separate social groups by income and race following riots in the late 1960s, social housing policies and suburbanization by higher-income groups. a key question, related to issues of segregation, is whether the spatial separation of social groups is a problem in its own right (wherein, living in a poor or socially homogeneous area may reinforce poor life chances) or whether these patterns are also symptomatic of deeper social problems and prejudices. much of the research literature on segregation has assumed, in any case, that it forms a significant social and urban problem, but it has generally been difficult to identify commonly agreed-upon measures of its prevalence and impact. these various issues relate to a number of conceptual problems, as well as the availability of adequate data. in contemporary western urban contexts, segregation has continued to be a prominent feature of city life which reflects, in part, not only the rising income inequalities but also a fear of crime and social difference. in countries such as the uk segregation has deepened around income, rather than ethnic, lines, while in the us it would seem that both income and ethnicity are important in explaining patterns of spatial clustering by particular social groups. an emerging research issue has been to acknowledge that patterns of residential segregation, essentially measures representations of social life contained in neighborhoods, may usefully be supplemented by an understanding of patterns of mobility and separation within and between areas. thus, we now acknowledge dynamic forms of social separation wherein like-with-like social association may occur in social networks across space as well as within the neighborhood context. © 2009 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.","2009","atkinson r.; mcgarrigle j.","international encyclopedia of human geography",NA,NA,"76-80","10.1016/b978-008044910-4.01101-9","Scopus"," "," "
"1292"," "," "," ","the paradox of minimal effects","central to the study of campaigns and elections lies a paradox. voters rely heavily on the information conveyed by campaigns in order to form judgments about who should govern. by most accounts, citizens in modern democracies know little about and feel distant from public affairs. most people tune in during political campaigns, and what they see and hear can influence their opinions considerably, as shown by recent research on individual voting behavior (ansolabehere and iyengar 1995; bartels 1993; jacobson 1990; johnston et al.1992; popkin 1991; zaller 1992) and on aggregate voting patterns (bartels 1987; brady and johnston 1987; jacobson 1980, 1990). it should, thus, be hard to anticipate the outcomes of elections without knowing how the media cover the elections, what themes the candidates stress, which candidates advertise the most, and what is said during conventions and debates. election outcomes are strongly predicted, however, by forces outside of campaign politics. evidence from an extensive literature on economics and elections shows that the governing party's reelection depends overwhelmingly on whether the country is prosperous at home and at peace abroad.1 campaigns seem to be inessential to understanding who wins and who loses. the 1988 presidential election perhaps best exempliaes this puzzle. to many political scientists the 1988 presidential election represented an analytical triumph. george bush won with nearly exactly the vote predicted by a simple model in which the vote is predicted by the percentage change in real personal disposable income.2 the lots of george bush and michael dukakis, it seems, were drawn by the economic fates. but bush did not win with ease. throughout the campaign the polls buctuated dramatically, suggesting that large fractions of the electorate made up their minds in the months, even days, leading up to election day (gelman and king 1993). michael dukakis even held a substantial lead in the polls late in the summer of 1988. observers of the campaigns argue that dukakis was brought down not by the sudden realization of many voters that the economy was doing well but by the themes and strategies of the competing campaigns. the republicans' messages of crime, patriotism, and conservatism resonated well with the public, while the democratic campaign lost its focus after the primaries. bush used attack advertisements and the free media with cunning and success, while dukakis refused to slug back (germond and witcover 1989; jamieson 1992). such factors are nowhere to be found in the macropolitical models. even still, those models worked smashingly well, though in the end they looked a lot like voodoo political economics. how is it that elections are highly predictable when voters rely heavily on what they see and hear in a particular campaign? the obvious, most common, and probably correct response is that the public discourse observed during campaigns confirms what most people privately believe about the state of the country and the political parties and candidates. beginning with paul lazarsfeld's important studies of the elections of 1944 and 1948, social scientists have argued that campaigns reinforce the political orientations of voters and mobilize them to vote rather than convert large segments of the population to new ways of thinking or new patterns of behavior (berelson, lazarsfeld, and mcphee 1954; key 1966; campbell 1960). recent social science research has further refined our understanding of reinforcement. the stylized facts that emerge from this research are that campaign communications are reinforcing for different groups within the electorate, depending on their partisan orientation and prior levels of information and interest (zaller 1992). partisans, especially low information partisans, seem to be particularly susceptible to messages from their own party's candidates. partisans seem resistant to messages that are sponsored by the opposing party or that favor the opposing party. nonpartisans seem to behave somewhat differently. low information nonpartisans seem to tune out political messages of all sort, but the high information nonpartisans seem to be particularly influenced by political communications.3 but there is a fundamental problem with reinforcement arguments. people seem to throw away the public information that campaigns produce, or they use it inefficiently or not at all. why would people use information this way? do people just fool themselves? two sorts of explanations of the reinforcing effects of campaigns are commonly expressed. first, political psychologists argue that these effects arise because people use cognitive shortcuts, such as priming, cognitive dissonance, and acceptability biases. as a result, individuals believe information that agrees with their beliefs and ignore information dissonant with their beliefs (iyengar and kinder 1987; popkin 1991; zaller 1992). by this account, elections are predictable because individuals hear what they want to hear, which is consistent with their private assessments of the economy. second, political economists and many political scientists argue that people use their private information and discount publicly provided information, such as news and ads, because it is not as credible or as reliable as each individual's personal and private experiences (downs 1957; key 1966; fiorina 1981). by this account elections are predictable because aggregate indicators of national well-being are the sum of many individual experiences, and the political campaigns matter little to those judgments. each explanation has complementary strengths and weaknesses. psychological accounts emphasize the importance of public information, such as ads and news, that all people see. these arguments arise out of attempts to understand the ups and downs that occur during elections, as many of the essays in this volume attest. psychological explanations, though, have difficulty explaining the behavior of key groups within the electorate. in the advertising case, it is hard to think of a priming or framing story that explains the behavior of both partisans and independents and in particular why high information independents appear to move in the direction of the sponsor of the ads. finally, these stories imply an eventual convergence of beliefs that is rarely observed. if all information were truly public and common, then over time we would observe complete consensus in public opinion on topics where all people agree about the objectives, such as greater economic growth or presidential job approval. economic explanations emphasize private information and provide a coherent way to understand why people have different beliefs and preferences. individuals' beliefs and preferences are rooted in their disparate experiences in the economy and with the government, parties, and specific politicians. however, such explanations discount the publicly conveyed information. this hardly seems consistent with the basic conjectures of rational choice, namely, that individuals make decisions in the most efficient (lowest cost) way or with empirical reality (erikson et al. 2003). economic man seems consistent with the observed predictability of elections but not with the variation that occurs during campaigns. this essay offers a simple theory of campaign information and learning that is entirely consistent with the basic observations made in empirical research. i build on the insights of political psychologists that campaigns fundamentally involve public information and of political economists that individuals' beliefs and preferences derive considerably from their private experiences and information. i assume that people use all information and that they value it equally. it is the mix of the public information from campaigns and the private information from personal experiences that creates the dynamics social scientists have observed. private information generates heterogeneity in people's beliefs; public information creates coordinated shifts in those beliefs, which look identical to the patterns observed in survey data and experiments. the account offered here raises what i consider to be a very important set of methodological concerns in the study of campaigns. what is an adequate model of voter reasoning and behavior? the intellectual move made here is to introduce public as well as private information into a simple model of economic voting and to show that many of the basic individual level behavioral changes can be understood in these terms. © 2006 by university of michigan press. all rights reserved.","2006","ansolabehere s.","capturing campaign effects",NA,NA,"29-44",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

"1301"," "," "," ","the problems of relative deprivation why some societies do better than others","in this paper, we present evidence which suggests that key processes of social status differentiation, affecting health and numerous other social outcomes, take place at the societal level. understanding them seems likely to involve analyses and comparisons of whole societies. using income inequality as an indicator and determinant of the scale of socioeconomic stratification in a society, we show that many problems associated with relative deprivation are more prevalent in more unequal societies. we summarise previously published evidence suggesting that this may be true of morbidity and mortality, obesity, teenage birth rates, mental illness, homicide, low trust, low social capital, hostility, and racism. to these we add new analyses which suggest that this is also true of poor educational performance among school children, the proportion of the population imprisoned, drug overdose mortality and low social mobility. that ill health and a wide range of other social problems associated with social status within societies are also more common in more unequal societies, may imply that income inequality is central to the creation of the apparently deep-seated social problems associated with poverty, relative deprivation or low social status. we suggest that the degree of material inequality in a society may not only be central to the social forces involved in national patterns of social stratification, but also that many of the problems related to low social status may be amenable to changes in income distribution. if the prevalence of these problems varies so much from society to society according to differences in income distribution, it suggests that the familiar social gradients in health and other outcomes are unlikely to result from social mobility sorting people merely by prior characteristics. instead, the picture suggests that their frequency in a population is affected by the scale of social stratification that differs substantially from one society to another. © 2007 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.","2007","wilkinson r.g.; pickett k.e.","social science and medicine","65","9","1965-1978","10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.041","Scopus"," "," "
"1302"," "," "," ","who do people turn to for policing in sierra leone","in sierra leone, as everywhere in africa, there are a surprising number of policing agencies - non-state and state, offering citizens an array of choice for crime protection and crime investigation. far from being the case that ""'pluralization' of security largely ignores the weakest members"" of weak states (goldsmith 2003:18), the evidence from sierra leone, as other african states, is that it provides almost all that the weakest members know of policing. what is particularly striking in sierra leone is the abundant evidence that youth were actually providing local security in areas where the slp are rarely seen. so often demonised as bearing a large part of the blame for sierra leone's woes, and feared as 'the idle unemployed', they, in practice, are committed to playing a role in security and development. surely one way of reducing the likelihood of a return to rebellion is to utilise their energies for the good of the community and to tell them of their worth. the fragmentation of policing calls for a policing policy quite distinct from the european pattern, where diversification is much less pronounced and resources for state policing are more considerable. to view plural policing as a potential solution to law and order issues does not mean a blanket acceptance of all providers. it is for elected government to construct a law and order policy that is based on incorporating all acceptable policing groups. then the government has to define clearly the desired relationship between the various policing structures and set the parameters. the principle of a national strategy of law and order that integrates, regulates, mobilises, and empowers all those willing to preserve law and order in an acceptable manner is a fruitful place to start in improving the quality of security in sierra leone's communities. it could follow the concept adopted in south africa regarding law and order issues as an entry-point to development projects: address law and order holistically as a development issue and not only as a policing issue. south africa's community safety forums bring together every local community organisation, international ngo and government agency concerned with improving the quality of life, to develop a community safety plan (schärf 2000). this, rather than marginalising non-state policing, seems a better approach for sierra leone to follow. © 2005 journal of contemporary african studies.","2005","baker b.","journal of contemporary african studies","23","3","371-390","10.1080/02589000500273953","Scopus"," "," "

"1310"," "," "," ","neoliberal violence social suffering in guatemala s postwar era","things are better now,"" it is commonly said in guatemala,""not like before."" the present is compared to la violencia. in this era after the wide-ranging peace accords, the 36-year internal armed confl ict has become a touchstone for measuring and evaluating an ordinary sense of things. dangers and uncertainties of a previous era, vividly remembered by many, are no longer an overwhelming presence in social experience. that particularly overriding and totalizing kind of violence is now, thankfully, said to be part of the past. things have changed. the number of disappearances and deaths has decreased, massacres and wholesale destruction of villages has waned, the average income of mayan peoples has risen, and average education levels have increased. but there is also deepening socioeconomic inequality brought on by uneven patterns of economic development. and lasting peace has proven elusive. violence has become commonplace. on average, 250 people are murdered each month in the capital city alone (ocavi 2007). tabloid newspapers are canvassed with images of bullet-ridden cars and bloody corpses, tucked a few pages inside more respectable dailies. violent crimes are rarely successfully prosecuted. clandestine terror squads attack individuals in ways meant to look like common crime. the gang violence that now overwhelms the capital is creeping into more rural regions. while the army presumably hunts drug traffi ckers and cracks down on heinous crimes, political violence continues apace, as seen in the 1997 assassination of bishop juan gerardi conedera and campaign-related killings in recent elections (thomas and benson 2008). there has also been a resurgence of right-wing political activity and a former dictator's return to power. because all of this is not categorized as""war,""there is the sense that the""something better""promised for so long has been realized in the postwar period (fischer and benson 2006). in this chapter, we document how emerging forms of violence infl uence a sense of place and social engagements that defi ne everyday life in rural and urban guatemala. drawing on the medical anthropological concept of""social suffering,""we analyze a clustering of lived effects and delineate structural conditions that underpin disparate forms of violence (bourdieu et al. 2000; farmer 2004; kleinman et al. 1997). this literature emphasizes the institutional and structural dimensions of suffering, including the role of markets and governments. scholars have contextualized the origins of suffering and violence amidst sociopolitical and economic conditions and analyzed experiences of violence in the context of everyday attitudes. they have emphasized that in modern societies and capitalist economies suffering tends to adversely im-pact poor and marginalized groups because of the uneven distribution of material, social, and symbolic capital (farmer 2003). likewise, we emphasize the fundamental role of the aggressive program of liberal economic reform that arose alongside the peace accords (as outlined in this volume's introduction and other chapters) in fostering new forms of violence and vulnerability. while violence is most commonly explained in terms of individual actions (not just in guatemala, but in other contexts dominated by a neoliberal zeitgeist, where gang members and other unsavory types are blamed for violence), we instead locate agency in structural conditions themselves, the very processes said to be guatemala's path toward progress and lasting peace. the decentralization of markets and politics has involved an attendant""neoliberalization of violence,""the simultaneous dispersion of violence into everyday forms and the distribution of blame onto individuals, which defl ects attention away from systematically exerted aspects of violence. violence ""not only traumatizes individuals,""angelina snodgrass godoy writes about guatemala's armed confl ict,""but in some cases may transform the social fabric of entire communities, thus explaining the persistence of its effects even in settings where all those who survived the initial violence have departed or died, or where new non-state forces predominate in decision making processes""(2002: 641). like godoy's concept of the""democratization of terror,""which emphasizes how new forms of violence and terror involve expanding segments of the population as either victims or perpetrators (or both), our view addresses the paradoxical way the outsourcing of violence away from a state monopoly contours civil society and political participation in such a way that actually fuels state power. by implicating neoliberal ideologies and policies in the production of the new violence, we complicate simple assessments of the peace accords' successes and failures and challenge the guiding premise that unfettered market forces are necessary for achieving peace and security. the ethnographic setting for our study is tecpán, a town of about 10 thousand located 80 kilometers west of guatemala city. tecpán has a reputation in the region as a progressive and affl uent place. in the city proper, about 70 percent of the residents are kaqchikel mayas, although the spanish-speaking, non-indian, ladino minority has historically exerted disproportionate control over local government and commercial institutions, buttressed by racist ideologies and colonial inequalities. but tecpán is also home to an exceptionally strong indigenous bourgeois class that has long supported ethnic consciousness, the value of education, and economic experimentation. in the past few decades, this group became increasingly assertive in local and national politics (fischer and hendrickson 2002; fischer 2001; hendrickson 1995). since the late 1990s, tecpán has undergone major social transformations. there has been an infl ux of foreign popular culture fare along with various kinds of economic restructuring, including a shift away from traditional milpa agriculture and toward nontraditional export crops in the outlying rural hamlets and entrepreneurial activities in the town's regionally known apparel industry. in both industries, economic production is a powerful means of social and class mobility for mayas. entrepreneurial activity in tecpán has partially been fostered by (or at least emerged within the context of ) the aggressive program of privatization and liberal economic reform and a new attitude toward mayan peoples in the postwar period. yet, opportunities for social mobility and economic advancement have gone hand in hand with the partial erosion of economic control and security for many people (c. smith 1990c). international and national trade reforms entail signifi cant pressures related to market access and competition ( fischer and benson 2006; fischer 2004; goldín and asturias de barrios 2001; goldín 1996; thomas 2006). this context of shifting economic practices and mixed outcomes is one important part of the larger picture of insecurities and inequalities that shape contemporary forms of violence and how people think about and react to them. © 2009 by the university of alabama press. all rights reserved.","2009","benson p.;

"1311"," "," "," ","segregation and the test score gap","disparities in educational outcomes between african americans and whites declined steadily for most of the twentieth century, but this progress has halted or even reversed in recent years (neal 2006). understanding why the black-white test score gap narrowed over time, and why this progress stalled during the 1990s, is critical if we are to design policies capable of further reducing inequality in schooling outcomes in the united states. given the widely documented association between educational outcomes and earnings, health and crime, successful efforts to further reduce the gap would undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for society as a whole. this chapter considers the role of school and neighborhood segregation in explaining trends in the black-white schooling gap. as we will discuss, provocative time-series and cross-sectional evidence points to strong associations between segregation and achievement gaps. the break in trend toward narrower test score gaps coincided with another toward greater school integration. cross-sectionally, states with more segregated schools also tend to have wider gaps. it is not clear, however, whether causal interpretations should be attached to these correlations. social science has struggled mightily to produce definitive proof that segregation and racial disparities are causally linked, and the available evidence-backed by eminently plausible theoretical arguments and proposed mechanisms-has influenced policy debates for decades. key to the supreme court's transformational decision fifty years ago in brown v. board of education is the assumption that racial segregation within the public schools contributes to black-white inequality in schooling outcomes. attending a disproportionately minority school might affect both the motivation of students and their perceptions of the larger opportunity structure they face in society and their exposure to high-quality school resources or even the academic climate in the school. it is possible that the race-ethnicity of one's schoolmates might simply be a stand-in for their academic achievement level, which could affect the way or rate at which teachers present material or the productivity of student study groups, or as a stand-in for their socioeconomic status (ses). in fact, the influential report by james coleman in the mid-1960s argued that a school's ses composition was at least as important in explaining inequality in student achievement as is school racial composition (coleman et al. 1966). understanding the distinct influences of school racial versus social class composition is relevant because some policies focused on reducing school racial segregation may not have very large impacts on school socioeconomic composition, and vice versa. measures of school segregation by either race or social class could matter in largest part because they are proxies for the racial or class composition of the local neighborhood. because most children attend local public schools, in national data there will be a great deal of cross-sectional correlation between school and neighborhood measures of race or ses segregation. the neighborhood social environment could matter above and beyond the composition of the local public school by shaping the youth social norms that help shape children's behavior, particularly given that so much socializing and exposure to local role models occur outside of school (wilson 1987). understanding the distinct influences of school versus neighborhood environments is important for policy because policies such as public or private school choice have the potential to change school but not neighborhood social compositions, and some housing mobility interventions might generate larger changes in neighborhood than school characteristics (see, for example, sanbonmatsu et al. 2006). figure 5.1 presents a basic conceptual framework outlining the potential causal mechanisms linking segregation to test score gaps. neighborhood segregation could affect these outcomes directly or through its influence on school segregation. direct links between neighborhood and test scores might be through neighborhood-level deviant peer influence, role model effects, or impacts on parental income derived from spatial mismatch-type effects. direct links between school segregation and test scores could be mediated by differences in school input quality, or by peer influence operating at the school or classroom level. thinking carefully about the particular mechanism through which social environment affects children is also important in understanding patterns in black-white student outcomes because different measures of segregation have been following different trajectories in recent years. neighborhood racial and economic segregation actually declined during the 1990s, though these national trends mask important differences by region and so do not necessarily imply that neighborhood segregation is not relevant for understanding the slowdown in narrowing of the blackwhite test score gap (glaeser and vigdor 2003; jargowsky 2003). controversy continues about whether school segregation has increased or decreased over this same period. increases reported in some studies (for example, clotfelter 2004; orfield and eaton 1996) confound the increasing diversity of the student body in american public schools with increases in the separation of blacks from students of other races (logan 2004). measures more commonly accepted in the sociological and economic literature on segregation indicate very slight decreases in the degree of segregation over the past two decades. regardless of measure, it is clear that school segregation has declined more slowly than neighborhood segregation over the same time period. the failure of school segregation to track neighborhood segregation reflects a broad decline in governmental efforts to integrate public schools (orfield and eaton 1996; clotfelter, ladd, and vigdor 2005). in our judgment, the evidence linking school segregation to student achievement is stronger than evidence supporting a direct causal role for neighborhood segregation. the current evidence implicating school race segregation certainly outweighs the available research on the effects of school segregation by social class, though the specific mechanisms through which racial composition affects student outcomes remain poorly understood. the best available evidence suggests that a 10 percent increase in the black share of a school's student body would reduce achievement test scores for black students by between 0.025 and around 0.08 standard deviations, and reduce test scores for whites by perhaps one-quarter to two-fifths as much. thus, if school segregation had displayed a decrease in the 1990s commensurate with the observed decrease in neighborhood segregation, our best estimate is that the black-white test score gap would be roughly 0.01 to 0.02 standard deviation narrower. copyright © 2008 by russell sage foundation.","2008","vigdor j.l.; ludwig j.","steady gains

"1321"," "," "," ","creativity techniques in game design","innovation and novelty are seen as important elements in game design but systematic tools and methods for producing creative ideas may be little known or poorly available, and creativity itself can be seen as something mystical [2] that cannot be methodologically enhanced. however, modern creativity research claims that creativity is in the scope of learning and techniques for generating ideas are argued to give competitive advantage [1,2,6]. this may be an important message to designers, but also to the creative leaders. even the most creative mind can commit the crime of repetition. this is because it is natural for the mind to create patterns [1]. usually these patterns are helpful, but seeking new and innovative solutions as in product design, one should be able ""to think outside"" the common practices. designers are required to be creative on demand, yet the procedures and methods for breaking the common approaches are often based on intuitive belief systems rather than on empirically validated theory [9]. one of the solutions to enhance creativity in game design is to use idea generation techniques that help designers to be creative on demand. studies from other industries suggest that there is a strong relationship between the number of idea generation techniques and the number of successful products [8,10]. however, brainstorming, the best known technique, does not necessarily lead to innovation [5], which is also acknowledged in game design [3]. even though brainstorming is useful in some cases, no single creativity technique can provide the ultimate solution for innovation in general: different techniques are needed [10]. idea generation may seem a relatively easy task. however, while anybody can come up with some ideas, applicable and novel ideas do not come easily [9]. this is well established in those studies showing that one of the characteristics of companies successful in development is their ability to generate ideas [3]. in a successful ideating session, the generation of ideas is separated from idea evaluation and early criticism may be seen as harmful to the overall process[6]. whereas vertical thinking targets the one and only solution, lateral thinking targets quantity [1] as a tool for quality [6]. additionally, since idea generation is not a random process governed solely by an individual's personal traits, but a relatively structured process that can be explained [8], a methodological approach is indeed possible. since we believe that game ideas have their special characteristics, and that and general idea generation techniques may not be so very supportive of the nature of game design processes, we designed several experimental game-specific techniques in the gamespace project (http://gamelab.uta.fi/gamespace). these techniques are based on game-related stimuli and structural modules for ideating casual, multiplayer and mobile games. during the project, computer programs and other tools were created to help documenting, game analysis, randomization of stimuli and communicative aspects. these techniques are easy to approach from their functional aspects: the activity of idea generation is based on playing specific board games, card games, using small computer applications or other tools and toys. in light of our workshop experiences with finnish game professionals in 2006 and 2007, these idea generation techniques can be successfully utilized and help designers to create applicable and novel game ideas that they would not otherwise come up with. hence these techniques can be seen as a successful way to help ""creativity on demand"" in game design practices. some of these techniques have already been fruitfully adopted by the finnish mobile game industry. while we have already documented several positive user experiences and know that our techniques work, we are conducting a more extensive user study in autumn 2007 and spring 2008 to gain a systematic understanding of game specific idea generation techniques and game idea generation processes. copyright 2007 acm.","2007","kultima a.; paavilainen j.","proceedings of the 2007 conference on future play, future play '07",NA,NA,"243-244","10.1145/1328202.1328251","Scopus"," "," "

"1382"," "," "," ","social change and criminality","[editor's note] this article is highly theoretical, involving the development of social and legal concepts, yet it is highly recommended for all who are engaged in criminal justice, since it discusses how social change, particularly the rate of change, affects human behavior. social change here is defined in terms of changes in basic societal institutions, such as family, religion and education. individuals maturing in society internalize institutional patterns and learn to live by them. the key factor in the interaction of groups according to institutional patterns is the establishment ofbasic norms of conduct. criminal behavior is defined as deviation from these norms. possibly the most urgent question facing all societies today is how to maintain a reasonable equilibrium in the face of accelerated social change so that the benefits of this change are not offset by a concomitant increase in crime. when societal institutions change, the character of the control that institutions exert on norms of conduct also change. one important observation the author makes in this respect is that all societies seem to move from tight institutional integration to social disintegration where institutions no longer interlock or re-enforce each other. this is particularly evident in regard to the influence of the family, religion and education upon young people, and has led to what is popularly termed a more “permissive” society where there is a great deal less restriction on an individual's social, physical and intellectual mobility. as the author indicates, social changes of this sort are a “mixed bag”. on the one hand it has resulted in an enormous increase in economic wealth, material well-being and educational enbghtenment, while on the other it has left individuals without adequate ethical frames of reference, producing an increase in criminal behavior. central to this overall problem is the relationship ofthe law, since it is ditlicult to define human behavior with the specificity demanded by the law. two features of the law are relevant to any consideration of criminality in the context of social change: its durability and its tendency to expand. laws usually remain long after customs pertaining to them have fallen into disuse, and social change introduces new concepts ofwhat is permissible and what is not, but the law is often slow to adopt these new concepts. in addition, as modem society becomes more complex, the mere quantity of laws tends to multiply to a bewildering degree to the extent where the honest citizen can unknowingly commit any number of offenses unknown to preceding generations. one example is the effect industrialization has had to produce a welter of new areas of crime, such as traffic offenses, organized crime and white collar crime together with a blurring of the distinction of what constitutes criminal acts and shrewd business practices. closely connected with this is the highly technical problem of judicial flexibility versus judicial restraint. the author feels nevertheless that if social change in handled wisely crime might even diminish. a number of suggestions are presented to deal with these perplexing questions. perhaps a greater distinction would be made between criminal and non-criminal acts. in addition, there could be a greater individualization of justice when a violation of a criminal law was unintentional. there are also a number of important questions in regard to the law. is the law the best teacher, or is it too formalized and ought a greater reliance be placed on education? if the law doesn’t grow or change, is the solution simply to expand the enforcing area? if goals are to be set for the most unstable societal element, namely the youth culture, what is the nature of these goals? finally, it is obvious that the minimizing of crime requires careful planning, but planning to achieve positive social and economic results.

"1383"," "," "," ","tigua migrant communities and the possibilities for autonomy among urban indígenas","achieving political-territorial autonomy has become a foundational principle of indigenous movements in ecuador, colombia, mexico, and elsewhere in latin america. fighting for the right to shape their economies, cultures, and politics according to their values within their own communities and towns, indigenous people claim space, both real and imagined, in a highly specific way. economically, territorial autonomy suggests the enduring power of subsistence production, by which agriculture divides indígenas from industrialized mestizos (nash 2001). ethnically, it posits white-mestizo urban places faced off against a vulnerable native hinterland. politically, it locates legitimacy in a decentralized landscape of bounded peasant sectors (for the sierra), rather than sprawling urban shantytowns. drawing on centuries of racial discourse, class subordination, and cultural resistance, the struggle for territorial autonomy tactically energizes the native movement. it even taps currents of neoliberal thinking about devolution of power from the state to private citizens to achieve backing from both the state and the world bank. cities and urban careers of native peoples, however, challenge the premises of territorial autonomy. for decades, rural communities, especially those of quichua-speaking andean people on whom i focus here, have been emptying themselves into cities, large and small. while publications about indigenous people and their politics play up natural cosmologies, peasant organizations, and agriculture, native people themselves often live a composite of rural and urban lives. they work in cities, rent apartments, baptize children in urban congregations, shop in markets, and organize city-based economic and political associations. a political vision of autonomy anchored in bounded rural enclaves ignores this breadth of urban knowledge and experience. if urban life has always fit poorly in countrified theories of native people, globalization raises still more concerns about the city as an empowering lo- cale for indigenous society-or indeed for any ethnic or national identity that rests on the connections between people and places. cities have been on the front lines of financial capitalist integration, pop culture trends, brand name consumerism, intercontinental migrant flows, and the creolization of everything from cuisine to music. as james holston (1996:189) recently argued, the transnational flow of ideas, goods, images, and peoples ""drives a deeper wedge between national space and urban centers."" for native peoples who have tenuous claims on urbanity and citizenship, the accelerated, crimeridden, globally connected millennial city can be especially problematic. in this chapter, i challenge conventional understandings about autonomy and show how city lives can foster a connectivity that reinforces a quichua community's push for self-determination. the space, mobility, and rhythm of urban autonomy break from the bounded vision of political-territorial autonomy discussed by most writers. living in cities, indigenous people interact repeatedly within their communities and outside of them in fluid ways less tied to categorical divisions of place and people. community stability and effectiveness, whether manifest in development projects or collective responses to crises, grows not through sovereignty over a place, but through interactions. elsewhere, i write of this as ""relational autonomy""-a potent, situational capacity to engage powerful others according to one's values (colloredo-mansfeld 2002). here, i want to examine more thoroughly the place-making activities that pattern social and ethnic relations. particularly, i document where indigenous people tap the city's power for encounter and connection. when able, indigenous migrants develop such capacity by distributing their lives across places-by means of artisan production and sales, social spending, schooling, and formal and informal projects of mutual assistance-rather than by anchoring them within a primary location. in contrast to political-territorial assumptions about the importance of production, locales of exchange often orient creative effort and social contacts. at other times, though, migrants convene in the city's liminal spaces, such as sidewalks next to government offices, street corner miniparks, or parking areas of a tenement building. here, in the urban interstices, the settings of action deliver few symbolic resources, thereby placing the burden of communication and coherence directly on the assembled people, for better or worse. in exploring how cities have empowered (and constrained) indigenous people, i focus on tiguan migrants, members of a quichua community with ties to cotopaxi province but who now live primarily in quito. hailing from about a half dozen peasant sectors of guangaje parish, colloquially known as tigua for its river, the migrants number in the hundreds and live dispersed throughout quito's southern neighborhoods and subur ban fringe: ecuatoriana, guamaní, gaupichu, and santo domingo de cutalagua. i look, in particular, at three dynamics. first, i trace urban institutions that tiguans have developed to boost the economic and social clout of their art. while stereotyped as rural commerce that finds outlets in cities, native art as developed by tiguans has often flowed in reverse. throughout the 1980s, tiguan artists shaped markets and development projects to channel urban artistic innovation and economic resources back into the countryside. second, i briefly look at the preoccupations of adolescent boys, sons of the pioneering generation of migrants, and their restless mobility. moving from the fixed points of family life, they develop their interests not by laying the foundations to settle down but by pushing the boundaries of their reach-their knowledge of markets, schools, and neighborhoods and their economic, social, and cultural capital to exploit the opportunities found there. third, i consider the engagement of tiguans with urban legal authorities. coordinating with one another to cope with a capricious (or corrupt) legal system, migrants remind themselves of both their distance from the institutions of state power and of their mutual obligations to one another. following these processes, one direction leads to neoliberal structural reforms and the pressures of globalization. ecuador's fitful efforts to solve its generation-long economic crisis with promarket policies have spurred a massive growth in the informal economy. tiguans, for the most part, toil in this sector, cut off from subsistence safeguards, let alone possibilities for advancement. in neoliberal ecuador, ""informal"" does not mean ""alternative. "" exclusion from the circuits of capital does not mean escape from daily competition, nor from the power of newly wealthy quichua economic entrepreneurs, nor from the pressures of measuring up to an international level of consumerism. following the ethnographic lines in another direction, though, brings out the distinctive achievements of tiguans. their art counts here. by inventing a rich visual vocabulary, they have broadcast the energy of their fiestas, farming, curing rituals, and rural livelihoods to wide audiences. by so doing, tiguans have also generated an economic vitality that restored, at least for a brief time, the partial autonomy and dignity once taken from them by backbreaking commercial farm work. a related dynamism thrives within their community associations. these indigenous organizations grow in quito's cluttered swathes of market stalls, smoggy bus interchanges, vendorcolonized parks, and decaying modernist state offices. as both urban and quichua collectivities, they are attuned to passing opportunities for community- oriented projects, even during an era of crisis. copyright © 2003 by the university of iowa press. all rights reserved.","2003","colloredo-mansfeld r.","millennial ecuador: critical essays on cultural transformations and social dynamics",NA,NA,"275-295",NA,"Scopus"," "," "

"1394"," "," "," ","politics public policy and inequality a look back at the twentieth century","for at least a century, the united states has enjoyed unbridled prosperity. true, there have been significant interruptions in the upward course of per capita growth, most notably during the great depression. although we could not always answer positively to ronald reagan's famous 1980 presidential debate question, ""are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" most of us are unambiguously better off than our grandparents were fifty years ago, or their grandparents fifty years earlier.1 the distribution of prosperity, however, unlike the aggregate, has not followed a monotonic path. the broad outline of what happened is easy to summarize. inequality in income and wealth decreased for much of the twentieth century. the decrease in inequality appeared to fit the hypothesis of simon kuznets (1955): as industrialization led a larger fraction of the population to enter high-productivity activities, inequality fell. the fall in inequality, however, has been arrested and reversed. when inequality started to rise depends on which measure one uses, but the reversal did not start before the late 1960s and was clearly in full bloom before-not after-reagan took office. in this essay, i document that the long-run trend in inequality-decreasing for roughly the first three-quarters of the twentieth century and increasing thereafter-is matched by similar trends in public policy and political polarization, and i discuss the implications of these parallel trends. i focus on public policies, such as taxes and minimum wages, that are tied to inequality, since they are explicitly redistributive. for example, david lee (1999, 979) finds that ""almost all of the growth in the wage gap between the tenth and fiftieth percentile is attributable to the erosion of the real value of the federal minimum during the [1980s]."" estate taxes became more onerous for the first three-quarters of the century before reversing in the late 1970s. top marginal income taxes increased before starting a decline in the 1960s. the federal minimum wage took root in 1938 and increased, in real terms, until the late 1960s but then declined precipitously. i later document in more detail how minimum wages and taxes closely tracked the secular pattern of inequality. as inequality among americans fell during the first two-thirds or three-quarters of the twentieth century, americans also seemed to have grown closer together politically. in 1960 the sociologist daniel bell published the end of ideology: on the exhaustion of political ideas in the fifties. a year later the political scientist robert dahl (1961) pointed to a nation moving from oligarchy to pluralism. similarly, the new ""rational choice"" school in political science emphasized tweedle-dee-tweedle-dum parties focused on the median voter (downs 1957) and members of congress largely concerned with constituency service (fiorina 1978) and universalism in pork barrel politics (weingast, shepsle, and johnsen 1981). what these authors pointed to was echoed in analyses of roll-call voting patterns in the house and senate. put simply, the fraction of moderates grew and the fraction of extreme liberals and extreme conservatives fell from 1900 to about 1975 (poole and rosenthal 1997; mccarty, poole, and rosenthal 1997). just as inequality went from falling to rising in the last quarter of the century, we witnessed a turnaround in politics. keith poole and i have termed this ""the polarization of american politics"" (poole and rosenthal 1984; see also krugman 2002a, 2002b). moderates are nearly extinct. extreme liberals and extreme conservatives have surfaced, particularly extreme conservatives in the republican party. what, more precisely, are the changes in partisan positions that underlie polarization? the republican party in congress moves from a very conservative position in 1900 to a substantially more moderate position in the 1970s before rebounding to 1900 conservatism in 2000. the democratic party becomes more moderate until the 1950s and then drifts, relatively slowly, to a more liberal position. the net effect of these changes is that the differences between the parties-polarization- narrow until the 1970s and then expand. my main focus-stimulated by the parallel trends in economic inequality, political polarization, and public policy-is on how politics and economic inequality relate and are coupled by economic policy. there is, in this respect, an abundance of alternative hypotheses about the rise of inequality. the list includes greater trade liberalization, increased levels of immigration, declining rates of trade unionization, the fall in the real minimum wage, a decline in progressive taxation, technological change increasing the returns to education, the increased rates of family dissolution and female-headed households, the aging of the population, pure racism, america's federal political system, gridlocked national politics, and the absence of proportional representation in elections (for an overview of some of these topics, see atkinson 1997; see also alesina, glaeser, and sacredote 2001). most of these factors are either directly political or potentially affected by public policy. technological change, however, would appear to respond to many forces that are independent of government policy. similarly, the decline of marriage is universal throughout the western world. the roots of this may be just as much in technological changes that affect work in the household and in changes in lifestyle as in the changes in incentives produced through welfare and other public policies. nonetheless, politics and public policy remain the focus of this essay. an important aspect of the increase in inequality is that it has indeed taken place during a period of substantial economic growth. although the quadrupling, from 1970 to 2000, of the proportion of the population who are incarcerated (western, kleykamp, and rosenfeld, this volume) suggests that many african american males may not be better off than their grandparents, by and large the increase in inequality is not a matter of pauperization. 2 although there is debate as to whether the lower end of the income distribution is somewhat worse off or has remained relatively stable in economic status, it has pretty clearly not gotten much worse off. moreover, a substantial segment of the lower tail consists of immigrants who are much better off than they were in their nation of origin. at the same time, in the middle and at the top end of the income distribution, voters have become much richer. this is not just because the growth rate of income at each centile has been increasing in the centile. the poor who are eligible to vote increasingly vote less than the rich. in addition, nonvoting legal and illegal immigrants tend to be poor. another factor, but quantitatively less important than immigration, arises from growth in the number of incarcerated americans and ineligible ex-felons (on both criminals and immigrants in voter turnout, see mcdonald and popkin 2001). prosperity, immigration, and criminal justice policy combine to mute the political response to inequality. this chapter proposes an account of the political and institutional forces that are likely to blunt a movement toward redistributive economic policies. rising wealth and incomes have created a sizable constituency with a vested interest in the status quo, while the growing share of noncitizens and disenfranchised ex-offenders reduces the political power of the poor. as i discuss later, these shifts in the electorate take place in the context of institutional features of the american political system that give economic policies a kind of ""stickiness,"" particularly given the polarization discussed earlier. once established, economic policies that affect the distribution of income tend to be slow to change. the essay proceeds as follows. a theoretical overview of the political economy of inequality is provided in the next section. this section also briefly applies the theoretical perspective to an understanding of events in the twentieth century. in the following section, i make some international comparisons and highlight how the great depression, world war ii, and the 1960s represented exceptional events for the united states. i suggest how politics might be relevant to differences in inequality across nations. in the next section, i document the polarization of politics in the united states. the following section links that political polarization to outcomes in income and wealth inequality and immigration. that is followed by a section in which i argue that increases in aggregate income and wealth and in immigration are acting to mute any political response to inequality. finally, i show how changes in public policies on taxes and minimum wages correspond with changes in inequality and political polarization. this section also emphasizes that old-age insurance taxes follow an entirely different pattern from taxation that is explicitly redistributive. copyright © 2004 by russell sage foundation.","2004","rosenthal h.","social inequality",NA,NA,"861-892",NA,"Scopus"," "," "
"1395"," "," "," ","origins and applications of political policing in argentina","contrary to the myth of a consensual heyday of policing, its origins are to be explained as a response more to pressing political and social challenges than to long-standing problems of daily criminality. the threat, real or imagined, confronted by successive governments had a major impact on the style of policing adopted. threats to established states and the fear of communism after the bolshevik revolution led to the expansion of political policing in both democratic and authoritarian regimes. in argentina, political policing came to dominate police and military activities. the need for it was believed to stem from the country's contentious nature, rooted in the foreign origins of its population. social mobilization in argentina was triggered before the new political institutions could attain a high level of legitimacy, aggravating the elite perception of civil strife as threatening the social order. the absence of a directly threatening external enemy and the limited character of wars may have coalesced to draw the army into the civilian realm. it is beyond the scope of this article to delve into other factors that led the armed forces to expand their role, such as the military mentality, authoritarian ideology, and fear of the popular classes. certainly, its physical presence throughout the country and its involvement in the development of the economy and infrastructure gave it broader national scope than the police. in any event, the form of policing and police organization varied as a function of the place of the military in argentina's history of contentious politics. as i have shown, the 1930 coup increased the repressiveness of the regime and spurred military intervention in policing. that is reflected in the recruitment pattern of the chiefs of police and ideological definitions of the enemy. from 1880, when the capital police was created, until september 1955, when peron was ousted, 30 of 47 chiefs of police had been military men, most of them in active service.","2000","kalmanowiecki l.","latin american perspectives","27","2","36-56","10.1177/0094582x0002700203","Scopus"," "," "

"1419"," "," "," ","residential mobility and desistance from crime and substance use during the transition to adulthood","in recent years, criminologists have increasingly focused on understanding stability and change in crime over the life-course. transitions such as marriage, work, and military service are considered to be potential turning points in the life-course that redirect one’s criminal career. relatively neglected in life-course scholarship is a consideration of whether residential mobility is also a turning point that facilitates desistance from crime and substance use. the few studies that have examined this topic suggest that individuals who make long-distance moves are less likely to engage in crime compared to those who stay or those who make short-distance moves within their community (kirk, 2009; 2012; laub and sampson, 2003; osborn, 1980; sharkey and sampson, 2010; shaw, 1966). yet, several important gaps in the literature exist. the purpose of this dissertation is to advance life-course scholarship by addressing two important gaps in the existing body of research on residential mobility and desistance. first, this dissertation is the first study to examine the relationship between residential mobility (defined as a between-county move) and desistance from crime and substance use during the transition to adulthood. this gap is noteworthy given that residential mobility is an age-graded life event that is central to the transition to adulthood. in the u.s., rates of residential mobility are highest in the young adult years compared to any other developmental period, and scholars suggest that such moves constitute key role transitions and have important implications for locational attainment. second, this dissertation is also one of the first studies to examine whether the relationship between residential mobility and desistance from crime depends on the context of the move. although the average effect of moving may be protective, the effect likely depends on a number of factors. two factors may be especially salient to residential moves during the transition to adulthood: (1) whether the move occurs in the presence of other adult social roles and (2) whether the move results in improvements in community context. there are reasons to expect residential mobility to have stronger or weaker effects depending on these features. this dissertation uses public and restricted geocode data from the national longitudinal survey of youth 1997 (nlsy97). these data contain a wealth of information about the transition to young adulthood, including respondents’ residential mobility, crime and substance use, adult social roles, and community context. in addition, restricted geocode data allows me to construct residential mobility patterns of respondents from 1997–2013 and determine the county-level characteristics of every residential location respondents reported living at during the survey. the primary contribution of this dissertation consists of three empirical chapters. the first empirical chapter examines the effect of residential mobility on desistance from crime and substance use during the transition to adulthood. the second empirical chapter examines whether the effect of residential mobility on crime depends on whether the move is accompanied by positive or negative adult social role transitions. the last empirical chapter examines whether moving into, out of, or remaining in counties marked by concentrated disadvantage and racial/ethnic segregation influences desistance from crime. in all three chapters, random effects regression is used to model within-individual change in residential mobility on change in offending, controlling for important time-stable and time-varying confounders. results revealed that respondents experience immediate reductions in offending after moving, but with delinquency and substance use, the reductions were smaller (and possibly shorter lived); whereas, the reductions for arrest were larger and more sustained. results also revealed that the effects of moving were relatively robust across key groups (i.e., gender, race, age, and criminal propensity). finally, results revealed that the effects of residential mobility often depend on whether they are accompanied by adult social roles as well as the community context.","2018","widdowson, alex oswald","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "

"1423"," "," "," ","spatial and temporal dynamics of neighborhoods and crime","the importance of neighborhoods and places in understanding crime has been widely noted in criminology. using various units of analysis (e.g., states, counties, cities, neighborhoods, places), studies have found that crime tends to be spatially concentrated. based on social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, relationships between the level of crime and various neighborhood characteristics have been noted in the literature. reviews of the existing literature, however, have identified several limitations of neighborhood level studies of crime. first, many neighborhood level studies have utilized cross-sectional samples and failed to analyze temporal dynamics between neighborhood changes and crime. second, until recently, criminological studies paid little attention to two spatial processes, spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity, in developing spatial regression models. third, most studies examined only places and neighborhoods where crimes were committed and failed to account for where offenders were coming from. by integrating newly developed statistical methods from interdisciplinary fields with social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, this dissertation pursued a series of research questions that examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of crime at the neighborhood level. first, a longitudinal analysis of crime between 1960 and 2005 in seattle, wa, indicated that neighborhood crime rate trajectories were characterized by quadratic functions, although there was considerable variability in both the initial level of crime and rate of change over time. the results indicated that neighborhood characteristics based on social disorganization theory and routine activities theory were important in explaining the variability in crime rate trajectories. in particular, social disorganization predicted changes in crime rates decades later, while the level of crime also changed depending on time specific opportunities for crime. for example, racial heterogeneity and residential mobility predicted the initial level of crime in 1960, while the linear rate of change was predicted by socio-economic disadvantage. furthermore, an increase in the percentage of employed women was related with high levels of burglary and auto theft, while an increase in the percentage of public transportation users increased robbery at each time point.second, an analysis of spatial effects indicated the importance of considering both spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity when examining the association between neighborhood characteristics and crime. in particular, although global regression models produce a single measure of association between an independent variable and a dependent variable that applies to a whole study area, the results indicated there was considerable variability in the local patterns of association between neighborhood characteristics and the level of crime. for example, the results indicated that the effects of racial heterogeneity on the level of crime varied in strength and direction across space. that is, although social disorganization theory predicts that racial heterogeneity hinders the realization of common goals among residents and increases crime, the results indicated racial heterogeneity may actually reduce crime in some neighborhoods. variability in local patterns of association are important in further understanding social processes linking the structural characteristics of neighborhoods to the level of crime and developing place-focused crime prevention strategies.third, an analysis of burglars’ target selection indicated that neighborhood characteristics were highly predictive of which neighborhoods burglars target. in particular, it was found that the likelihood of burglars selecting a neighborhood for the commission of their crimes increased as criminal opportunities for crime increased (e.g., weakened household guardianship due to high employment). furthermore, the analysis also indicated that burglars’ target selection varied by burglars’ characteristics, such as age, race, and the presence of co-offenders. for example, burglars’ target selection was strongly affected by their race and the racial composition of the target neighborhood. furthermore, younger offenders’ target selection was strongly influenced by distance from their residence to a target neighborhood, while, in addition to distance, various neighborhood characteristics also affected older offenders’ target selection.overall, the three studies conducted in this dissertation found support for both social disorganization theory and routine activities theory in explaining crime at the neighborhood level. by empirically studying the spatial and temporal aspects of crime at the neighborhood level, this dissertation adds to existing research on the role that neighborhood characteristics play in producing crime-conducive environments.","2008","kikuchi, george m.","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "
"1424"," "," "," ","offender s decision making an assessment of convicted burglars in thailand","burglary represents not only a violation of privacy and theft of private property; it also causes considerable fear, and this is true across the world. unfortunately, most burglary research is conducted with data for western countries, and there is especially little comparative research of u.s. and asian countries, which have different social and cultural contexts. this study draws on the rational choice perspective which argues offenders who are likely to engage in rational decision making processes as they estimate the costs and benefits of committing a given crime. two central questions guide this study: what considerations thai offenders have when deciding whether or not to commit crime, and how they choose specific targets. this study addresses these questions using data from interviews with incarcerated residential burglars in thailand. data were collected primarily though semi-structured interviews with 45 thai inmates who had been incarcerated in federal and local correctional institutions around bangkok and vicinity, and had been convicted of residential burglary at some point in their criminal careers.interviewees were asked about their own experiences in committing burglaries, including those in which they wanted to commit a burglary but chose not to do so as originally planned. interviewees were asked to complete a map task to clarify the locations of their targets on a map of bangkok city. a central focus of the study was the offenders' target selection methodology, and in the study interviewees were explicitly queried as to how they went about identified suitable residential targets for burglary. special attention was given to the extent to which offenders utilized rational processes to select potential burglary targets, and what environmental conditions and features they used as discriminative cues in the process.although the findings of this study should be interpreted carefully due to the relatively small sample size of the interviewees, analysis of the study data indicates that both the risks and the rewards of residential burglary influence burglars' target selection. however, when assessing potential residential burglary targets, burglars are significantly more influenced by environmental cues related to risk than by cues related to reward. most burglars considered some burglary prevention measures such as burglary alarms, neighborhood watch, dogs, and sign of repeat victimization.important key findings relate to cultural differences in burglars’ target selection and the decision making during the burglary process. for example, most burglars believed in fate and luck when they decided to commit burglary. gender and age are both important factors causing differences in residential burglars’ decision making about target selection and crime commission. based on the findings of this study, guidelines that could be useful in the development of various residential burglary prevention initiatives and measures, such as increasing more police patrol, developing job training programs inside prison, and establishing neighborhood watch programs, are put forward for consideration.","2016","tititampruk, dittita","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "
"1425"," "," "," ","bus stops and crime do bus stops increase crime opportunities in local neighborhoods","mass transit is often thought to be dangerous, eliciting concerns for personal security when waiting for and traveling on mass transit. one of the first steps in preventing crime in mass transit environments is to obtain accurate figures of crime. there are two mechanisms linking mass transit to crime: extension of offenders’ journey-to-crime and development of crime attractors and generators. the first mechanism has been tested by comparing crime patterns when a new light rail system was expanded into new areas; these studies reported that new transit systems do not change crime patterns. testing the second mechanism, whether mass transit enhances crime opportunities in the neighborhoods by attracting targets and offenders alike, however, faces more challenges; testing the impact of small places on larger areas such as transit stations on crime is fraught with difficulties due to the interactions with their surrounding environments. these difficulties are even more relevant for bus stops located without clear demarcation or controlled access. using frameworks of routine activity, crime pattern, and rational choice theories, the present study set out to investigate the relationships between bus stops and crime using newark, new jersey as the study area. to delineate the impact of bus stops on their surroundings from other possible covariates, the existence of commercial activities in the areas was also examined. the present research study examined five crime types: robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, theft from motor vehicle, and burglary. to better understand the impacts of spatial aspects of the data, several data analyses methods were utilized. first, the study examined the magnitude and structure of spatial dependence in the data. second, spatial process models were performed and compared with the ols regression results to examine the impacts of spatial aspects on the regression results. third, to address non-normality and spatial dependence of the data, the count response model was run by adding spatial lag as one of the predictors. the data analysis results showed that both bus stops and commercial establishments were associated with increased crime in the neighborhoods. among the business types, some of them displayed more robust relationships than others. for instance, the category of food store was almost always significant to increased crime whereas banks were not statistically significant across crime types and regression methods. considering the fact that fear of crime plays a strong role as actual risk of crime in making travel decisions, it is suggested that the physical and social incivilities should be analyzed by performing an environmental survey using case-control design. in addition, future research should incorporate both short-term and long-term temporal analysis.","2009","yu, sung-suk violet","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "
"1426"," "," "," ","educational mobility and crime throughout the life course","a central question in criminology is the degree to which adult transitions are sources of stability or change throughout the life course. transitions in the form of marriage and employment are said to represent turning points for those most prone for a life course of persistent offending, as such experiences 'knife off' a criminal past. few studies, however, have considered college completion as an adult transition capable of redirecting one's criminal trajectory. moreover, research largely assumes that any attainment represents a positive turning point, but whether transitions like educational attainment really are positive depends on how these resources compare to prior generations, such as those of one's parents.the study of social mobility broadens our understanding of socioeconomic attainments by encompassing continuity and change within the life course, as certain achievements may be indicative of stability while others may represent a change – either positive or negative. for instance, obtaining a high school diploma may symbolize a positive turning point for those who grew up in poverty, while similar achievements for those from a higher social class may reflect a loss in social status if it is not followed by further educational attainment. drawing on theories of social mobility, strain, and relative deprivation, i analyze the relationship between educational mobility and crime using data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health (add health). first, i examine the relationship between educational mobility (i.e., one's own achieved education in relation to parents' attainment) and various types of crime (i.e., instrumental crime, violent crime, and illegal drug use). next, i investigate how gender and race/ethnicity moderate the association between educational mobility and crime. finally, i assess the concern of selection into educational mobility pathways via propensity score analyses, with the purpose of accounting for the confounding bias that may explain the alleged educational mobility and crime association. results show that upward and downward intergenerational mobility are associated with decreases and increases in instrumental crime, violent crime, and illegal drug use, respectively. effects are slightly attenuated in size after controlling for occupational and familial transitions in adulthood, as well as financial stressors and social psychological measures. moreover, downward educational mobility is associated with greater increases in crime for females compared to males, and upward mobility results in greater reductions in crime for blacks and native-born hispanics. finally, results show that overall patterns of intergenerational mobility are robust when incorporating a series of propensity score techniques that account for confounding bias. in total, this dissertation contributes to the long speculated socioeconomic status and crime connection by integrating social mobility and education into criminological research as meaningful sources of change in the life course.","2017","dennison, christopher r.","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "

"1461"," "," "," ","unstoppable the gap between public safety and traffic safety in the age of the driverless car","autonomous vehicles (avs) are already driving on some of the nation’s streets and highways. this technology is advancing quickly and will likely diffuse rapidly throughout society. avs are likely to reduce traffic collisions and prevent motorist deaths, but only if those motorists become passengers, not drivers, thus eliminating human error as a traffic safety hazard.with the traffic safety benefits of the av, there will be little need for the traffic enforcement conducted by police and highway patrol agencies across the country today. yet traffic stops are the most common form of face-to-face contact between police officers and citizens, and traffic enforcement has been a form of crime detection, deterrence and disruption in this country since the dawn of the conventional automobile.[1] this research examines the rising use of av technology and its effects on police use of traffic enforcement to disrupt crime and terrorism. in doing so, it asks the following questions:* once all cars drive themselves, what will the increase in traffic safety cost society in terms of public safety?* what can public safety and homeland security policymakers do about it?* research designwhile avs are not yet widely used, they are likely to become a disruptive innovation that will displace transportation industry jobs and eliminate the need for today’s traffic enforcement model. this phenomenon’s potential impact on public safety is not discussed in any known literature on av technology, nor does it seem to be on the radar of police executives or public policymakers. the research addresses a potential gap in public safety that may be an unintended consequence of avs’ traffic safety advantages.to illustrate that gap, traffic stops are examined through the lens of existing literature, including bureau of justice statistics data, sociological and demographic studies, police and legal journals, and relevant case law. the impact of traffic enforcement on crime and public safety is described using existing published articles, as well as traffic stop case studies and subsequent criminal investigations. related effects are expressed using a diffusion-of-innovations model and examples of plausible future scenarios. theories on innovation in organizations, including government, are applied as potential means to bridge the foreseen gap between traffic safety and public safety after av technology diffusion. among these are signals theory and “nowcasting,” tools that innovators use to “predict the present” by reading signs that the convergence of technology and culture will require pivots in organizational strategic planning.[2]findingswhile it is impossible to accurately predict the rate of av diffusion or how quickly such diffusion will affect traffic enforcement strategies, there is consensus that avs will represent a significant part of the automotive market within the next ten to twenty years.[3] but from a nowcasting perspective, existing signals indicate that av diffusion could happen much faster. these signals include: increased urbanization and associated traffic and parking congestion; permissive, even encouraging, regulatory environments such as smart city initiatives; the popularity of vehicles with semiautonomous features; and the proliferation of disruptive innovations in transportation sectors such as uber, lyft and zipcar.[4]while the timetable for change remains uncertain, avs will reduce the need for police to enforce traffic laws, leading to a diminished capacity for police to detect and deter crime in the same ways they do today. criminals may imagine ways to capitalize on reduced enforcement, leading to less detection of previously undiscovered crimes and criminals; decreased interdiction of crimes involving vehicles, such as drug smuggling and human trafficking; and the potential for terrorists to weaponize vehicles that can drive themselves with very little risk of being stopped by the police. further disruptive technologies will require law enforcement and homeland security agencies to innovate in order to ensure public safety with diminished traffic enforcement capacity.analysisin order to avoid being overwhelmed by criminal exploitation of av technology, policymakers—with leadership and guidance from law enforcement agency (lea) executives—must not take a wait-and-see approach. leas must not leave public safety issues raised by av proliferation to regulatory agencies—such as departments of transportation or motor vehicles—but must take the lead in anticipating and responding to them. to develop effective strategies, leas will have to collaborate with av technology companies in the present to anticipate future public safety risks. such collaboration could serve the goals of leas as well as industry. safer products are more marketable products, and companies that work with law enforcement for the benefit of public safety may have an advantage over those that do not. such discussions could help police discover problems they did not know existed and solutions they did not know were needed.beyond new models of collaboration, new methods of policing and new types of police professionals may be required to keep future cities safe. specifically, traffic agencies will have to pivot from traditional traffic enforcement to technology-based solutions to traffic safety and security. to do so, police professionals will have to imagine a different world—one without traffic enforcement as they know it—and envision how they want that world to look. in order to innovate on behalf of public safety, leas need to assert influence over, and adapt to, such a world starting now. they will also need to overcome cultural inertia—a resistance to change that is inherent to government, and to which their agencies are not immune.recommendationsav technology is no longer nascent—it is here. to follow are practices leas can employ today, as well as courses policymakers can set toward a long-term public safety strategy for dealing with the unstoppable cars of tomorrow.*  lead the way1. leas with traffic responsibilities should become the subject matter experts on the impact of av technology on public safety. policymakers should rely on such expertise to mitigate related public safety threats. traffic enforcement agencies should continue to leverage their expertise and reputations on matters involving the av by:* increasing their accident investigators’ and public information officers’ knowledge about av technology.* joining industry groups to engage with av manufacturers on public safety issues.* educating the public about semi- and fully autonomous technology.* continuously evaluating av and associated technologies for potential threats to public safety, as well as innovative solutions to such threats.*  collect data1. leas and other public agencies should begin collecting data about how avs are used and how semi- and fully autonomous technology affects public safety. collection methods should be evaluated and sources appropriately modified as technology changes and av usage increases. data sources should include, but not be limited to:* traffic collision reports with check boxes that indicate levels of autonomy and whether autonomous features affected the outcome of the collision.* crime reports that indicate if and how an av was used in the crime.* business licenses involving av and related infrastructure technologies.* av registration records.*  incorporate public safety into cyber-physical infrastructure1. public safety organizations must be integrated into the cyber-physical infrastructures of the future. as vehicles become increasingly connected to everything, the related data production could lead to safer vehicle operation and could be used to detect and solve crimes. leas should engage with transportation agencies and city planners to maximize public safety and crime control opportunities. avs should meet prescribed requirements in order to operate within certain infrastructures. such requirements might include:* scanners that evaluate vehicle sensor failure, software vulnerabilities, malware or hacks.* software that ensures avs yield or stop to signals sent by police and other emergency vehicles.* electronic signatures that report vehicle registration information, commercial licensing and insurance status.* preservation of data collected by cyber-connected sensors and software, license plate reader cameras, gps signals or other means in order to track vehicles’ historical movements. such data could have implications not just for solving known crimes or stopping crimes in progress, but for predictive policing methods associated with vehicles’ patterns of criminal activity.*  legislate and regulate1.1. the legality for police to use data collected from infrastructure will depend on how well lawmakers understand the relationship of traffic enforcement on crime detection and deterrence. if police and policymakers pay attention to the av’s effect on this relationship early, they could create substitutes for the traffic stop as a crime-fighting tool. now is the time to consider how public safety threats can be addressed through regulation, as companies will be eager to enter a burgeoning and lucrative market. over the long term, avs will change expectations of privacy on the highway, presenting policymakers with an opportunity to create a future that puts public safety first. instead of judges deciding the legality of particular searches after the fact, legislators could consider issues of privacy and security, debate them openly, and pass laws that give clear search and inspection guidelines to police.*  train and hire for the future1. police agencies today must begin training and hiring for an uncertain future. while av diffusion will affect the way many departments do business, it is unclear how long the change will take or how dramatic it will be. in order to position themselves for the future, police agencies will have to increase their traffic enforcement officers’ competencies. they must also become savvier about general law enforcement, especially as it relates to technology, as cyber-physical technology will become one of the crime-detection tools of tomorrow. training considerations should include:* high-tech accident investigation training to help determine fault in vehicles with semi- and fully autonomous capabilities.* advanced training in highway interdiction, including search and seizure training related to vehicle stops.* increased general law enforcement training for agencies with a traffic enforcement focus to prepare for a pivot toward more traditional policing roles.agencies should also consider hiring more law enforcement professionals for non-sworn positions that bring different skills to policing than uniformed officers—something that could become more relevant in a post-traffic enforcement environment. such positions should be highly paid and respected within the agencies to ensure recruitment and retention of quality personnel with an interest in a long-term career. existing positions that might be hired in increased numbers include:* crime analysts.* evidence and forensic technicians.* computer forensics technicians.* information and technology support staff.some new positions to consider creating include:* computer code programmers.* cyber-security technicians.* surveillance technicians.* technology company liaison officers or technicians.* an agency futurist to advise lea executives on emerging technology and its potential impact on the mission of the agency.* stopping the unstoppablehistorically, law enforcement has risen to challenges and adapted to new roles to meet those challenges. traffic enforcement was one such challenge—a role that was never imagined by police in the years before the advent of the automobile. prior to the 9/11 attacks, police did not consider themselves a bulwark against terrorism; yet, today, they are on the front line of the fight against it. in the years to come, the unstoppable av will cause the role of traffic enforcement to change once again, but police will still be expected to fight crime and terrorism. stopping the unstoppable will require innovation in crime detection and resistance to organizational inertia that denies such change is needed.[1] lynn langton

"1466"," "," "," ","analysis of c3 counterinsurgency inspired policing and the flip side of the coin","introductionas a result of its drugs- and gang-related violence, in 2011, the city of springfield, massachusetts was ranked the twelfth most violent city in the united states, according to data gathered from the uniform crime report of the federal bureau of investigation (fbi). [1] the rise in violence followed the inundation of gangs in the city. since 2009, the number of identified organized gangs that have chapters in springfield has risen sharply. in a single year, the number climbed from 28 to 37 gangs, bringing the city’s gang membership to more than 2,800 people. [2] arriving around 2009 in the north end of springfield in particular, was a gang called los boricuas that came from a mountainous region in puerto rico and set up criminal operations including rampant open air drug markets, strong arm robberies, and intimidation. this led to a turf battle between them and the existing local gangs over who would control that territory. it culminated in several shootings and murders. this gang was exerting its control through intimidation and went so far as to have lookouts riding around on motor scooters with an sks rifle strapped on their backs. gang members were walking into stores and taking whatever they wanted while flashing guns to the clerks. none of these crimes were being reported because there was a level of apathy and fear in the community.much like insurgents in a failed state, gangs thrive on community apathy, an environment wrought of fear, despair, or indifference in which the population in these areas passively permits continued criminal activity and undermines policing efforts. to alleviate these conditions, select police departments around the country have begun to adapt counterinsurgency (coin) inspired tactics that are based on several principles, including building and maintaining legitimacy within the community, emphasizing intelligence-driven operations, and focusing on unity of effort among all service providers. [3]the massachusetts state police (msp) special projects team instituted a new policing method in the fall of 2009, called “counter criminal continuum (c3) policing,” to help address gang crime in the north end of springfield, one of the most depressed neighborhoods of the city. c3 policing was advanced by troopers returning from the overseas war on terror with specialized skill sets, adapting coin principles originally developed to battle insurgents by army special forces (green berets) to domestically target gangs. based on these principles, c3 aimed to build rapport with the community and underscore unity of effort among the community, local police, and state police.c3 policing is designed around a campaign plan that utilizes eight building blocks as the foundation of the program. these blocks are: gang demobilization, community outreach meetings, street leader program, youth and parental workshops, anti-gang messaging/information operations, business and community leader development, law enforcement and civil community engagements, and law enforcement operations. [4] the end state of the process, ideally, is a re-shaping of the community environment, which makes it inhospitable for gangs, drugs, and violent criminal behavior.research questionan objective and current analysis of the true effect of the c3 counterinsurgency inspired policing model on the community is needed. which metrics of change in the quality of life within the north end of springfield most accurately assess the efficacy of c3 counterinsurgency inspired policing? more broadly, is there a “flip side of the coin”? that is, are there unintended consequences associated with the c3 policing model?problem statementthe c3 policing model marks a significant departure from the way policing has traditionally been conducted in the north end of springfield. past practices of traditional and community policing models have been unsuccessful, creating the need for the implementation of the c3 model. c3 may, or may not be more expensive to support, but it most certainly does require reprioritizing budget decisions and outlays. it could quite possibly affect the way the department trains and equips the members or possibly even the way officers for certain positions are recruited. meanwhile, it is yet to be seen whether the c3 method of policing has shown convincing, positive, measurable results in terms of the quality of life in this area.however, there is an undercurrent of concern among critics of the military nexus in social science research and application; they warn that applying a counterinsurgency approach in domestic law enforcement, regardless of how it is labeled, risks casting local communities as hostile populations. such overused terms as “the war on crime,” “the war on drugs,” or “the war on terror” exacerbate this blurring of the lines and the civil-military and practical problems that arise in the process. the same is true for the journalistic and professional commonplace practice of police calling many urban areas combat or war zones.events in ferguson, missouri at the time of the writing of this thesis provide an opportunity to engage in a public conversation and reflect upon issues like race relations, civility, and the kind of communities in which we wish to live. in that case, a young man lost his life as the result of a police action, and the response to the ensuing civil disobedience by law enforcement has highlighted law enforcement tactics and the militarization of the police. how the police respond to large-scale disturbances and misinformed perceptions with respect to the 1033 program, which makes military surplus equipment available to local law enforcement agencies, should not be allowed to hijack the conversation. [5] so before we allow the discussion to be derailed by those engaged in lawlessness or by well-intended academics, social activists, or the media, it is time to explore and reveal the perceptions of the public in this community that we are duty-bound to protect—those who are the real stakeholders. [6]with all this in mind, is it possible to promote a positive collaboration and interaction with community leaders and residents with the c3 approach? does this method help or hinder our efforts of providing a safe environment through police-citizen partnerships, with an emphasis on mutual trust, integrity, fairness, and professionalism?hypothesisif the c3 method of policing has been effective in countering gang activity, then there should be a measurable change in crime, and the overall quality of life should show improvement. to test this hypothesis, data was collected from various published city and neighborhood sources to analyze the effects of c3 policing on the community. indicators, such as litter, graffiti, crime statistics, economy, housing, and crime-related medical calls, should afford a broader understanding of the actual effects on the community than crime statistics alone could provide. springfield provides a unique research opportunity in this regard because it has more than five years of statistical data, raw information, and documentation of the implementation of the c3 effort.the metrics analyzed thus far have been completely based on quantitative indicators. this is typically how coin-based strategies are graded. [7] the recognized standard has been using two categories to assess this data. the first is an effects-based assessment that requires researchers to track the results of specific events in the target area over time and build a picture of campaign momentum. the second is pattern and trends analysis that identify various metrics for study and also identifies trends in each over time. that is why the metrics for the two years preceding c3 and four to five years since the implementation were collected. this classic coin approach is similar to the methods used in this study. it must be remembered though, that the debate continues regarding the correct method of analyzing coin efforts, and no single model has yet been deemed appropriate. [8]reviewing the results of this case study revealed some expected and unexpected outcomes. although there were some clear and definitive trends, there were also indiscernible ones as well. most of the economic and some of the health data were unsuccessful in showing positive trends. however, examples of school impacts, such as truancy rates and delinquency, show positive signs. looking at crime through arrests and calls for service reveal a neighborhood that is becoming more involved with law enforcement and that perhaps trust and legitimacy are indeed being established since the implementation of c3. increased community involvement was also apparent in the political realm as the number of registered voters continued to climb; this is sometimes an indicator of “voting for a change.” lastly, positive trends were apparent in both instances of graffiti and litter, which indicates that this community is making it less hospitable for gang activity to develop and flourish.findingsalthough some argue quite convincingly a contradictory view, the violence, drug activity, and criminal behavior that we see in springfield’s north end do not constitute an insurgency. criminal gangs have no ideology beyond their own profit, no political aspirations what so ever, and only achieve passive community support through violence or intimidation. gangs are nothing more than basic criminal entities. some coin principles and practices can, however, support the current law-enforcement strategy aimed to detect, deter, and degrade gangs. the effectiveness of these efforts seem to depend more on deepening reciprocal trust and building legitimacy in the police than perhaps on the application of all of the lessons learned overseas during the global war on terror to springfield’s inner city neighborhoods.without a doubt, coin strategy is a military strategy; however, the basic skills of working with and through the community, intelligence driving operations, and conducting investigations are all fundamental law enforcement practices. through many conflicts, the military has learned and honed these specific skills, eventually applying them with success through their special operations communities (u.s. army special forces green berets). now is the time for new ideas, such as c3 policing that examines these practices and creates that which has always been missing in community policing: a defined strategy to confront criminal street gangs. c3’s coin gang strategy provides the advantage of strong agency and community relationships to identify, target, and remove the gangs through the use of intelligence driven operations. when properly administered and executed, this strategy of intelligence-driven targeting and operations should be the most effective and efficient means to detect, deter, degrade, and dismantle criminal gang activity in the city of springfield.policy recommendationsthe recent appointment of a new police commissioner in the city of springfield has prompted the request for a city wide expansion of the c3 program. prior to such a commitment by the department, the following recommendations are made based upon the information revealed in this thesis:recommendationbased upon the findings contained within this thesis, the selection of prospective officers for any c3 assignment should take into account the multidisciplinary skills required of coin inspired policing, many of which may not be obtained in traditional law enforcement training. the current c3 team was hand selected based upon prior experience both in law enforcement and military deployments, language, and technical skills. the tasks and organization of the team are unique to the mission, tactical situation, and the technical, cultural, and social terrain. therefore, training should be developed and offered to reflect the department’s commitment to this initiative if our expectations are to entertain its expansion. failure to commit the proper personnel with the appropriate skills, training, and motivation could ultimately result in the failure of this proposed expansion.recommendationthe research shows that in regard to expanding c3 into new communities, law enforcement should seek invitation and permission from the community prior to commencing operations. the neighborhood should be the initiator of the contact as opposed to being arbitrarily selected by either law enforcement or the city administration. the community must have a desired interest in the outcome and be willing to be an active participant in the effort. it is imperative to its success that law enforcement is able to identify and work with the true local leaders and to enlist the support of local community groups. building legitimacy is crucial to achieving these goals. ultimately, the ability to mobilize the population against the gang problem depends on good relations between the community and police. ideally, the end state of the process is a re-shaping of the community environment to make it inhospitable for gangs, drugs, and violent criminal behavior.recommendationfor c3 policing to succeed, a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement, public health, public works, school officials, and non-government organizations should be assembled and mobilized in the planning phases before operations commence. this “working group” should conduct a mission analysis and develop an “implementation plan” including, but not limited to, the following:* analyze the community’s concerns* analyze the departments mission, intent, and expectations* determine specified, implied, and essential tasks* determine constraints, prohibitions, and restrictions* construct a timeline with stated goals* develop themes and messages (intra-agency, inter-agency, media, and public)* establish course of action evaluation criteria (metrics)* conduct a cost analysis to explore the feasibility of implementationrecommendationcritics of the military nexus in social science research and application warn that applying a counterinsurgency approach in domestic law enforcement, regardless of how it is labeled, risks casting local communities as hostile populations. over used terms, such as “the war on crime,” “the war on drugs,” “the war on terror” add to this perception, as do articles quoting police calling many urban areas combat or war zones. it is essential we make every effort to promote the positive collaboration and interaction with community leaders and residents to promote our message of providing a safe environment through police-citizen partnership with an emphasis on mutual trust, integrity, fairness, and professionalism.------------[1] federal bureau of investigation, preliminary annual uniform

"1481"," "," "," ","state building on the ground police reform and participatory security in latin america","in this dissertation i investigate the persistence of institutional weakness and examine the conditions under which change becomes possible. such questions are of particular importance in latin america, where a democratic period marked by high rates of crime and violence in many countries has laid bare the precariousness of state institutions.what we've observed throughout latin america and elsewhere, is that conditions facing police institutions, such as extensive corruption, violence, and incompetence in fighting crime, may exhibit a remarkable continuity over time, even when they are widely recognized as a problem. why does institutional weakness persist for such extended periods of time, particularly on an issue that is so politically salient? under what conditions do political leaders undertake institutional reform?drawing on evidence from periods of reform and ""non-reform"" in colombia, buenos aires province, and são paulo state, i demonstrate that the root of institutional continuity and change can be found in societal contestation over the distribution of protection and repression, which inhibits the formation of a coherent demand for reform. such fragmentation facilitates what i call patterns of accommodation among political leaders and police institutions, wherein politicians grant police broad autonomy in exchange for the cooperation of the manager of the state's coercive authority in advancing their political objectives. reform becomes possible following the onset of a mobilized scandal, a high-profile act of police deviance that reveals shared preferences across a range of societal sectors that is then utilized by a robust political opposition that can maintain the event on the agenda as a platform for attacking the incumbent. facing a clear societal demand and an electoral threat, politicians become more likely to enact reform following such a mobilized scandal.  furthermore, given the role often played by societal fragmentation in impeding reform, i investigate the conditions under which politicians choose to build state capacity through the incorporation of societal actors. i argue that reform is likely to include ""participatory security"" in contexts of poor police-society relations or low police capacity and resources, with different values along these dimensions leading to important differences in institutional design.","2014","gonzalez, yanilda maria","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "
"1482"," "," "," ","the importance of layering iot security","push notification services. one of the best examples of these high-performance security processes is the smartphone in your pocket or handbag. push notification services (pns), a highly efficient and secure remote notification feature for android, ios and microsoft smartphone devices establishes an encrypted ip connection with the pns and receives notifications over this connection. if a notification for an app arrives when that app is not running, the device alerts the user that the app has data waiting for it. when new data for an app arrives, the provider prepares and sends a notification to the pns, which pushes the notification to the target device. this process also works with other iot devices, sensors and even ip cameras.the pns establishes peer-to-peer authentication in the iot sensor identity transport layer security (tls). the iot device initiates a tls connection with the pns, which returns a digital certificate from the server. the device validates this certificate and then sends its device certificate to the pns, which validates that certificate. pns servers also have the necessary certificates, credential authority certificates, and cryptographic keys (both private and public) for validating connections and the identities of providers, corporate servers and iot devices. this provides a more secure alternative to ssl, especially considering the latest pci-dss 3.1 compliance requirementsour petroleum example is another case in point. if caught in time, the iot sensor network responsible for detecting leaking pipes would have notified plant operators in real time to implement a repair. should a petroleum refinery flow sensor or server come under attack, the usage archives or historical data could be compromised. a cyber-attack on a refinery during peak winter (heating) or summer (automobile usage) periods could be catastrophic. protecting iot sensor data in motion is important, but intelligence in the wrong hands can be deadly. this is what cyber resilience is all about: not only protecting the operation and transmission of data, but preserving ""data at rest.""iot data may statically reside internally, immediately nearby or in mobile objects and iot data concentration storage points. the data may be distributed widely, but it always must be transmitted and stored securely. the migration or ""flow"" of iot data can continue from one secure container to another, until a centralized data store is reached where more sophisticated processing and analysis takes place, like facial recognition or other pattern matching algorithm.","2015",NA,"securityinfowatch.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "
"1483"," "," "," ","trading privacy for promotion fourth amendment implications of employers using wearable sensors to assess worker performance","this article considers the fourth amendment implications of a study on a passive monitoring system where employees shared data from wearables, phone applications, and position beacons that provided private information such as weekend phone use, sleep patterns in the bedroom, and emotional states. the study's authors hope to use the data collected to create a new system for objectively assessing employee performance that will replace the current system which is plagued by the inherent bias of self-reporting and peerreview and which is labor intensive and inefficient. the researchers were able to successfully link the data collected with the quality of worker performance. this technological advance raises the prospect of law enforcement gaining access to sensitive information from employers for use in criminal investigations. this article analyzes the fourth amendment issues raised by police access to this new technology. although the supreme court currently finds government collection of a comprehensive chronicle of a person's life to constitute a fourth amendment search, widespread employee acceptance of mobile sensing could undermine any claim in having a reasonable expectation of privacy in such information. additionally, employee tolerance of passive monitoring could make employer data available to the government through third party consent. when previously assessing employees' privacy, the court demonstrated a willingness to accept the needs of the employer and society as justification for limiting workers' fourth amendment rights. ultimately, then, court precedent suggests that passive monitoring could erode fourth amendment rights in the long term.","2020","dery, george m, iii","northwestern journal of law and social policy","16","1","17-46",NA,"ProQuest"," "," "

"1486"," "," "," ","returning home residential mobility neighborhood context and recidivism","america’s growing prison population has led to an increasing number of released offenders. the high rates of offenders returning to prison after their release, whether through revocation of parole or new criminal behavior, have renewed interest in explanations of recidivism. while researchers have focused on individual level crime theory and characteristics to explain recidivism, one neglected area of study is neighborhood context’s role in recidivism. this is odd because much recent research has endeavored to establish the link between context and crime. the experiences of recently released offenders offer ample evidence that neighborhood context would logically influence recidivism, or the return to criminality, in much the same way as for other criminality, if not more. the few examples of research that attempts to address this gap also fail to incorporate the fact that recently released offenders are likely a highly mobile population, something that could cause error in contextual analysis. this dissertation attempts to add to the knowledge of contextual effects on recidivism while improving on previously used methods. using a unique dataset of released offenders in ohio that contains serial residence and violation information, this project tests a social disorganization model of recidivism, while also analyzing mobility patterns. a third analysis uses a unique property of the dataset: the fact that it includes prisoners sentenced under indeterminate and determinate sentencing guidelines. this offers the chance to assess the deterrent aspects of the switch in sentencing as well as how deterrence interacts within neighborhood context. the first analysis of residential mobility patterns answers four questions: do recently released offenders move, where do recently released offenders move, who lives where initially, and who moves? the results indicate that offenders do move and move at a higher rate than the general public, with most offenders in the study experiencing at least one move in the first year after release. these movements are mostly lateral, or to neighborhoods that are similar to the neighborhoods offenders reside in immediately after release. neighborhood of initial residence is related most notably to race and whether an offender is released into a halfway house. finally, movement is related to employment, race, and living in a halfway house. the second analysis of contextual effects on recidivism, using discrete time multilevel logistic regression models to predict likelihood of a parole violation and arrest, reveals support for social disorganization theory. the results show neighborhood economic disadvantage and residential stability are related to individual offender’s likelihood of recidivism. individual characteristics, like demographic characteristics, prior offending history, employment and a time variant measure of residential mobility are also related to recidivism. the third analysis uses a quasi-experimental method to test deterrence between parolees and prc offenders. after propensity score matching a sample of both groups, the results reveal little evidence of a deterrent effect of length of potential punishment on recidivism beyond a consistent parolee/prc effect. interestingly, contextual measures only mattered for parolees, indicating that deterrence and context may interact. the results from this set of analyses indicate three major findings. first, while prisoners move, that movement is mostly lateral, meaning that contextual research that has not taken movement into account is likely unbiased. second, neighborhood context does matter for recently released offenders, as offenders in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods and less residentially stable neighborhoods are more likely to recidivate. third, recently released offenders showed little evidence of being deterred, although there was some evidence that parolees in disorganized neighborhoods were more likely to recidivate than parolees in better neighborhoods, indicating a potential undermining of deterrence in disorganized neighborhoods.","2009","huggins, christopher michael","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "
"1487"," "," "," ","saving the world one neighborhood at a time the role of civil gang injunctions at influencing gang behavior","while violence across the united states has declined dramatically over the past two decades, gang-related crimes remain at unacceptably high rates, especially within the city of los angeles, america's gang capital. gang-related crimes generally involve groups of individuals and have a strong territorial component, lending themselves to geographically targeted interventions. a strategy that has charmed law enforcement agencies with its ability to take advantage of both the social and spatial features of a gang is the civil gang injunction (cgi). essentially, a cgi is a tailored restraining order against a gang, prohibiting its members from engaging in specific nuisance behaviors within a demarcated geographical region, termed a ""safety-zone."" evaluations suggest that cgis are effective at reducing serious crime and residents' fears; yet, cgis remain a time-consuming and costly strategy with an unstudied mechanism for why they work. do cgis influence how gang members associate and where they hangout? and, more importantly, how do cgis contribute to changes in gang violence?  using the framework of routine activities theory, this dissertation focuses on the relationship between cgis, gang members' patterns of association and lethal violence. to address these questions i utilize two unique datasets: homicide case files and field identification (fi) cards gathered from the hollenbeck community policing area of the los angeles police department. my first chapter utilizes social network and spatial analyses to investigate the patterns of association among enjoined gang members at the individual- and group-level. i examine both the characteristics of enjoined gangs' social networks, ascertaining their influence in disrupting social ties, as well as examining the geographic characteristics of fis to discern if enjoined gangs have changed the spatial patterns of their associations. my second chapter looks at both the homicide trends over the last decade and the disparities between non-gang and gang homicides, both enjoined and non-enjoined, to consider how cgis influence the characteristics of violence. lastly, in my third chapter i construct a turf-based spatial typology of gang homicide to investigate the impact that cgis have on the mobility patterns of participants involved in gang-related homicides. if cgis influence gangs' spatial patterns of association by discouraging members from congregating in public, then a cgi in theory shifts members' activity and travel patterns, suggesting that gang homicides involving enjoined gang members would experience a different mobility pattern than gang homicides involving only non-enjoined gang members.  results from this dissertation indicate that cgis are able to influence the patterns of association of individual gang members, particularly in the short-run. conversely, at the group-level, enjoined gangs do not always respond as predicted by the rational of a cgi, with a gang's social network either being disrupted, with members' social ties losing connectedness, or a gang's social network converges, with members' social ties increasing in connectedness. it also appears that while cgis are able to dislodge enjoined members from their gang's hangouts, a cgi actually constrains the overall mobility of enjoined gang members, reducing the likelihood that enjoined gang members are venturing outside of their gang's claimed turf. in relation to influencing the overall patterns of gang violence, the findings suggest that cgis could be shifting enjoined gang homicides away from the street and into less public spaces, along with involving fewer suspects and victims. results also indicate that the presence of cgis in hollenbeck has impacted the mobility patterns of participants who are involved in a gang homicide. specifically, an increase in internal gang homicides and a reduction in predatory gang homicides were observed in the data. these findings are consistent with earlier results indicating that the mobility of an enjoined gang member is restricted by the presence of a cgi. overall, the goal of this dissertation is to provide both scholars and criminal justice professionals with a better understanding of cgis, and ascertain if they are an appropriate strategy to disrupt a gang's patterns of association and diminish their opportunities to participate in violent acts.","2014","valasik, matthew aaron","proquest dissertations and theses",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ProQuest"," "," "

"1492"," "," "," ","economic transformation and regional crime","many localities in regional australia are undergoing economic transformation. in many places, agriculture and mining, together with their related service and processing industries, are being displaced as the dominant economic activity by manufacturing, tourism and recreation, and retirement industries. economic change affects local communities. population mobility due to changes in employment disrupts the social structure of localities. this affects the nature and intensity of social interactions among locals, and it influences a community's ability to develop efficient mechanisms of social control. this has a direct impact on local crime rates. this paper, the third in a series devoted to the study of crime in regional australia (see carcach 2000a, 2000b), explores further the effect that interactions between size, location, economic transformation and social attributes have on local crime rates. using data for local government areas in the mainland eastern states, this study shows that: * crime rates are lower in localities that are both residentially and socially stable. * though associated with low local crime rates, factors such as low residential mobility, high average educational level, low income inequality and low unemployment operate differently depending on the population size of local areas and their geographic position relative to major service centres. * crime rates in small and medium-sized towns that are proximate to a major service centre are highly sensitive to changes in economic and social conditions. this suggests the possibility of crime being diffused from major urban centres to minor surrounding towns. this study reinforces the need for localised crime control and prevention initiatives and, more importantly, highlights the need for understanding how the crime patterns of local areas relate to each other.
