These findings are central to understanding the main conclusions of the study.
- The confirmation of these hypotheses supports the crime pattern theory, which is a significant theoretical contribution of the study, as indicated in the second quoted passage.
- The practical implications of these findings are highlighted in the third quoted passage, suggesting that knowledge of past residences can aid in solving crimes.
- The tables provide detailed statistical support for these findings, although their specific contents are not quoted here.","  - ""The first data source is a police information system used by the Greater The Hague Police Force that was designed to support crime investigations.""
  - ""The second source of data is the population registration data, which are held in a nationwide information system (Dutch acronym GBA) used by Dutch municipalities and several other agencies, to keep track of birth, death, nationality, marriage, divorce, childbirth, and residential addresses of all Dutch citizens.""

  - ""The purpose of a discrete choice model is to explain the outcome of a discrete choice situation, which is the situation in which an individual decision maker has to choose a single alternative from a limited number of distinct alternatives""
  - ""the estimation of a conditional logit model requires that we set up a large data matrix that has, for each of the 7,179 offenses analyzed, as many rows as choice alternatives (i.e., each of the 4,000 postal code areas in the data set is a choice alternative for each of the 7,179 offenses).""

- The study employs a discrete choice model to analyze the selection of crime locations by offenders.
- A conditional logit model is used to estimate the likelihood of an area being chosen for a crime based on various factors such as distance from the offender's home and whether the offender has lived in the area before.
- The study uses a large data matrix with each offense analyzed against multiple choice alternatives (postal code areas).
- The dependent variable is a dichotomous variable indicating whether an area was chosen for a crime.
- Independent variables include factors like distance to the offender's home and past residence history.
- The study tests various hypotheses related to residential history and distance using the conditional logit model.","  - ""The first hypothesis to be tested in this study is coined the home hypothesis. It relates the residential history of an offender, including any past residences as well as the present residence, to his or her selection of a crime site.""

- The results show that offenders are more likely to return to areas they have previously targeted, especially if the crimes are frequent, recent, nearby, and of the same type.
- The study uses statistical models to demonstrate these findings, with high explanatory power indicated by pseudo R-squared values.
- The tables provide detailed statistical evidence supporting these conclusions, showing significant odds ratios for various factors influencing crime location choice.","  - ""Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses.""

</table_quotation>""","- The study uses data from four different sources to analyze crime location choices, indicating a comprehensive data collection approach.
- Data were obtained from a police information system, which suggests reliance on official crime records.
- Discrete choice models were employed to analyze the decision-making process of offenders in choosing crime locations.
- The study uses a dichotomous dependent variable to indicate whether an area was chosen for a crime or not.
- A large data matrix was created to estimate conditional logit models, which is a statistical method used to analyze the choice data.
- The use of pseudo R-squared values indicates the model's explanatory power, which is a common metric in statistical modeling.
- The tables referenced provide additional details on the statistical models and data used in the study.","  - ""The dependent variable is dichotomous, with a value of 1 indicating the area that was chosen by the offender to commit the offense, and 0s for all other postal code areas.""
  - ""First, for each offense and the associated 142 alternative postal code areas, a dichotomous variable previously chosen (0 = no; 1 = yes) was constructed to indicate whether the offender had committed a prior offense in that particular postal code area in the previous 3 years (to test hypothesis 1).""
  - ""Second, to test the proximity hypothesis (hypothesis 2), a distance to prior offense variable (continuous) was created by calculating the Euclidian distance in kilometers from the former crime location(s) to each of the 142 alternative target areas.""
  - ""Third, for testing the recency hypothesis (hypothesis 3), six different dichotomous variables (previously chosen within . . . days) were created to indicate whether a postal code area was a previous crime location within 1) a maximum of 2 days, 2) 3-7 days, 3) 8-30 days, 4) 31-183 days (1-6 months), 5) 184-730 days (6 months to 2 years), and 6) 731-1,096 days (2-3 years) before the dependent variable offense.""
  - ""Fourth, for each alternative target area, the total number of prior offenses committed in that particular alternative was calculated (number of prior offenses).""
  - ""Fifth, two dichotomous variables were created to indicate whether the prior offense was of the same or different crime type as the dependent variable offense (same type and different type, to test hypothesis 5).""
  - ""Several variables were constructed following the findings and methods described by Bernasco (2010b) . Residential areas in which the offender lived at the time of the offense were indicated, divided into two separate variables to indicate areas in which the offender had lived for a shorter period (since <2 years) at the time of the offense or for a longer period (since >2 years).""
  - ""In addition, four variables were created to indicate former residential areas, taking into account the duration of living: lived long (>2 years) versus short (<2 years) at a former address; and the recency of moving: lived in the area until recently (<2 years) versus until long ago (>2 years).""
  - ""A last variable concerning the home location was the distance from the area in which an offender lived at the day of the offense to all potential target areas that could have been chosen to commit the offense.""
  - ""Specific target area characteristics were included as control variables in our study because they are described as indicators of crime attractors and crime generators (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1995) or of guardianship (Cohen and Felson, 1979), and several studies have found that they influenced crime rates in an area (Bernasco and Block, 2011;Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;McCord et al., 2007;Nieuwbeerta et al., 2008;Reynald, 2011).""
  - ""For each postal code area in the Netherlands, census-like statistics (sociodemographic and socioeconomic information) are regularly recorded by Statistics Netherlands. For each postal code area in the greater The Hague area, information was obtained on the number of residents (total number and number of residents with a non-Western ethnic background), and households (total number and number of singleperson households) for the years 2006-2009.""
  - ""The LISA database (in Dutch: Landelijk Informatiesysteem Arbeidsplaatsen; for more information, see Steenbeek et al., 2012), which contains information on businesses and other facilities where paid work is done, was used to obtain crime year-specific information about several area characteristics in each postal code area in the greater The Hague area.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=14 table_on_page=1>```

- The data collection spanned from 2009 to 2018, as mentioned in the context of the dataset used.
- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) was the SA2, which is described as roughly equivalent to neighborhoods and typically containing 2000-4000 residents.
- The total area of the study site is not explicitly mentioned in terms of km², but it is implied to be the entire country of New Zealand since the study uses national data.
- The types of crime analyzed included residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery, and extra-familial sex offenses.
- The type of discrete choice model used was the conditional logit model.
- The sampling approach for alternatives involved comparing different strategies, including importance sampling and simple random sampling.
- Independent variables included in the model were related to the proximity of offenders' routine activity nodes to each SA2 and the level of crime opportunity in each SA2.
- The population per spatial unit is mentioned as typically containing 2000-4000 residents.
- The choice of SA2 as the SUoA is justified by its equivalence to neighborhoods and its use in other crime location choice studies.
- Data sources used included police data and census data.
- Limitations mentioned include the potential for selection bias and the fact that not all activity nodes of all offenders were included in the data.","  - ""Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings.""
  - ""Simple random sampling, however, tends to risk overestimating both parameter estimates and model fit.""
  - ""Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice.""
  - ""Our results suggest that overall, importance sampling that ensures the inclusion of choice alternatives near to offenders' activity nodes can lead to coefficients and model fit on par with the results of the full model using all alternatives in each choice set, while reducing the computational burden considerably.""
  - ""The findings of this paper have important implications for future crime location choice studies, and make a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders' spatial decision making.""
  - ""There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders' prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations.""",,"- The study tested methods of sampling to overcome computational challenges in using large datasets for crime location choice research. It found that importance sampling produced more consistent results compared to simple random sampling.
- Importance sampling was effective in capturing the strong relationships between offenders' prior activities and crime locations, which is a key finding in understanding crime location choice.
- The study concludes that importance sampling is a simple and effective method for future studies, allowing for the use of larger datasets and providing insights into crime location choice.
- The results highlight the limitations of simple random sampling, which can lead to overestimation of parameter estimates and model fit.
- The study makes a novel contribution to the literature on offenders' spatial decision making, emphasizing the importance of considering activity nodes in crime location choice.","  - ""Methods Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders' pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members' homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives.""
  - ""The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders' activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime.""

- The primary method used in the study is a mixed logit model, which is a type of discrete choice model. This model is used to estimate the probability of individuals selecting one outcome from a set of options.
- The mixed logit model is chosen because it can handle the nested nature of the data, where multiple observations (robberies) are associated with individual decision-makers (robbers).
- The study conducts a multicollinearity test to select independent and control variables for the model.
- The mixed logit model is used to assess the influence of prior street robbery experiences on subsequent street robbery location choices.
- The model includes variables such as time interval between robberies, distance of journey to prior robbery, and whether the robber was arrested in the act of a prior robbery.
- The study also controls for community attributes to determine the utility of choosing a particular community for subsequent crimes.
- The data includes both single and group robberies, with a method for handling group offenses by treating them as a single decision-making unit.","  - ""The groups of factors are considered: robbers' individual experiences and community characteristics.""

</table_quotation>""","- The paper uses a conditional logit model to analyze burglars' target location choices, which depends on various attributes of both residential and potential target neighborhoods.
- The dependent variable is the burglars' target location choice.
- Independent variables include:
  - Concentrated disadvantage of the target neighborhood (binary indicator).
  - Normalized mobility flow between the origin and target neighborhoods.
  - Level of physical disorder in the target neighborhood.
  - Control variables such as distance between the burglar's home and the target, population size of the target community, presence of post-2000 buildings, high-rise buildings, subway stations, bus stops, parks, and entertainment venues.
- Interaction terms are included for concentrated disadvantage, mobility flows, and physical disorder.
- The tables provide detailed statistical models and results for these variables, confirming their role in the analysis.","  - ""We measure observed and perceived physical disorder from 107,858 street view images using computer vision algorithms.""
  - ""Geo-referenced mobile phone flows between 1,642 census units are used to approximate offenders' potential spatial knowledge about target neighborhoods.""
  - ""Discrete choice models are estimated separately for burglars from disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods (N=1,972).""
  - ""The present study focuses on the city of ZG in southeast China.""
  - ""We focus on the central urban area of the city where the majority of population reside and commute and where street view images are available.""
  - ""We use communities (juweihui or cunweihui) as the unit of analysis.""
  - ""There are a total of 2,643 communities in the ZG region, with an average geographic area of 2.813km 2""
  - ""After excluding communities without street view images, we have 1,652 spatially contiguous communities in the analytical sample, with an average size of 0.958km 2 and an average population of 5,957.""
  - ""In this study, we combine police arrest data, mobile phone mobility data, street view images, POI data, and census data.""
  - ""The police arrest data record the actual burglary cases between 2017 and 2018 in the city of ZG.""
  - ""To measure the spatial knowledge between neighborhoods, we obtain mobility flows from mobile phone usage for the whole month of October 2019 from China Unicom Inc, a major telecom provider in China.""
  - ""We construct neighborhood concentrated disadvantage based on the following seven neighborhood conditions: unemployment rate, low educational attainment (high school or lower), share of non-locals, overcrowding, share of renters, average rent price, and access to tap water, bath, and kitchen.""
  - ""We model burglars' target location choice using a conditional logit specification where a burglar's decision of where to offend depends on an array of factors involving the characteristics of both the residential and potential target neighborhoods.""
  - ""The approach has been widely used in criminal decision making, residential choice, and activity space location choice literature""
  - ""The likelihood of a community being targeted for burglary reduces as its distance from burglar's home increases, more so for Non-Dis-residing burglars (reduces by a factor of 0.325 and 0.326, p<0.001) than Dis-residing burglars (OR ranges between 0.299 and 0.300, p<0.001).""
  - ""More populated destination communities are also more likely to be targeted, with one unit increase in the population logarithm leading to 98.6%-100.9% higher odds for Non-Dis-residing burglars (p<0.001) and 78.7%-82.2% higher odds for Dis-residing burglars (p<0.001).""
  - ""The presence of post-2000 newer buildings strongly predicts burglary risk for both groups of burglars with OR over 2.4 (p<0.001).""
  - ""Transportation facilitations function as crime generators with one more subway station increasing the risk of being targeted by 20% among Non-Dis burglars (p<0.05) and over 80%

among Dis burglars (p<0.001).""

</table_quotation>""","- The study focuses on the city of ZG in southeast China, specifically the central urban area, which is the study area.
- The study area size is approximately 2.813km² for each community, with an average size of 0.958km² after excluding communities without street view images.
- The data sources include police arrest data, mobile phone mobility data, street view images, POI data, and census data.
- The sampling strategy involves using communities as the unit of analysis, with a total of 1,652 spatially contiguous communities in the analytical sample.
- The independent variables include demographic variables (population density), economic variables (unemployment rate, average rent price), land use variables (residential density, commercial areas), infrastructure variables (roads, transit), distance variables (distance from burglar's home), crime opportunity variables (previous crimes, guardianship), and social variables (social cohesion, disorder).
- The study uses a conditional logit model to predict burglary location choice based on these variables."

Burglars must therefore estimate the prospective value of what they might steal on the basis of cues that are observable from the outside.""
  - ""Target availability is a second important choice criterion. Burglars will generally prefer neighborhoods with a high target density (a greater number of residences) over neighborhoods with a low target density, because the former situation allows for more and a greater variety of alternative targets than the latter situation""
  - ""At the cost side of the equation, burglars will likely avoid neighborhoods where they expect that the risk of detection and arrest is elevated, as indicated by high social cohesion and high social control""
  - ""Conversely, in terms of benefits, burglars will prefer neighborhoods with lower levels of guardianship and reduced chances of detection and arrest.""
  - ""Similar to ethnic heterogeneity, neighborhoods with higher proportions of rental units are associated with low residential stability which impedes social cohesion and social interaction, and may inhibit guardianship""
  - ""Ultimately, a specific residential unit within a particular neighborhood is the actual target of a residential burglary.""
  - ""Assessments of anticipated costs and benefits should therefore also affect target selection at the building and residence level.""
  - ""The extent to which a building is accessible is likely an important consideration when deliberating target choice""
  - ""Detached and semi-detached buildings are easier to access than terraced buildings and residences in apartment complexes because the former can be accessed both at the street side and backside""
  - ""the higher density of occupants in terraced buildings and apartment complexes may also elevate the risk of detection.""
  - ""Burglars may rely on several strategies to gauge detection and apprehension risk.""
  - ""A straightforward strategy is to assess the likelihood that someone is present in the target residence at the time of the burglary or, if the residence is part of a multi-unit building, in other residences in the building.""
  - ""More occupants in a residence may increase the likelihood of someone being present at the time of the burglary, resulting in higher natural surveillance and greater risk of detection""
  - ""targeting residences in a multi-unit housing complex could be riskier since there is more natural surveillance and neighbors could walk in on the burglary""
  - ""Burglars prefer burglarizing single-unit residences over residences in multi-unit buildings.""
  - ""Because not only the number of potential guardians is relevant but also the likelihood that guardians will actually exercise social control by intervening in the burglary or calling the police, burglars are expected to prefer buildings and residences that signal reduced levels of social control and social cohesion.""
  - ""Similar to the counterpart hypothesis at the neighborhood level (see hypothesis 4), burglars may prefer burglarizing renter-occupied residences rather than owner-occupied residences.""
  - ""Contained within crime pattern theory is also the argument that familiarity with certain places drives target selection and people are most familiar with the areas around their homes.""
  - ""Burglars are therefore expected to have better knowledge about targets near their home than about more distant targets and will therefore prefer to burglarize nearby residences over distant residences.""

- The study was conducted in the county of Dorset, UK, which is the jurisdiction for the data collection.
- The type of crime analyzed is theft from vehicles (TFV), as mentioned in the abstract and throughout the paper.

- The findings on the impact of distance and familiarity on crime location choice are quantified, showing that for every 10 minutes of travel time, the likelihood of a location being chosen decreases, while increased familiarity (measured by idiosyncratic betweenness) increases the likelihood.
- The study found that areas with more nonlocal passers-by and fewer local passers-by are more likely to be targeted, which supports the idea that burglars prefer areas where they are less likely to be recognized or deterred by local guardianship.","  - ""With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level.""

  - ""Second, we build on previous work (Davies and Johnson, 2015) and introduce to the discrete choice literature a methodological approach that aims to estimate independently how the road network influences offender awareness of crime opportunities, on the one hand, and guardian potential at particular locations, on the other.""
  - ""By following Townsley, Birks, Ruiter, et al. (2015) , we also recognize that offenders may vary in the extent to which their spatial decision-making is affected by different factors, and so we employ mixed logit statistical models to estimate parameters and how they vary across offenders.""
  - ""The remainder of this article is organized as follows.""
  - ""In the next section, theoretical perspectives and research are reviewed to introduce the theoretical model.""
  - ""The second and third sections describe the data and analytic strategy, respectively.""
  - ""The latter includes a discussion of the application of graph theory to quantify the character of the road network, as well as the statistical model employed.""
  - ""The fourth and fifth sections present and discuss the results.""
  - ""The rational choice perspective (Cornish and Clarke, 1986) describes offenders, such as burglars, as nonarbitrary decision-makers who consider (however briefly) the costs and benefits of action alternatives, including the decision of where to offend (Clarke and Felson, 1993).""
  - ""It is suggested that such decision-making will be bounded by imperfect and incomplete information, and that future choices will be informed by the outcome of previous ones (Cornish and Clarke, 1986; see also Bennett and Wright, 1984;Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991; Wright and Decker, 1994)""
  - ""Nevertheless, although choices made may not appear rational to an observer, it is assumed that selections are made that aim to maximize the perceived utility of a decision and minimize the expected costs.""
  - ""In particular, the distance an offender must travel to offend has consistently been shown by researchers to influence offender location choice in both quantitative and ethnographic studies.""
  - ""For example, offenders have consistently reported (e.g., Brown and Altman, 1981;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985;Repetto, 1974), and the results of analyses of the journey to crime (Snook, 2004;Wiles and Costello, 2000) have shown, that the likelihood of an offender selecting a location at which to offend is inversely proportional to the distance he or she must travel to reach it.""
  - ""The aim of most studies of the journey to crime has been to examine the Euclidean distance between locations (e.g., Clare, Fernandez, and Morgan, 2009), and even though this provides a good estimate of the likely cost of travel, it is clearly imperfect.""
  - ""The cost of travel is intrinsically linked to the configuration and properties (such as the vehicle speed limit) of the road network as this determines how quick and how easy it is to travel between any two locations.""
  - ""Consequently, in the current study, we expect to find the following:

Hypothesis 1: Street segments that are quicker to travel to (in terms of estimated travel time) from the burglar's home will be more likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""In addition to the fact that the selection of targets near to an offender's home location minimizes the cost of travel, this preference is expected to emerge for other reasons encapsulated by crime pattern theory (e.g., Brantingham and Brantingham, 1993).""
  - ""According to the theory, like everyone else, offenders are assumed to frequent activity nodes routinely, such as their home and workplace.""
  - ""As a consequence of doing so, they develop an awareness of these places and the routes between them.""
  - ""This is not necessary for offending, but it shapes offenders' familiarity and awareness of the criminal opportunities within these spaces.""
  - ""According to crime pattern theory, offenders are believed to prefer such opportunities to alternative targets for two reasons.""
  - ""First, offenders cannot select targets of which they are not aware (Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985).""
  - ""And, second, targeting locations about which something is known reduces uncertainty about the likely outcome of that choice (Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994).""
  - ""As such, we predict the following:

Hypothesis 2: Street segments that are more likely to be familiar to an offender are more likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""In previous studies, scholars have assumed that the distance between a location and an offender's routine activity nodes (e.g., the home) provides a reasonable estimate of that location's familiarity.""
  - ""This assumption is not unreasonable as the findings from qualitative research with burglars have revealed that they are typically most familiar with areas that are closest to their home locations (e.g., Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985).""
  - ""Nevertheless, at the street segment level, an individual's familiarity with locations will be more nuanced than this, and it is likely to be a function of how frequently he or she travels to or through them (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1993;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985).""
  - ""Although distance will influence this awareness, so too will the configuration of the road network because this affects the likelihood that an individual will travel along a particular street to reach that or other locations (e.g., Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994).""
  - ""Some streets (such as major roads) may feature in many journeys, whereas others less so (cul de sacs and dead ends, for instance).""
  - ""On the whole, streets rarely traveled will be less familiar than those commonly used.""
  - ""Even though it is not possible to determine which streets offenders travel during their routine activities without collecting extensive primary data, it is possible to employ techniques from graph theory to estimate which routes and, hence, which street segments, they are most likely to use and be familiar with (near to activity nodes such as their home location).""
  - ""To do this, for each offender, we compute a novel idiosyncratic variation of the graph theory metric betweenness.""
  - ""Betweenness (which is discussed in more detail later in the article) has been used elsewhere (e.g., Davies and Johnson, 2015) to estimate overall movement potential through the road network.""
  - ""Our idiosyncratic variant is intended to estimate how likely each offender is to use particular street segments and, hence, to develop an awareness of them.""
  - ""Consequently, for hypothesis 2, we specifically predict that offenders are most likely to commit offenses on those street segments with high idiosyncratic betweenness values.""
  - ""The configuration of the road network also influences the movement of people going about their everyday activities (e.g., Hillier, 2007;Penn, 2003)-people who (in the case of residential burglary) have the potential to provide ambient guardianship (Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991;Felson, 1994) or to regulate behavior (Miethe and Meier, 1994).""
  - ""Nevertheless, the potential role of passers-by is more complex than simply a function of their presence or absence.""
  - ""To explain, consider two theories of urban design. In the case of the first, Jacobs (1961) suggested that guardianship is provided by everyone not engaged in criminal activity who is present on a street.""
  - ""She suggested that their presence provides ""eyes on the street"" and that this ""natural surveillance"" has the potential to deter crime.""
  - ""Yet, according to Newman's (1972) defensible space perspective (see also Coleman, 1985), whether the ambient population deters crime depends on exactly who is present and where they are.""
  - ""According to this perspective, territoriality, which is communicated by environmental cues regarding who (such as residents) is likely to be responsible for and expected to use (or pass through) a space, plays a key role.""
  - ""Where it exists, for example, through the segregation of public and private spaces, it ""may make a stranger more obvious and residents more watchful"" (Newman, 1980: 142)""
  - ""In contrast, on streets where territoriality is lacking, the attendant guardianship (potential) is expected to be diminished as there will be ambiguity as to who is responsible for that space.""
  - ""Although both perspectives champion similar concepts, they principally differ in terms of how they predict the movement of nonlocals along a street to influence crime risk.""
  - ""For the former, anyone, including nonlocals, can provide additional guardianship and this should deter crime.""
  - ""In contrast, according to the latter, on streets where there are large flows of nonlocals, anonymity will be increased and this will be detrimental to the informal guardianship provided by those who are local and live on or nearby that street, or might otherwise feel responsible for it.""
  - ""The findings of quantitative research intended to test these two theories are somewhat mixed and can be divided into two branches.""
  - ""The first, which includes area-level (White, 1990) and more recently street-level studies (Armitage, 2007;Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994;Johnson and Bowers, 2010;Rengert and Wasilchick, 2000), generally find that locations that are expected to have greater through movement are more likely to experience crime.""
  - ""In most of these studies, researchers have used simple ordinal or categorical variables (e.g., the number of other roads a street directly intersects, or major versus minor road categorizations) as proxies for traffic levels (Beavon, Brantingham, and Brantingham, 1994;Johnson and Bowers, 2010;White, 1990), but in recent studies, researchers (Davies and Johnson, 2015) have used more sophisticated metrics (see the Graph Theory section) and have come to the same conclusions.""
  - ""The second branch of research involves metrics computed with the space syntax methodology.""
  - ""Researchers who have used this approach have employed a form of graph theory, but generally, they have found opposing findings to those discussed earlier (e.g., Hillier, 2004;Shu, 2000).""
  - ""That is, consistent with Jacob's (1961) ideas, at locations that are expected to possess greater volumes of passers-by, less crime is observed.""
  - ""That said, in some studies, research teams have employed the space syntax methodology and have reported different results.""
  - ""For example, Hillier and Sahbaz (2009) found that streets that were characterized as being likely used for more localized movements tended to experience less crime (see also Nubani and Wineman, 2005).""
  - ""Moreover, many studies that use the space syntax methodology have been weaker in terms of the statistical methods applied (for an extended discussion, see Summers and Johnson, 2016), often having relied on descriptive statistics (Shu, 2000) or having failed to account for (any) other predictor variables known to influence crime (Hillier, 2004;Hillier and Sahbaz, 2009).""
  - ""It must also be noted that no previous research of this kind has been designed to account for where offenders reside, and so the influence of offender decision-making has been conflated in these studies.""
  - ""The aim of qualitative research (e.g., Cromwell, Olson, and Avery, 1991; Wright and Decker, 1994) is to provide more insight from the offender's perspective.""
  - ""Qualitative research suggests that most (but not all) offenders avoid targeting locations where they are likely to be seen by neighbors or others (Bennett and Wright, 1984).""
  - ""Nevertheless, in such studies, researchers have not, as far as we are aware, examined how the configuration of the road network affects offender perceptions of this type of guardianship.""
  - ""On the basis of the preceding text, we consider the following hypotheses (detailed descriptions of the variables derived to test hypotheses are provided later in the article).""
  - ""First, in support of the ""eyes on the street"" perspective where all passer-by guardianship is beneficial: Hypothesis 3: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of any passers-by (estimated with a metric of overall pedestrian betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""Second, motivated by both Jacob's ""eyes on the street"" and Newman's ""defensible space"" perspectives, where local passer-by guardianship is expected to be beneficial: Hypothesis 4: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of local passers-by (estimated with a metric of local betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""Third, as suggested by the defensible space but not by the ""eyes on the street"" perspective:

Hypothesis 5: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of nonlocal passers-by (estimated with a metric of nonlocal betweenness) is higher are more likely to be selected for burglary.""
  - ""Although these ideas best apply to pedestrian movement, it is also important to consider vehicular movements.""
  - ""In their study of offender decision-making, Bennett and Wright (1984) showed convicted burglars video recordings of 36 different homes and then asked them to indicate which they would target and why.""
  - ""Among the factors offenders identified as influencing their choices was the type of road, with busy roads being avoided as ""the offender might be seen by drivers of passing cars"" (p. 64).""
  - ""Thus: Hypothesis 6: Street segments for which the potential for the through-movement of vehicular passers-by (estimated with a metric of overall vehicular betweenness) is higher are less likely to be selected for a burglary.""
  - ""Although our focus in this article concerns the role of the road network on criminal location choice, other factors will clearly influence offender decision-making and need to be accounted for.""
  - ""First, according to social disorganization (Shaw and McKay, 1942) and related theories (e.g., Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush, 2001;Sampson and Groves, 1989;Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997), the extent to which residents can exert informal social control to deter crime is influenced by how closely knit their neighborhood is.""
  - ""Less cohesive neighborhoods lack communal ties either because (for example) they are transient or because residents do not share common values.""
  - ""According to this theory, in such communities, residents may not feel responsible for their neighborhood and so will be less willing to act collectively as guardians against crime.""
  - ""In previous studies of the kind described here (e.g., Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005;Clare, Fernandez, and Morgan, 2009), levels of social disorganization have been estimated by researchers using census data that characterize the (lack of) stability, or heterogeneity, of neighborhoods with variables such as population turnover, ethnic diversity (e.g., Miethe and Meier, 1994), and socioeconomic diversity (Johnson and Summers, 2015).""
  - ""In the current study, we control for these factors in the analyses that follow.""
  - ""Offense location choices are also likely influenced by the type of targets available.""
  - ""For example, as suggested elsewhere (Maguire and Bennett, 1982;Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985), burglars are financially motivated and are therefore likely to prefer more affluent dwellings where greater proceeds are expected.""
  - ""Conversely, it is also likely that more affluent dwellings will have better security measures and are therefore likely to be more difficult to break into.""
  - ""As such, and following the approach taken in previous studies (e.g., Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), the affluence of each possible target location is accounted for in the analyses presented.""
  - ""Finally, it is important to note that even if an offender chooses targets randomly, roads with more homes are more likely to be selected.""
  - ""To account for this, the number of dwellings on a street segment is also included as a control variable.""",,"QUOTES:

- ""With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level.""
- ""Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship.""
- ""As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices.""
- ""And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk.""
- ""Our findings also demonstrate that 'taste' preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.""
- ""The aim of prior research has been to examine the role of the road network on crime, but it has failed to isolate the influence of these two mechanisms.""
- ""To address these shortcomings, in this article, we make several novel contributions.""
- ""We use a discrete choice approach (McFadden, 1974), or more accurately an offense location choice approach (Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta, 2005), to estimate empirically how the opportunities that are targeted by burglars differ from those that are not.""
- ""Our research differs from previous studies of offender spatial decision-making in two important ways.""
- ""First, in most previous studies, scholars have examined offender location choice at the area level (for the exceptions, see Bernasco, 2010b, and Vandeviver et al., 2015).""
- ""Second, we build on previous work (Davies and Johnson, 2015) and introduce to the discrete choice literature a methodological approach that aims to estimate independently how the road network influences offender awareness of crime opportunities, on the one hand, and guardian potential at particular locations, on the other.""
- ""By following Townsley, Birks, Ruiter, et al. (2015), we also recognize that offenders may vary in the extent to which their spatial decision-making is affected by different factors, and so we employ mixed logit statistical models to estimate parameters and how they vary across offenders.""
- ""The rational choice perspective (Cornish and Clarke, 1986) describes offenders, such as burglars, as nonarbitrary decision-makers who consider (however briefly) the costs and benefits of action alternatives, including the decision of where to offend (Clarke and Felson, 1993).""
- ""It is suggested that such decision-making will be bounded by imperfect and incomplete information, and that future choices will be informed by the outcome of previous ones (Cornish and Clarke, 1986; see also Bennett and Wright, 1984;Cromwell, Olson, and Avary, 1991; Wright and Decker, 1994).""
- ""Nevertheless, although choices made may not appear rational to an observer, it is assumed that selections are made that aim to maximize the perceived utility of a decision and minimize the expected costs.""

REASONING:

1. The paper uses a mixed logit model to analyze residential burglaries at the street segment level. This indicates that the dependent variable is likely related to the occurrence of burglaries on street segments.

2. The paper develops novel graph theory metrics to estimate offender awareness and ambient guardianship. These metrics are likely independent variables used to predict burglary occurrences.

3. The paper mentions significant predictors of burglary location choices, including offender familiarity and effort. These are likely independent variables.

4. The concept of defensible space and pedestrian traffic's influence on burglary risk suggests that pedestrian traffic is another independent variable.

5. The tables at the end of the paper likely contain detailed information about the variables used in the study, including both dependent and independent variables.

6. The paper discusses various factors influencing offender decision-making, such as travel time and awareness of street segments, which are likely operationalized as independent variables.

7.

Although there may be greater risks by doing this, for example of being identified, doing so should need less effort in terms of reaching or returning from the target. These locations should also be preferred as they will be more familiar and so there is less uncertainty about the risks. Offenders are therefore expected to more likely offend in neighbourhoods close to their homes.""
  - ""Distance from the city centre: Due to the concentration of facilities and services in or near most city centres, including in the study area, it is expected to be visited more often, including by offenders, than equivalent other areas. The city centre, and nearby areas, are therefore expected to be more likely to appear in an offender's awareness space and the opportunities to be more familiar. Offenders are therefore expected to more likely offend in neighbourhoods closer to the city centre.""
  - ""Ethnic heterogeneity: Various qualitative research describes acquisitive offenders as preferring to offend in socially disorganised neighbourhoods (Bennett et al., 1984;Wright and Decker, 2002). Therefore, because ethnic heterogeneity will likely impede social ties from forming, for example because of cultural or linguistic differences, it is expected offenders are more likely to offend in more ethnically diverse neighbourhoods.""
  - ""Socioeconomic heterogeneity: Like ethnic heterogeneity, the forming of social ties is also likely to be inhibited from forming when residents are from very different socioeconomic statuses (Hirschfield and Bowers, 1997). As such, it is expected that offenders are more likely to offend in more socioeconomically diverse neighbourhoods.""
  - ""Residential Churn: Similar to ethnic and socioeconomic heterogeneity, because neighbourhoods with elevated levels of resident turnover would be expected to inhibit community from forming, it is expected that offenders are more likely to offend in neighbourhoods with higher residential churn.""
  - ""Affluence: As suggested elsewhere (Rengert and Wasilchick, 1985;Light et al., 1993;Wright and Decker, 2002), acquisitive offenders are primarily driven by financial benefit. They would therefore be expected to be more likely to offend in more affluent neighbourhoods where more valuable targets are more likely to be found. However, on the other hand, because more valuable targets may be better secured against crime, it is also possible that offenders would be more likely to offend in less affluent neighbourhoods where targets which would be expected to have less security are more likely to be found.""
  - ""Previous offence locations (for repeat offenders): Because offending in a location will likely either involve gathering information about the area or the targets, these areas are likely to be more familiar, particularly in an offending context, to the offender and so require less effort to reconnaissance and there will be less uncertainty or risk about offending (e.g. Johnson et al., 2009;Bernasco et al., 2015;Lammers et al., 2015; Van Sleeuwen et al., 2018) .

However, on the other hand, because more valuable targets may be better secured against crime, it is also possible that offenders would be more likely to offend in less affluent neighbourhoods where targets which would be expected to have less security are more likely to be found.""
  - ""Previous offence locations (for repeat offenders): Because offending in a location will likely either involve gathering information about the area or the targets, these areas are likely to be more familiar, particularly in an offending context, to the offender and so require less effort to reconnaissance and there will be less uncertainty or risk about offending (e.g. Johnson et al., 2009;Bernasco et al., 2015;Lammers et al., 2015; Van Sleeuwen et al., 2018) . Offenders would therefore be expected to be more likely to offend in area if they have offended there previously.""
  - ""Number of potential targets: Lastly, and although also included as a control, even if offenders select targets randomly, then neighbourhoods with larger numbers of potential targets are more likely to be selected for an offence. As such, it is expected that offenders are more likely to offend in neighbourhoods with greater numbers of potential targets.""
  - ""For these analyses, revealed preference data for 1,105 recorded3 and solved4 SAC in York committed by 687 offenders living in York between April 2008 and March 2012 were collected.""
  - ""The three discrete choice models of offence location choices in these analyses are all computed in Stata 14 (StataCorp, 2015).""",,"- The paper discusses various independent variables used in the final model to analyze offence location choices. These variables are categorized into different types based on their nature and relevance to the study.
- **Demographic variables**: The paper does not explicitly mention demographic variables like population density, age, or household size in the context of the final model.
- **Economic variables**: Affluence is considered an economic variable, as it relates to property values and the financial motivation of offenders.
- **Land use variables**: The paper does not explicitly mention land use variables such as residential density or commercial areas.
- **Infrastructure variables**: The paper does not explicitly mention infrastructure variables like roads or transit.
- **Distance variables**: Distance from the offender's home and distance to the city center are considered distance variables.
- **Crime opportunity variables**: Previous offence location and the number of potential targets are considered crime opportunity variables.
- **Social variables**: Ethnic heterogeneity, socioeconomic heterogeneity, and residential churn are considered social variables, as they relate to social cohesion and disorder.

- The study area is specified as the city of York, UK, covering approximately 270 km².

- Data sources for the independent variables include the 2011 UK Census for social disorganization and number of potential targets, and the UK Land Registry for affluence.

- The sampling strategy involves using a subset of offenders and offences, with a choice set limited to the city of York. The paper discusses computational burdens and the need to limit alternatives for analysis.

- The spatial resolution is described as census blocks with an average size of 140 m x 140 m, which are about 30 times smaller than census tracts.
- The data collection period is from 1996 through 1998, as recorded by the Chicago Police Department.
- The study is conducted in the city of Chicago, which serves as the study site.
- The type of crime analyzed is street robbery.
- The discrete choice model used is the multinomial logit model, with an extension to a universal logit model to account for spatial spillover effects.
- The sampling approach for alternatives involves a random sample of 6000 census blocks per robbery, which is approximately a quarter of the total blocks.
- Independent variables include characteristics of census blocks such as the presence of small businesses, illegal market activities, accessibility measures, and racial/ethnic composition. These are derived from police records and census data.
- The average population per spatial unit (census block) is approximately 118 residents.
- The choice of spatial unit of analysis is the census block, justified by the need to minimize aggregation bias and to capture fine-grained spatial decisions.
- Data sources include police incident reports and census data.
- Limitations mentioned include the lack of data on factors that could deter robbers and the assumption that robbers know the attributes of all census blocks.
- Main findings related to SUoA size or model performance include that street robbers prefer blocks near their homes and those with matching racial/ethnic backgrounds, and that robbery-attracting effects spill over to adjacent blocks.","  - ""Empirically, it was demonstrated that street robbers living in Chicago are most likely to attack on easily accessible blocks, where legal and illegal cash economies are present.""

  - ""It was also shown that the robbery attracting effects of cash economies and accessibility spill over to adjacent blocks, but not beyond.""",,"- The study uses a discrete choice framework to analyze how street robbers decide on where to attack their victims, focusing on the criteria that motivate these location decisions.
- The main findings include that street robbers prefer locations that are easily accessible and have both legal and illegal cash economies, which attract potential victims with valuable items.
- The study also highlights that these preferences spill over to adjacent blocks, indicating a spatial agglomeration effect where the presence of attractive features in one block influences the attractiveness of nearby blocks.
- Additionally, the study finds that robbers tend to prefer locations close to their own homes and within areas where the racial or ethnic majority matches their own, suggesting a preference for familiar and socially comfortable environments.","  - ""we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers.""

  - ""The purpose of this multiple methods study was to enhance our understanding of how dealers in general, and those doing business in downtown Amsterdam in particular, decide on where to solicit customers and sell them drugs.""",,"- The spatial unit of analysis (SUoA) used in the study is ""street segments,"" which are described as small enough to be overseen and overheard from a single point. This choice allows for detailed measurement and analysis of environmental features.
- The study was conducted in the 1012 postal code area of downtown Amsterdam, which includes the Red Light District, a well-known area with a high concentration of legal indoor prostitution services.
- The data collection took place between April 2009 and May 2010, as indicated by the recruitment period for the study subjects.
- The type of crime analyzed is ""drug crime,"" specifically illicit drug dealing in an open-air drug market.
- The study used a ""multinomial logit model"" to analyze location choices, which is a type of discrete choice model.

- The study does not mention the population per spatial unit, focusing instead on the characteristics of the street segments.
- The choice of SUoA as street segments is justified by their ability to capture relevant environmental features and their alignment with recent research advocating for small spatial units of analysis.
- Data sources used include interviews with drug dealers and systematic observations of street segments.
- Limitations mentioned include the coarseness of street segments as units of analysis and the variability of their characteristics over time, suggesting that even smaller units might be more appropriate for future research.

  - ""The quantitative findings demonstrate that the dealers who were interviewed displayed a tendency to solicit at locations where potential customers congregate but did not seem to be deterred by the police or other sources of social control.""
  - ""the results of the quantitative analysis tentatively confirm the relevance of potential customer density as a location choice criterion.""
  - ""An unexpected finding in the analysis of the answers to the open interview questions is the apparent lack of effectiveness of social control, in general, and formal social control in particular.""
  - ""The results of the qualitative analysis provide additional insights into the effects of formal social control on location choices.""

- Observations were conducted by trained students over a specific period, with each segment taking approximately 15 minutes to observe.
- Data analysis included both qualitative and quantitative techniques, with a focus on bivariate relations due to the small sample size.
- The study used a multinomial logit model to analyze location choices, although it was noted that the sample size was too small for statistical inference.","  - ""The two main features that distinguish our study from prior work on the geography of drug dealing are the detailed spatial scale of analysis and the emphasis on multiple methods.""
  - ""We hypothesize that in searching locations to solicit customers and in searching locations to actually exchange drugs for money, dealers consider two general factors.""
  - ""The first factor is labeled potential customer density. It is measured by the number of potential customer attractors, the activity level, and the accessibility of the location.""
  - ""The second factor is labeled social control. Social control is measured by the presence of formal and informal agents of social control (people who are likely to intervene in dealing when they notice it, for example, residents, police offenders, or shop managers), by territoriality and by the absence of social disorder.""

   - Primary sources: Google Street View, Community survey
   - Note: Variables from 2009

4. Sampling Strategy Details:
   - Case-control design
   - 300 single houses (150 burglarized, 150 non-burglarized)
   - Grouped by neighborhood

5. Population Information:
   - Not mentioned","  - ""Collecting fresh, micro-level data using Google Street View (GSV) as a tool of Systematic Social Observation (SSO), we utilise a case-control design to isolate property-level effects.""
  - ""Analysis is carried out using conditional logistic regression.""
  - ""The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""For this study, a selection of 150 dwellings that were burglarised during daylight hours in 2009 is made from geocoded, timestamped data from The Hague Police Force, the Netherlands.""
  - ""The physical characteristics of these residential units and their immediate surrounding area are measured through Systematic Social Observation (SSO), using Google Maps and its built-in virtual reality tool, Google Street View (GSV).2""
  - ""The non-burglarised control group consists of a further 155 residential homes randomly sampled from the BAG single houses dataset.""
  - ""the final sample used for analysis therefore consisted of 300 single houses, evenly split between burglarised and non-burglarised dwellings.""
  - ""The items collected using SSO were selected for the purposes of objectively measuring the four principle concepts deemed particularly prominent in offender-based research.""
  - ""Property surveillability was measured by three items, namely (1) the number of windows from neighbouring residential units with a direct view of the front ground floor, (2) the distance between the property and the building on the other side of the street, and (3) the visibility of the front door from the street.""
  - ""Property accessibility was measured through seven items, namely (1) whether the property was at the end of a row of properties, (2) number of boundaries the property shared with public areas, (3) whether the private space of the property could be sealed off with physical barriers, (4) whether the property has a burglar alarm, (5) whether the property was setback from the street, (6) the age of the building and ( 7) whether the property had amenities, such as plant pots and benches, on public space directly outside the unit.""
  - ""Wealth was measured with three items, namely (1) whether the property had a garage, (2) the size of the property in square metres, and (3) the external condition of the property.""
  - ""Ease of escape was measured with three items, namely (1) the distance between the property and the nearest main road, (2) the distance between the property and the nearest street corner, and (3) the number of escape routes, including footpaths, leading off the street segment.""
  - ""Three variables were used as control variables. One binary variable indicated whether there was a business present in the immediate surrounding area open during daylight hours: we aimed to control for the 'eyes on the street' that nearby businesses might generate.""
  - ""The data collection technique is not without its drawbacks. The inability of the Google Car to capture isolated properties inevitably leads to a bias sample, as these cannot be coded.""
  - ""The results from this study indicate that the behaviour of burglars out on the street does, on the whole, concur with the claims by participants in experimental scenarios or interviews in previous research.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=6 table_on_page=1>```markdown

- The independent variables are categorized into four main groups: surveillability, accessibility, wealth, and ease of escape. Each of these categories is further broken down into specific items that were measured.
- Surveillability includes items such as the number of windows with a direct view, distance to neighboring buildings, and front door visibility.
- Accessibility includes items such as being at the end of a row, number of public boundaries, presence of physical barriers, burglar alarm, setback from the street, age of the building, and presence of amenities.
- Wealth is measured by the presence of a garage, property size, and external condition.
- Ease of escape includes distance to main road, distance to street corner, and number of escape routes.
- Control variables include business presence, mixed land-use, and house type.
- The tables at the end of the paper provide additional details on these variables, including their means, standard deviations, and ranges.","  - ""The ease of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are all positively related to burglary risk.""
  - ""There is no evidence that indications of resident wealth are related to the likelihood of victimisation, or that the effect of surveillability varies depending on the extent of collective efficacy in a neighbourhood.""
  - ""The physical characteristics of these residential units and their immediate surrounding area are measured through Systematic Social Observation (SSO), using Google Maps and its built-in virtual reality tool, Google Street View (GSV).2""
  - ""Neighbourhood-level variables are sourced from a community survey conducted in The Hague.""
  - ""The outcome variable in this study was whether or not a residential unit was burgled in The Hague during the year 2009.""
  - ""The explanatory variables on the property-level were primarily collected based a variety of GSV images, which allows users to 'move' up and down the street to get different angles of the property, including nearby streets from which the unit is visible.""
  - ""The items collected using SSO were selected for the purposes of objectively measuring the four principle concepts deemed particularly prominent in offender-based research.""
  - ""Property surveillability was measured by three items, namely (1) the number of windows from neighbouring residential units with a direct view of the front ground floor, (2) the distance between the property and the building on the other side of the street, and (3) the visibility of the front door from the street.""
  - ""Property accessibility was measured through seven items, namely (1) whether the property was at the end of a row of properties, (2) number of boundaries the property shared with public areas, (3) whether the private space of the property could be sealed off with physical barriers, (4) whether the property has a burglar alarm, (5) whether the property was setback from the street, (6) the age of the building and ( 7) whether the property had amenities, such as plant pots and benches, on public space directly outside the unit.""
  - ""Wealth was measured with three items, namely (1) whether the property had a garage, (2) the size of the property in square metres, and (3) the external condition of the property.""
  - ""Ease of escape was measured with three items, namely (1) the distance between the property and the nearest main road, (2) the distance between the property and the nearest street corner, and (3) the number of escape routes, including footpaths, leading off the street segment.""
  - ""Three variables were used as control variables. One binary variable indicated whether there was a business present in the immediate surrounding area open during daylight hours: we aimed to control for the 'eyes on the street' that nearby businesses might generate. Mixed land-use was a binary variable indicating whether the immediate surrounding area had land usage beyond that of purely residential, such as a car park. House type was a categorical variable stating whether the house was terraced, semi-detached, or detached.""
  - ""the data used for the neighbourhood-level construct was retrieved courtesy of Bruinsma et al. (2013), gathered from the community survey which contained five questions on social trust and six questions on informal social control""
  - ""the final sample used for analysis therefore consisted of 300 single houses, evenly split between burglarised and non-burglarised dwellings.""
  - ""the study considers whether the effects of these property-level attributes vary depending on the neighbourhood in which residences are nested.""",,"- The paper categorizes independent variables into several types, focusing on property-level characteristics that influence burglary risk. These include surveillability, accessibility, wealth indicators, and ease of escape.
- Demographic variables are not explicitly mentioned in the context of the final model.
- Economic variables are represented by wealth indicators, but the study found no significant relationship between these and burglary risk.
- Land use variables are considered through mixed land-use as a control variable.
- Infrastructure variables are not directly mentioned, but aspects like the distance to main roads and street corners relate to ease of escape.
- Distance variables are included in the ease of escape category, such as the distance to the nearest main road and street corner.
- Crime opportunity variables are central to the study, focusing on surveillability, accessibility, and ease of escape.
- Social variables are considered through collective efficacy, sourced from a community survey.
- The study area is The Hague, with a focus on single-family homes.
- Data sources include Google Street View for property-level data and a community survey for neighborhood-level data.
- The sampling strategy involved a case-control design, comparing burglarized and non-burglarized homes within neighborhoods.
- Population information is not detailed in terms of density or total population."
