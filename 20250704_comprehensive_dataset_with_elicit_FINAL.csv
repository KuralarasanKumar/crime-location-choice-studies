The city of Tampa is divided into 334 block groups. The average area per block group was estimated by dividing the total area of Tampa (455 km²) by the total number of block groups (334), resulting in an average of approximately 1.36 km² per block group. Although the analysis in the study was conducted on 304 block groups due to data availability, the average size was calculated using all 334 block groups to reflect the full spatial division of the city.",https://doi.org/10.1177/00111287211067177,00111287,Crime and Delinquency,69,11,1,Traveling Alone or Together?
