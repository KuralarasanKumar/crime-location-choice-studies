TI  - Target Selection Models with Preference Variation Between Offenders
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders.
   Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age.
   Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders.
   This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.

TI  - A discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection at the house-level
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This article studies how burglars select a house to burglarize. We draw on the rational choice perspective to investigate how burglars select a target by relying on house-related attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk. It extends current applications of the discrete spatial choice framework to burglary target selection by adopting the house as the spatial unit of analysis and studies burglars' target selection process in a larger and more diverse study area than that of earlier studies. Using data on 650 residential burglaries and on approximately 500,000 residential properties in the Belgian province East Flanders, we consider a discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection to establish which house-related attributes influence burglars' target selection process. Our findings demonstrate that terraced houses, houses without a garage, houses that have not been outfitted with a central heating and/or air-conditioning system and houses nearby burglars' residences are more likely to be selected. Overall, our analysis suggests that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets while higher perceived rewards actually decrease the odds of a house being burglarized. Risk-related attributes are unimportant for burglars' target choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CO-OFFENDERS' CRIME LOCATION CHOICE: DO CO-OFFENDING GROUPS COMMIT CRIMES IN THEIR <i>SHARED</i> AWARENESS SPACE?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: the extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders.

TI  - Modeling Micro-Level Crime Location Choice: Application of the Discrete Choice Framework to Crime at Places
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.

TI  - The Importance of Importance Sampling: Exploring Methods of Sampling from Alternatives in Discrete Choice Models of Crime Location Choice
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders' choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders' pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members' homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders' activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders' prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders' spatial decision making.

TI  - "Location, Location, Location": Effects of Neighborhood and House Attributes on Burglars' Target Selection
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars' choice of residence to burglarize. Methods We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars' target choice in a conditional logit model. Results Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars' target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.

TI  - Familiar Locations and Similar Activities: Examining the Contributions of Reliable and Relevant Knowledge in Offenders' Crime Location Choices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REVIEW
AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders' knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders' pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members' home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge-where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities-and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.

TI  - Investigating the effect of people on the street and streetscape physical environment on the location choice of street theft crime offenders using street view images and a discrete spatial choice model
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature.

TI  - An economy of choice? Terrorist decision-making and criminological rational choice theories reconsidered
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats.

TI  - Security Theatrics: The Role of Visual Cues in Simulated Attacker Target Selection
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Visibly deterring potential adversaries is central to security risk assessment and planning operations within many agencies including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Many visible security elements are employed by TSA toward these goals. Questions remain whether these elements deter/displace attackers, and answers are elusive in these data-poor contexts. Using a novel adversarial exercise with a national sample, our paired conjoint experiment across visibly-changing aviation environments finds the majority of tested security infrastructure visibly deterred simulated adversaries. Canine officer presence deterred, biometric scanners induced, and queue density had no appreciable effect upon target selection. Our findings offer useful criminological insights, clear policy applications, and novel quantitative methods for assessing visible deterrent processes in limited data environments.

TI  - ROLE OF THE STREET NETWORK IN BURGLARS' SPATIAL DECISION-MAKING
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that taste preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.

TI  - The usefulness of past crime data as an attractiveness index for residential burglars
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND OFFENDER PROFILING
AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

TI  - Burglar Target Selection: A Cross-national Comparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions.
   Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments.
   Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions.
   Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.

TI  - Modelling the spatial decision making of terrorists: The discrete choice approach
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This is the first study to apply a discrete choice model to understand terrorist spatial decision making. The findings support the proposition that terrorists make decisions that are guided by rationality and act in a similar way to urban criminals. A conditional logistic regression ascertained which characteristics increased the likelihood that an area would be selected as a target, using a dataset of attacks carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Belfast over a twenty-year period. An increase in distance from the terrorises home to the attack site decreased the likelihood that an area would be chosen and an area was more likely to be chosen if it contained a major road, police station or military base.

TI  - FAMILY MATTERS: EFFECTS OF FAMILY MEMBERS' RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

TI  - Location Choice of Snatching Offenders in Chennai City
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.

TI  - Graffiti Writers Choose Locations That Optimize Exposure
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - We investigate the spatial decision-making of graffiti writers when selecting target locations, examining how street segment characteristics influence exposure. Extending the rational choice perspective to expressive offending, we collected data through Systematic Social Observation in Ghent's city center in November 2017, covering 12,655 graffiti instances across 2,233 street segments. The SSO involved counting graffiti items and public facilities likely to attract crowds, and measuring street network centrality. Conditional logit models assessed the impact of these characteristics on graffiti location choices. Results show that street network centrality and the presence of bars, night shops, residential units, and schools significantly increased graffiti writers' preferences. Our findings suggest that graffiti writers aim to maximize exposure, highlighting the rational choice perspective's relevance for expressive offending.

TI  - Serendipity in Robbery Target Selection
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

TI  - Learning where to offend: Effects of past on future burglary locations
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted. Using data in 3337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before. This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent. Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Do Street Robbery Location Choices Vary Over Time of Day or Day of Week? A Test in Chicago
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

TI  - Target selection in rapists: The role of environmental and contextual factors
T2  - AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR
AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection.

TI  - A Time for a Crime: Temporal Aspects of Repeat Offenders' Crime Location Choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders' crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times.
   Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.
   Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime.
   Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.

TI  - A decision model for spatial site selection by criminals: A foundation for law enforcement decision support
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS
AB  - Crime analysis uses past crime data to predict future crime locations and times. Typically this analysis relies on hot spot models that show clusters of criminal events based on past locations of these events. It does not consider the decision making processes of criminals as human initiated events susceptible to analysis using spatial choice models. This paper analyzes criminal incidents as spatial choice processes. Spatial choice analysis can be used to discover the distribution of people's behaviors in space and time. Two adjusted spatial choice models that include models of decision making processes are presented. The comparison results show that adjusted spatial choice models provide efficient and accurate predictions of future crime patterns and can be used as the basis for a law enforcement decision support system. This paper also extends spatial choice modeling to include the class of problems where the decision makers' preferences are derived indirectly through incident reports rather than directly through survey instruments.

TI  - Testing Ecological Theories of Offender Spatial Decision Making Using a Discrete Choice Model
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

TI  - Victims' Routine Activities and Sex Offenders' Target Selection Scripts: A Latent Class Analysis
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - This study investigates target selection scripts of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sex crimes on stranger victims. Using latent class analysis, three target selection scripts were identified based on the victim's activities prior to the crime, each presenting two different tracks: (1) the Home script, which includes the (a) intrusion track and the (b) invited track, (2) the Outdoor script, which includes the (a) noncoercive track and the (b) coercive track, and (3) the Social script, which includes the (a) onsite track and the (b) off-site track. The scripts identified appeared to be used by both sexual aggressors of children and sexual aggressors of adults. In addition, a high proportion of crime switching was found among the identified scripts, with half of the 72 offenders switching scripts at least once. The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed.

TI  - BITING ONCE, TWICE: THE INFLUENCE OF PRIOR ON SUBSEQUENT CRIME LOCATION CHOICE
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.

TI  - How do residential burglars select target areas? A new approach to the analysis of criminal location choice
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed.

TI  - Do Migrant and Native Robbers Target Different Places?
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers' crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers' crime location choices, but not native robbers'. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

TI  - Exploring and Understanding Differences Between Deliberate and Impulsive Male and Female Burglars
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Relying on rational choice theory, we compare burglars' varying levels of offense planning to understand differences among types of burglars. Surveys were collected from a sample of incarcerated male and female burglars in three states. Participants answered questions detailing aspects of a burglary including motivations, target selection, deterrents, and techniques. Comparisons were made between 119 deliberate (32%) and 257 impulsive (68%) burglars. Deliberate burglars focused on obtaining cash, whereas impulsive burglars were more motivated by drug habits. Impulsive burglars were more easily dissuaded from a target when multiple obstacles are present. Burglars consider how many obstacles they may have to overcome, providing support for rational choice-based, situational crime prevention efforts. Differences in burglar motivation emerged and are discussed.

TI  - Burglars blocked by barriers? The impact of physical and social barriers on residential burglars' target location choices in China
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Based on an offender spatial decision-making perspective, this burglary target location choice study aims to understand how physical and social barriers affect why residential burglars commit their crimes at particular locations in a major Chinese city. Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes.

TI  - Ambient population and surveillance cameras: The guardianship role in street robbers' crime location choice
T2  - CITIES
AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction.

TI  - Modelling taste heterogeneity regarding offence location choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING
AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences.

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour.

TI  - The usefulness of measuring spatial opportunity structures for tracking down offenders: A theoretical analysis of geographic offender profiling using simulation studies
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY CRIME & LAW
AB  - Geographic offender profiling (GOP) is an investigative activity aimed at locating an offender's residence on the basis of where he or she commits offences. Current tools that assist in GOP assume that spatial opportunity structures for crime are uniform: they assume that potential targets are evenly distributed in space, and that potential targets are equally attractive everywhere. In addition, they assume that travel distance is the only criterion that offenders consider when choosing a crime site. This paper demonstrates that, with the help of an extended target selection model, GOP tools could be improved if they measured and utilized spatial variation in criminal opportunity structures. The results of a computer simulation study illustrate this finding.

TI  - Radicalized Environmental Extremism and Situational Decision Making
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objective: In this study, we investigate extremists' appraisals of and sensitivity to perceived sanction risk during the commission of arson. We pay specific attention to the decision-making processes of extremists leading up to and during the offending opportunity. Methods: We examined data collected from self-reported communiques (n = 275) describing acts of arson committed by radical environmental extremists. Results: We found that extremists, like other criminals, are sensitive to situational factors that affect the certainty of apprehension. Additionally, extremists work to reduce the risk of detection by engaging in crime-specific risk management techniques prior to and during the offending opportunity. Conclusions: Analysis of the communiques is consistent with recent works on extremism, situational crime prevention, and restrictive deterrence. We discuss our findings in the context of rational choice and situational crime prevention theory and the advancement of preventative policies aimed at ideological and political crime.

TI  - Traveling Alone or Together? Neighborhood Context on Individual and Group Juvenile and Adult Burglary Decisions
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions.

TI  - WHERE OFFENDERS CHOOSE TO ATTACK: A DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL OF ROBBERIES IN CHICAGO
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense ? Do they rob close to home ? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets ? What keeps them away from certain areas ? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders.

TI  - WHAT MAKES LONG CRIME TRIPS WORTH UNDERTAKING? BALANCING COSTS AND BENEFITS IN BURGLARS' JOURNEY TO CRIME
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-to-crime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted.

TI  - Do juvenile, young adult, and adult offenders target different places in the Chinese context?
T2  - CITIES
AB  - Offenders' crime location choices have been a central theme of criminological research. However, little is known about the difference by offenders' age in their crime location choices. Based on the perspective of offender spatial decision-making, this study explores the variation in crime location choices committed by street robbers in different age groups, and examines how age-related activity nodes, journey to crime, and social disorganization influence street robbers' location choices in a large Chinese city. This study examines 7860 street robberies committed by 4358 street robbers between 2012 and 2016 in ZG city, China. A conditional logit selection model was estimated to assess street robbers' crime location choice preferences. The results demonstrate that street robbers favor areas frequented by their age group, close to their residence, and low in social cohesion. Cybercafe acute accent s affect juvenile and young adult robbers' crime location choices, while transportation hubs impact those of young adult robbers and adult robbers. Schools affect all three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. Besides, the distance of journey to crime plays a significantly negative role in an offender's target choice, with the greatest impact in the youngest age group. These findings add insight to the clarification of the difference by age in offenders' crime location choices.

TI  - Auto Theft and Restrictive Deterrence
T2  - JUSTICE QUARTERLY
AB  - Although researchers have examined the attributes that make offenders more or less responsive to sanction threats, far less attention has centered on the manner in which responsiveness can lead to less detectible crime, or perhaps even more overall crime. Restrictive deterrence is the concept that explains this paradox. We explore it here using qualitative interviews with 35 active auto thieves. Findings suggest that auto thieves' restrictively deterrent decision-making strategies fell into three broad categories: discretionary target selection, normalcy illusions, and defiance. Discussion focuses on the data's conceptual implications for restrictive deterrence and offender decision-making.

TI  - Offender Searches and Crime Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

TI  - Cleaning up your act: Forensic awareness as a detection avoidance strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: Although rational choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, there is a lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of "forensic awareness" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use.
   Methods: Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada.
   Results: Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness.
   Conclusion: Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene.

TI  - Expected utility, self-control, morality, and criminal probability
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - With data from random sample household surveys conducted simultaneously in major cities in Greece and in Russia, we evaluate the import of individuals' morality relative to expected utility and self-control in predicting criminal probability. In addition, we examine potential interactions among the three variables in predicting criminal propensity and compare their relative effects across the two samples. The results suggest that all three factors are important and mostly independent influences in explaining criminal probability. However, the estimated effects of morality are substantially stronger than those of either expected utility or self-control, and all three of these explanatory variables appear to be somewhat sensitive to cultural contexts. Overall, our findings confirm that morality plays a comparatively larger part in explaining conformity than is generally recognized by major contemporary theories, although the data cannot show whether morality is an element in rational decision making or represents a contrary "non-rational" element in accounting for human conduct.

TI  - Crime Feeds on Legal Activities: Daily Mobility Flows Help to Explain Thieves' Target Location Choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender's home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

TI  - Space-time dynamics of maritime piracy
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - The article examines space-time patterns of maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa. Using rational choice theory and optimal foraging theory as the theoretic frame, 6 years of recorded pirate attack data were used to test whether spatial and temporal attack patterns were independent. The results indicate evidence for a communicability of risk; that is, pirate activity clusters in space and time. Incorporating this finding means that forecasting of high-risk areas could be made more effective. The theoretical implication is that pirates' target selection appears to be consistent with other crime types, such as burglary, car crime and shootings. The results have implications for informing maritime piracy prevention and suppression efforts.

TI  - Lone Actor Terrorists: A Residence-to-Crime Approach
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Although there has recently been a considerable increase in research into lone actor terrorism, one of the main areas that remains understudied is that of target selection. The lack of empirically driven studies that can guide prevention measures is a notable oversight. This paper applies methods from environmental criminology to examine the residence-to-attack journeys of 122 lone terrorist acts in the U.S and Europe. The distance decay effect was evident, and significant differences were found between subgroups. Individuals were more likely to travel further if a) they were in the U.S, b) they had links to a wider network, c) they had a single-issue ideology, d) they attacked an iconic target, e) they attacked a symbolic building, or f) they used a bomb as their main weapon. A few case studies are discussed which highlight a need to conduct further research that considers the whole nodal network of an individual. The findings suggest that distance can be put forward as a constraining factor on lone actor target selection and provide support for the notion that the spatial decision making of terrorists is similar to traditional criminals.

TI  - Relationships Between Offenders' Crime Locations and Different Prior Activity Locations as Recorded in Police Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.

TI  - A Statistical Threat Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS
AB  - Criminal gangs, insurgent groups, and terror networks demonstrate observable preferences in selecting the sites where they commit their crimes. Accordingly, police departments, military organizations, and intelligence agencies seek to learn these preferences and identify locations with a high probability of experiencing the particular event of interest in the near future. Often, such agencies are keen not just to predict the spatial pattern of future events but even more importantly to conduct threat assessments of particular criminal gangs or insurgent groups. These threat assessments include identifying where each of the various groups presents the greatest threat to the community, what the most likely targets are for each criminal group, what makes one location more likely to experience an attack than another, and how to most efficiently allocate resources to address the specific threats to the community. Previous research has demonstrated that applying multivariate prediction models to relate features in an area to the occurrence of crimes offers an improvement in predictive performance over traditional methods of hot-spot analysis. This paper introduces the application of multilevel modeling to these multivariate spatial choice models, demonstrating that it is possible to significantly improve the predictive performance of the spatial choice models for individual groups and leverage that information to provide improved threat assessments of the criminal elements in a given geographic area.

TI  - A descriptive model of the hunting process of serial sex offenders: A rational choice perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE
AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed.

TI  - Sweeter than honey: Are Gmail accounts associated with greater rewards at a higher risk of hijacking?
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS
AB  - Objectives: This study investigates the effect of advertised rewards in credential leaks on the likelihood and speed of account hijacking. Methods: In an online field experiment, we created 176 honey Gmail accounts and randomly assigned them to eight different posts containing account credential leaks. We used a 2 x 2 experimental design, manipulating two key variables within the post titles: the number of accounts (5 K or 1.5 M) and the promise of access to additional platforms (absent or present). We then monitored the accounts for any subsequent activity. Results: Our findings indicate that the promise of access to additional platforms increased the likelihood and speed of an attempted access. Only 12 accounts were fully accessed, however, because most hijackers did not complete the second-factor authentication (2FA) process required for gaining full access. It seems that the 2FA acted as a deterrent to complete Gmail account hijacking. Conclusions: The study aligns with the rational choice perspective of crime, showing that the prospect of greater rewards leads to more attempted account accesses.

TI  - The Unusual Case of Sexual Homicide Against Males: Comparisons and Classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases-100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim's gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

TI  - The impact of emotion on offender decision-making: advancing our understanding through virtual re-enactment
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY CRIME & LAW
AB  - This article reviews approaches to the study of emotion in offender decision-making research. It then draws together theoretical models from psychology and neuroscience to propose an innovative method with which to move this field forward. Theories in this field have long called for a deeper understanding of the impact of emotion on criminal behaviour. While recent research has made some fruitful gains, it has been hampered by an overly narrow view of emotion and by limited methodologies. Using the expertise paradigm as an interdisciplinary and integrative framework, this article advocates incorporating into it established models of emotional experience from affective neuroscience to aid this endeavour. It further argues that employing the currently evolving virtual enactment method as a measurement tool will provide an unparalleled insight into the study of emotion as it unfolds during the offending act. Both environmental crime prevention and desistance from crime are likely to benefit considerably as a result.

TI  - Learning on the job: Studying expertise in residential burglars using virtual environments*
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - In this article, we describe a quasi-experiment in which experienced incarcerated burglars (n = 56), other offenders (n = 50), and nonoffenders (n = 55) undertook a mock burglary within a virtual neighborhood. We draw from the cognitive psychology literature on expertise and apply it to offending behavior, demonstrating synergy with rational choice perspectives, yet extending them in several respects. Our principal goal was to carry out the first robust test of expertise in offenders by having these groups undertake a burglary in a fully fledged reenactment of a crime in a virtual environment. Our findings indicate that the virtual environment successfully reinstated the context of the crime showing clear differences in the decision making of burglars compared with other groups in ways commensurate with expertise in other behavioral domains. Specifically, burglars scoped the neighborhood more thoroughly, spent more time in the high-value areas of the crime scene while traveling less distance there, and targeted different goods from the comparison groups. The level of detail in the data generated sheds new light on the cognitive processes and actions of burglars and how they "learn on the job." Implications for criminal decision-making perspectives and psychological theories of expertise are discussed.

TI  - Is There an "Expert" Stranger Rapist?
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - The concept of expertise applied to the criminal context assumes that offenders are driven by the abilities to both maximize the payoffs and minimize the risks associated with the crime-commission. This study tested the articulation between these two types of decisions taken by stranger rapists to successfully commit their crime. Specifically, this study aims to identify whether offenders whose modus operandi is indicative of criminal expertise are more likely to use forensic awareness strategies. Multivariate analyses conducted on 1,551 cases showed that stranger rapists who adopted behaviors indicative of expertise were more likely to use forensic awareness strategies to decrease the risk of police detection. Mixed associations were found between the number of forensic awareness strategies and their nature (i.e., protecting identity vs. destroying evidence) and rapists' expertise, thus leading to a four-type theoretical classification of expertise: novice, bold, opportunistic, and expert stranger rapists. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - Spatial patterns of serial murder: An analysis of disposal site location choice
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW
AB  - Although the murders committed by serial killers may not be considered rational, there is growing evidence that the locations in which they commit their crimes maybe guided by an implicit, if limited rationality.
   The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time.
   Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This article analyzes how street robbers decide on where to attack their victims. Using data on nearly 13,000 robberies, on the approximately 18,000 offenders involved in these robberies, and on the nearly 25,000 census blocks in the city of Chicago, we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers. We demonstrate that they attack near their own homes, on easily accessible blocks, where legal and illegal cash economies are present, and that these effects spill over to adjacent blocks.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Arson
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterning of arson incidents in a large urban county.
   Methods: Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space-time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy.
   Results: Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons.
   Conclusions: Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this invisible Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment. Results may aid in inductive theory building as well as efforts to investigate and prevent arson.

TI  - TARGET CHOICE DURING EXTREME EVENTS: A DISCRETE SPATIAL CHOICE MODEL OF THE 2011 LONDON RIOTS
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevailcrime pattern and social disorganization theoryand consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

TI  - Journey to Grow: Linking Process to Outcome in Target Site Selection for Cannabis Cultivation
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: To test whether there is a relationship between characteristics of the journey to an outdoor cannabis cultivation site and the total number of plants grown. Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: prime, rugged, dry, and remote. Prime sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying "prime" locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes.

TI  - DECISION MAKING IN THE CRIME COMMISSION PROCESS Comparing Rapists, Child Molesters, and Victim-Crossover Sex Offenders
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Based on a rational choice approach, this study compares the decision making involved in the crime commission process of rapists (n = 30), child molesters (n = 17), and victim-crossover sex offenders (n = 22). Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
CP  - 14th Annual Environmental Criminology and Crime Analysis Meeting
AB  - Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

TI  - A framework for estimating crime location choice based on awareness space
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders' previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders' knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location's crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies.

TI  - How do offenders choose where to offend? Perspectives from animal foraging
T2  - LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Purpose. Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example.
   Methods. Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour - central place foraging, Brownian walks and Levy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Levy walks, respectively.
   Results. Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Levy walks.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Levy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed.

TI  - Right place, right time? Making crime pattern theory time-specific
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - Objectives Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender's spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.

TI  - Where Do Dealers Solicit Customers and Sell Them Drugs? A Micro-Level Multiple Method Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - According to a rational choice theory of crime location choice, offenders commit crimes at locations where the mix of expected rewards and costs is optimal. The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crimeillicit drug dealing in an open air drug marketand tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for criminological theory and research methods.

TI  - An application of the rational choice approach to the offending process of sex offenders: A closer look at the decision-making
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Although the study of both offense processes and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender's decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as "irrational" and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders. Implications of the results are briefly discussed in regard of clinical practice and crime prevention.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: We explore negativism in the context of auto theft and examine its broader phenomenological significance for Rational Choice Theory. Methods: Data were drawn from qualitative, in-depth interviews with 35 active auto thieves operating out of a large Midwestern U.S. city. Results: Negativistic offending is malicious, spiteful, and/or destructive conduct whose purpose is typically more hedonic (i.e., short-term gratification) than instrumental (i.e., resource-generating) or normative (i.e., moralistic). It is made possible by the notion of ownership without responsibility: Offenders controlled a vehicle that was not theirs, promoting consequence irrelevance which in turn unleashed reckless conduct. Conclusions: Consequence irrelevance clarifies negativism's logic and permits linkage between affect-based and rational choice decision-making models.

TI  - Measuring the Impact of Negative Demand Shocks on Car Dealer Networks
T2  - MARKETING SCIENCE
AB  - The goal of this paper is to study the behavior of consumers, dealers, and manufacturers in the car sector and present an approach that can be used by managers and policy makers to investigate the impact of significant demand shocks on profits, prices, and dealer networks. More specifically, we investigate consumer demand, substitution patterns, and price decisions across different cars and dealer locations to identify dealerships with low margins or high fixed costs and measure the value of closing down dealerships for manufacturers. We apply our model empirically to the San Diego area using a transactional data set with information about the locations of dealers and consumers, as well as manufacturer and retail prices. We find strong consumer disutility for travel and find that dealers have local demand areas that are shared with a small set of competitors. We show that a reduction of market demand by 30% over two years, similar to the economic crisis of 2008-2009, results in an annual drop in prices of approximately 11%. We discuss this price drop in the context of the 2009 federal policy measure known as the Car Allowance Rebate System program. We compare predictions and actual dealership closings in the General Motors and Chrysler dealer networks as an application of our approach.

TI  - Do warnings deter rather than produce more sophisticated malingering?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Following Youngjohn, Lees-Haley, and Binder's (1999) comment on Johnson and Lesniak-Karpiak's (1997) study that warnings lead to more subtle malingering, researchers have sought to better understand warning effects. However, such studies have been largely atheoretical and may have confounded warning and coaching. This study examined the effect on malingering of a warning that was based on criminological-sociological concepts derived from the rational choice model of deterrence theory. A total of 78 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unwarned simulator group, or one of two warned simulator groups. The warning groups comprised low- and high-level conditions depending on warning intensity. Simulator participants received no coaching about how to fake tests. Outcome variables were scores derived from the Test of Memory Malingering and Wechsler Memory Scale-III. When the rate of malingering was compared across the four groups, a high-level warning effect was found such that warned participants were significantly less likely to exaggerate than unwarned simulators. In an exploratory follow-up analysis, the warned groups were divided into those who reported malingering and those who did not report malingering, and the performance of these groups was compared to that of unwarned simulators and controls. Using this approach, results showed that participants who were deterred from malingering by warning performed no worse than controls. However, on a small number of tests, self-reported malingerers in the low-level warning group appeared less impaired than unwarned simulators. This pattern was not observed in the high-level warning condition. Although cautious interpretation of findings is necessitated by the exploratory nature of some analyses, overall results suggest that using a carefully designed warning may be useful for reducing the rate of malingering. The combination of some noteworthy effect sizes, despite low power and the small size of some groups, suggests that further investigation of the effects of warnings needs to continue to determine their effect more fully.

TI  - Consistency and specificity in burglars who commit prolific residential burglary: Testing the core assumptions underpinning behavioural crime linkage
T2  - LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - PurposeBehavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders.
   MethodsUsing a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences.
   ResultsFindings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered - some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others.
   ConclusionsThe findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.

TI  - CRIME DIVERSITY
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Large geographic areas should host a greater diversity of crime compared with small geographic areas. This proposition is reasonable given that larger geographic areas should not only support more crime but also contain a greater diversity of criminogenic settings. This article uses a neutral model to characterize crime richness as a function of area. The model starts with two neutral assumptions: 1) that all environments are statistically equivalent and exert no influence on what types of crimes occur there; and 2) that different crime types occur independently of one another. The model produces rigorous predictions for the mean and variance in crime richness with increasing area. Tests of the model against a sample of 172,055 crimes occurring in Los Angeles during the year 2013 are qualitatively consistent with neutral expectations. The model is made quantitatively consistent by constant scaling. Resampling experiments show that at most 20 percent of the mean crime richness is attributable to nonrandom clustering and assortment of crime types. A modified neutral model allowing for variation crime concentration is consistent with observed variance in crime richness. The results suggest that very general and largely neutral laws may be driving crime diversity in space.

TI  - Outbound offending: The journey to crime and crime sprees
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Studies on crime and mobility primarily focus on local crime patterns. The city has long played an important role, whether analysing the offence or the offender. This paper goes beyond city boundaries and discusses 'outbound offenders', whose crime trips start in a city, but end outside. It is argued that a substantial proportion of crime trips follow this pattern, indicating that areas other than cities also provide interesting opportunities for property crime. We link outbound offending to a number of features that may explain crime travelling, including the target's features and offender/offence features. We find that outbound offending mostly occurs towards affluent target regions and near motorways, as such confirming findings from previous research. We also find crime sprees to be indicative for mobile offending. Thus, mobile property offenders tend to compensate for travelled distances, not only by targeting affluent areas and using fast transportation means, but also by committing several successive offences, hereby reducing their relative transportation cost for each offence.

TI  - Predicting Recidivism Among Released Juvenile Offenders in Florida: An Evaluation of the Residential Positive Achievement Change Tool
T2  - YOUTH VIOLENCE AND JUVENILE JUSTICE
AB  - Each year in the United States, as many as 100,000 juvenile offenders are released after completing a residential placement. A significant task for researchers is to identify the factors that explain variations in recidivism. This study considers this by evaluating the predictive validity of the Residential Positive Achievement Change Tool (R-PACT), a fourth-generation risk assessment instrument adopted by Florida for use in all of its juvenile residential facilities. The R-PACT includes a wide variety of static and dynamic risk and needs scales that are used here to predict reoffending among 4,700 released juvenile offenders in Florida. We devote special attention to (1) whether R-PACT scales typically predict reoffending and (2) whether the R-PACT's predictive validity varies across different subgroups of offenders. In considering these questions, we also consider whether the predictive risk and protective factors in prior research are predictive in the R-PACT as well. The analysis revealed relatively strong support for the R-PACT, but there were nuanced exceptions to that pattern. We discuss the implications these findings have for assessing risk, monitoring progress among residential youth, and predicting reoffending.

TI  - Consumer Choice and Use of Multiple Information Sources for Automobile Purchases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
AB  - People consult various sources, including the Internet, to search for information before purchasing an automobile. We develop an econometric model for a consumer's time allocation over multiple information sources. The process of searching is viewed as a formal choice problem in which the consumer attempts to choose the amount of search from multiple sources to maximize the benefit of purchase net of search cost. Observed data on time allocation over representative sources are postulated to arise from this optimizing behavior, and the proposed econometric model is calibrated to four waves of survey data from buyers of new automobiles, covering purchases made in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005. Consistent with the requirement that buyers must complete the transaction and obtain delivery at dealerships, we find that, on average, the baseline preference for sources is the highest for dealer-related activities. However, we also find that the share of time devoted to the Internet increases considerably with overall search time. In particular, we find that more educated buyers under age 40 who search extensively are likely to rely heavily on the Internet in their search. This indicates that the Internet has become the key medium for manufacturers and dealers who are targeting younger, more educated buyers.

TI  - Understanding Men's Perceptions of Risks and Rewards in a Date Rape Scenario
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed.

TI  - Distance decay reexamined
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - The "journey to crime," or the study of the distance between an offender's residence and offense site, has been a subject of study within criminology for many years. Implications arising from such research touches the majority of criminological theories. An overriding conclusion from this line of research is that most crimes occur in relatively close proximity to the home of the offender. Termed the distance-decay function, a plot of the number of crimes that an offender commits decreases with increasing distance from the offender's residence. In a recent paper, Van Koppen and De Keijser raise the concern that inferring individual distance decay, from aggregate-level data may be inappropriate. They assert that previous research reporting aggregated distance-decay functions conceals individual variations in the ranges of operation, which leads them to conclude that the distance-decay function is an artifact. We do not question the claim that researchers should not make inferences about individual behavior with data collected at the aggregate level. However, Van Koppen and De Keijser's analysis raises four important issues concerning (I) the interpretation of the ecological fallacy, (2) the assumption of linearity in offender movements, (3) the interpretation of geographic work on profiling and (4) the assumption of random target selection within a delimited range of operation. Using both simulated and nonsimulated data, we present evidence that reaches vastly different conclusions from those reached by Van Koppen and De Keijser. The theoretical implications of our analyses and possibilities for future research are addressed.

TI  - A step in time: A sequence analysis and choice modelling approach to examine time allocation in individual activities and the role of neighbourhood crime
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
AB  - The Space-Time Budget (STB) method is used to collect spatial and temporal features of an individual's activities and is an important technique to explore relationships between the environment and crime. This spatial and temporal approach to the study of everyday activity spaces reveals much about victimisation experiences, the relationship between place, time, and perceptions of safety, and where and when offending may occur. Few studies, however, consider the relationship between living in a criminogenic place (neighbourhood crime) and people's daily activity patterns. Drawing on disaggregate app-based data for 50 participants tracked over a 7-day period, we use sequence analysis to first delineate time allocation to each activity on a minute-by-minute basis. Next, using result from the sequence analysis we introduce the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to understand how neighbourhood crime and socio-demographic characteristics influence individuals' time allocation to discrete daily activities. Results reveal that neighbourhood drug and violent incidents exert restrictions on an individual's propensity to spend time outside the home. Females and older people appear more likely to be constrained by the presence of neighbourhood crime (in particular drug and property incidents) as they allocate less time to outdoor activities. The principal utility of the current study is its methodological advancement and the practical insights for urban planning regarding the design of crime prevention strategies to increase guardianship in public places.

TI  - Moving beyond the rational choice debate via social capital: The study of illegal private protection
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB  - In the context of the epistemological and methodological debates about rational choice (RC) sparked by Green and Shapiro and the subsequent rejoinders, Hindmoor made the theoretical claim that there is now an opportunity for RC to be enhanced and for past debates to be set aside by incorporating different theoretical perspectives into RC. This article presents an example of one context in which this can be done: the study of illegal private protection (IPP) produced by organised criminals and corrupt officials. It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC). Both positive and negative forms and effects of SC are considered. This approach highlights a middle ground between advocates and critics of RC, demonstrating a capacity to explain patterns in the production of IPP between organisations and across countries.

TI  - Myopic decision making: An examination of crime decisions and their outcomes in sexual crimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: According to the rational choice approach, offenders consider costs and benefits when making decisions. This study applies this framework to sexual offenses and examines how various decisions made by perpetrators of sexual crimes influenced the desired and undesired crime outcomes that resulted.
   Methods: The study examines 2296 crimes of a sexual nature committed by a sample of 898 offenders evaluated at the Massachusetts Treatment Center. Using Generalized Estimating Equations, 23 predictor variables measuring sexually coercive decisions made in each crime about four aspects (who?, when?, where?, and how?) are used to predict ten desired (positive) and seven undesired (negative) crime outcomes for offenders.
   Results: Results indicated that decisions made by offenders in the context of their sexual crimes were mostly oriented towards the production of immediate positive outcomes and the prevention of immediate negative outcomes, but demonstrated little consideration for non-immediate negative outcomes.
   Conclusions: Sexual offenders engage in myopic or hyperbolic discounting when making criminal decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of Varied Ambient Population Distribution on Spatial Pattern of Theft from the Person: The Perspective from Activity Space
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - The ambient population has been regarded as an important indicator for analyzing or predicting thefts. However, the literature has taken it as a homogenous group and seldom explored the varied impacts of different kinds of ambient populations on thefts. To fill this gap, supported by mobile phone trajectory data, this research investigated the relationship between ambient populations of different social groups and theft in a major city in China. With the control variables of motivated offenders and guardianship, spatial-lag negative binominal models were built to explore the effects of the ambient populations of different social groups on the distribution of theft. The results found that the influences of ambient populations of different social groups on the spatial distribution of theft are different. Accounting for the difference in the "risk-benefit" characteristics among different activity groups to the offenders, individuals from the migrant population are the most likely to be potential victims, followed by suburban and middle-income groups, while college, affluent, and affordable housing populations are the least likely. The local elderly population had no significant impact. This research has further enriched the studies of time geography and deepened routine activity theory. It suggests that the focus of crime prevention and control strategies developed by police departments should shift from the residential space to the activity space.

TI  - Crime displacement: what we know, what we don't know, and what it means for crime reduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - If offending were simply displaced following (often spatially) focused crime reduction initiatives, the continued expenditure of resources on this approach to crime reduction would be pointless. The aims of this article were to: critically appraise the current body of displacement research; identify gaps in understanding; articulate an agenda for future research; and to consider the implications of the accumulated findings for practitioners, evaluators, and policy makers.
   First, we review existing criminological theory regarding crime displacement and the alternative perspective-that crime prevention activity might generate a diffusion of crime control benefits. Second, we review the empirical research, focusing in particular on the findings of existing systematic reviews. Third, we consider the types of displacement that might occur and the methodological approaches employed to study them.
   Theoretical and empirical research suggests that displacement is far from inevitable and that a diffusion of crime control benefit is at least as likely. However, some forms of displacement have not been adequately studied.
   Existing research suggests that successful crime reduction interventions often have a positive impact on crime that extends beyond the direct recipients of a particular project. However, current understanding of crime displacement and how benefits might diffuse remains incomplete. Consequently, to inform an agenda for future research, we derive a typology of methodological issues associated with studying displacement, along with suggestions as to how they might be addressed.

TI  - Revisiting the generality of rational choice theory: Evidence for general patterns but differential effects across varying levels of psychopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Examining the role of individual differences in perceptions of risk and rewards to offending has become an important line of inquire (Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, & Madensen, 2006); however, psychopathy has yet to be considered. We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending.

TI  - A Socioeconomic Edge Effect: Rational Crime in Small Areas of Sharp Socioeconomic Contrast
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic "edges," as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study's findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an "edge" under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.

TI  - Learning the rational choice perspective: A reinforcement learning approach to simulating offender behaviours in criminological agent-based models
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Over the past 15 years, environmental criminologists have explored the application of agent-based models (ABMs) of crime events and various theoretical frameworks applied to understand them. Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort.

TI  - ON PLACE SAFETY
T2  - REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION
AB  - For a long time, social factors have been identified as a set of crucial determinants of residential location choice and property value. Here, safety and security issues constitute a significant issue. Inhabitants are traditionally concerned about their neighborhoods and housing locations, and, considering current problems in big Western cities, this concern is by no means lessening. The study presents a social innovation for assisting the search for safe housing environments. A list of quantifiable key features regarding negative externalities and actual criminality provides the basis for constructing a checklist for the comparison of safe places within a city, or comparing cities with respect to their safety for housing occupants, investors, developers and other stakeholders. The controversial nature of the argumentation notwithstanding, this method is suggested to prove valuable in circumstances marred by increasing social hazards and turmoil.

TI  - Minority threat, crime control, and police resource allocation in the Southwestern United States
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Numerous studies have examined political influences on communities' allocations of fiscal and personnel resources to policing. Rational choice theory maintains that these resources are distributed in accordance with the need for crime control, whereas conflict theory argues that they are allocated with the aim of controlling racial and ethnic minorities. Existing research more consistently supports the conflict argument, but important issues remain unaddressed. The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective. Class divisions within the Hispanic community may explain this pattern of findings.

TI  - Are Parrots CRAVED? An Analysis of Parrot Poaching in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available.".

TI  - "Drop the Body": Body Disposal Patterns in Sexual Homicide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - The current study investigates body disposal patterns in sexual homicide and examines whether offender's behavior differ between solved and unsolved cases. To address these two research questions in line with rational choice perspective, a series of logistic regression analyses was conducted on a sample of 250 solved, and 100 unsolved sexual homicide cases in Canada. Within solved cases, results show that if victim is a prostitute, body found concealed, and found lying face down, it is likely the body was moved. For unsolved cases, the role of victim as a prostitute, and body recovered outdoors suggest that the body was moved. Further, results indicate that post-crime phase factors predicted the most whether the victim's body was moved in solved cases. Whereas within unsolved cases, crime-phase factors contributed the most at predicting whether the body was moved post-homicide. Theoretical and practical implications from this study are discussed.

TI  - TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL POLICY IN THE ERA OF MASS ROBOTIZATION OF VEHICLES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF LAW
AB  - The problem of road safety and vehicle operation raises a number of complexities of a socioeconomic, administrative, and criminal nature. Therefore, the provisions considered in this article are mainly aimed at defining the problematic issues facing modern society in the era of active development of scientific and technological progress and ensuring transport security.
   The upcoming changes related to the mass introduction of driverless vehicles should already find options for the criminal law reaction of the legislator. However, until now, the scientific achievements under consideration are in the plane of the traditional understanding of the mechanism of criminal behavior. The threat of stage-by-stage robotization consists in the inevitable transformation of the existing foundations of public consciousness and the current legal system, which in the new conditions will become ineffective or even contradictory. It is completely justified to believe that to prevent such a development of events, a comprehensive analysis and legal assessment of the risks from the use of robotic cars is necessary, followed by the development of a unified concept of criminal policy, as well as proposals for improving the current legislation.
   The author refers to the main vectors of development of the criminal policy of the state:
   - expanding theoretical knowledge about the risks of using robotic vehicles;
   - obtaining new scientific data on the current state of road crime, socio-demographic and psychophysiological personality traits of the driver responsible for an accident.
   - obtaining new scientific data on the legal nature, mechanism of Commission and structure of road crime in the era of robotization, regularities of situational approach to the study of this problem.
   - theoretical justification of the modernization of domestic criminal legislation in the field of road safety, as well as modern approaches to preventive measures to prevent road crime.
   - development of new coping strategies as a means of self-control of the driver in stressful situations based on the discovery of new knowledge about the evolution of metacognitive patterns of the road criminal's personality and environmental influence on them.
   - development of a new methodology for professional driver training, along with the use of Informatization and technical control tools.
   - discovery of new ways to use the results of the research when developers create algorithms for the ethical choice model of robotic vehicles in provocative conditions.

TI  - Emergent Regularities of Interpersonal Victimization: An Agent-Based Investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization.
   Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness).
   Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime.
   Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

TI  - Mobilizing extremism: an examination of the travel patterns of right-wing extremists in the United States
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION
AB  - Extensive criminological research has documented a 'distance-decay' effect in criminal activity, with offenders less likely to commit crimes farther from their residences. While recent studies have identified similar patterns in ideologically motivated violence, variation in the travel behaviors of extremists remains underexplored. Using data on right-wing extremists who carried out a violent plot, between 2000 and 2020, alongside information on Capitol insurrectionist arrestees - and drawing on routine activity and rational-choice theories of offender decision-making - this study extends this literature along three dimensions: type, time, and ties. First, we distinguish between different types of offenders, showing that while both violent extremists and insurrectionists exhibit distance-decays, the latter tend to travel farther and exhibit a more irregular decay. Secondly, we identify a meaningful temporal shift in the right-wing extremist landscape, with offenders increasingly traveling longer distances to execute their plots. Finally, we highlight the role of social ties in shaping travel behaviors, where individuals affiliated with extremist groups tend to travel longer distances. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the spatial behavior of right-wing extremists, the factors influencing their mobility, and the evolving nature of right-wing extremism in the United States.

TI  - Differential Development of Perceived Costs and Rewards of Offending the Relevance for Predicting Offending in Early Adulthood: A Group-Based Trajectory Modeling Approach
T2  - VICTIMS & OFFENDERS
AB  - The present study sought to elucidate developmental patterns of perceived costs and rewards of offending and examine the relevance of this development for predicting offending in adulthood. The Pathways to Desistance data were used in analyses. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify latent patterns of development for both constructs. Negative binomial regression was used to test the relevance of differential development for predicting offending. A series of generalized estimation equations modeled age-graded changes in offending seriousness across the entire study period for each trajectory group identified in both models. Results indicated that a four-group model best fit the rewards data, while a three-group model best fit the costs data. Perceived rewards trajectory group membership significantly predicted offending in adulthood, with consistently elevated perception of rewards of offending found to be related to increased offending seriousness in adulthood. Differential development of perceived costs did not influence offending in adulthood. Consistently low and declining perceived rewards were associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to participants getting older. Increasing perceived costs of crime were similarly associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to age.

AB  - Border control is a crucial component of national security. For a country the size of the United States, however, the length of its land borders and coastlines poses a significant security challenge. Illegal migrant workers, drug couriers, foreign terrorists, smugglers, fugitives, and other criminals benefit from the geographic range and porous nature of American borders. The purpose of this research was to identify facilitating and inhibiting factors of illegal land border crossings in order to determine physical and human geographic features related to the probability of such movement. Identifying the geographic patterns of illegal migration can help the Border Patrol optimize resource allocation and anticipate offender reactions.

TI  - Development of juvenile delinquency - causes and conditions
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY-LAW-VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO
AB  - In the last few decades, juvenile delinquency in the Republic of Bulgaria has begun to acquire new and specific characteristics. Inexplicable cases of violence are all too common in schools, families and public places. The article analyzes a small part of the theories of juvenile delinquency that exist in the global aspect, which are based on the understanding that criminal acts are determined by mental and behavioral processes at the individual level. According to the theory of rational choice, minors are motivated offenders who subordinate their behavior to a certain goal. Another group of views is defined as theories of biological and psychological traits. Antisocial manifestations are not so much due to the course of certain motivational processes in an individual's mental state, but primarily to the formation of individual patterns of behavior. The article aims to assist Bulgarian criminal law and criminology in clarifying the current circumstances in which juvenile delinquency develops, and the conclusion is that they do not differ significantly from those in the global context. The different perspectives on juvenile delinquency and the interdisciplinary nature of the problems are presented as objectively as possible. Such an approach can lead to a rethinking of the mechanisms and measures that should be applied to achieve the educational purpose of punishment. The analysis presented in the article also supports the introduction of alternative measures to punishment, as well as the achievement of better results in terms of resocialization of juvenile offenders.

TI  - Criminals and the Price System: Evidence from Czech Metal Thieves
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper tests the economic theory of criminal behavior. Specifically, it looks at "the carrot" side of the theory, studying how thieves react to changes in monetary gains from crime.
   Using a unique crime-level dataset on metal theft in the Czech Republic, we study thieves' behavior in a simple regression framework. We argue that variation in metal prices represents a quasi-experimental variation in gains from crime. It is because (1) people steal copper and other nonferrous metals only to sell them to scrapyard and (2) prices at scrapyards are set by the world market. This facilitates causal interpretation of our regression estimates.
   We find that a 1% increase (decrease) in the re-sale price causes metal thefts to increase (decrease) by 1-1.5%. We show that the relationship between prices and thefts is very robust. Moreover, we find that thieves' responses to price shocks are rapid and consistent.
   Our results are in line with the economic model of crime, wherein criminal behavior is modeled as a rational agent's decision driven by the costs and benefits of undertaking criminal activities. Our estimates are also consistent with recent results from the United Kingdom, suggesting these patterns are more general.

AB  - Spatial analysis looks for statistically significant patterns in observed events that occur at specified locations. Most examples of spatial analysis consider aggregate characteristics over a number of coarsely defined regions rather than point processes. However, criminal events are point processes and should be modeled as such. In this paper, we combine recent advances in discrete choice theory and data mining to develop point process models for spatial analysis. We use this new methodology to analyze and predict the spatial behavior of criminals, and more generally, latent decision makers. The paper compares the performance of this methodology to more traditional hot spot methods of crime analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - This article makes use of hourly crime counts to model the relationship between events that take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and robberies, an arena that has caused local controversy regarding the costs and benefits of hosting such an entertainment venue. Results from the econometric model suggest that the NHL's New Jersey Devils ice hockey games, concerts, and Disney-themed events are all associated with increases in robbery, while various other event categories such as the NBA basketball games played by the Nets and boxing, and mixed martial arts (MMA) matches are not associated with an increase. These findings support two complementary ecological theories of crime that focus on how events provide additional opportunities for crime by increasing the associated benefits while simultaneously decreasing the cost for economically motivated offenders to take advantage of.

TI  - Crime in the breaking: Gender differences in desistance
T2  - LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW
CP  - 92nd Annual Meeting of the American-Sociological-Association
AB  - Despite increasing interest in understanding patterns of criminal behavior over the life course and, especially, desistance from crime, evidence about the predictors of these experiences has been derived only from samples of male offenders. We evaluate whether there are gender differences in the predictors of both self-reported illegal earnings and arrest among samples of recently released male and female offenders. Our analysis of gender differences illustrates how both the behavior of the offender and the behavior of law shape our understanding of the transition out of crime. We analyze event history data from a large-scale social experiment that provided employment to male and female offenders. The results indicate that (1) gender differences in the predictors of desistance largely depend on the domain of behavior under consideration; (2) indicators of normative status, as opposed to the perceived risks of crime or age-graded informal controls, are particularly important determinants of women's risks of rearrest.

TI  - GENERATIVE EXPLANATIONS OF CRIME: USING SIMULATION TO TEST CRIMINOLOGICAL THEORY
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

TI  - The Criminal Histories of Drug-Drive Offenders
T2  - POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This study examined the previous criminal behaviour of individuals who were arrested for violating the drug driving over the prescribed limit offence, introduced into the UK in March 2015. The sample consists of individuals arrested during the first year of enforcement of this offence from March 2015 to March 2016 within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Metropolitan Police Service in London. The previous criminal behaviour of the research subjects was framed within a number of criminological theories and there is examination of any correlation between their criminal history and the drug-driving offence they had been arrested for. The criminal activity was obtained from each individual's criminal record held on the police national computer and coded with regards to offence groups. As well as criminal sanctions, there was also an examination of drug-related arrest histories. The results indicate a high level of previous criminal activity with drugs and driving matters dominating that activity. This supports the construct that, in this context, drug driving fits within their patterns of offending.

TI  - Exploratory Space-Time Analysis of Burglary Patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper introduces two new methods for the exploratory analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of residential burglary patterns. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chain which considers the extent to which a location's probability of experiencing a residential burglary in a future period is related to the prevalence of residential burglaries in its surrounding neighborhood in an initial period. The second measure extends this conditional perspective to examine the joint evolution of residential burglary in a location and its surrounding neighborhood. These methods are applied to a case study of residential burglary patterns in Mesa, Arizona over the period October 2005 through December 2009. Strong patterns of spatial clustering of burglary activity are present in each year, and this clustering is found to have an important influence on both the conditional and joint evolution of burglary activity across space and time.

TI  - Does the Organized Sexual Murderer Better Delay and Avoid Detection?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - According to the organized-disorganized model, organized sexual murderers adopt specific behaviors during the commission of their crimes that contribute to avoiding police detection. The current study examines the effect of sexual murderers' organized behaviors on their ability to both delay and/or avoid police detection. Using a combination of negative binomial and logistic regression analyses on a sample of 350 sexual murder cases, findings showed that although both measures of delaying and avoiding detection are positively correlated, different behavioral patterns were observed. For instance, offenders who moved the victim's body were more likely to avoid detection but the victim's body was likely to be recovered faster. Moreover, victim characteristics have an impact on both measures; however, this effect disappears for the measure of delaying detection once the organized behaviors are introduced. Implications of the findings are discussed.

TI  - Getting a handle on crime: A further extension of routine activities theory
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. in addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness.

TI  - A National Examination of the Spatial Extent and Similarity of Offenders' Activity Spaces Using Police Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - It is well established that offenders' routine activity locations (nodes) shape their crime locations, but research examining the geography of offenders' routine activity spaces has to date largely been limited to a few core nodes such as homes and prior offense locations, and to small study areas. This paper explores the utility of police data to provide novel insights into the spatial extent of, and overlap between, individual offenders' activity spaces. It includes a wider set of activity nodes (including relatives' homes, schools, and non-crime incidents) and broadens the geographical scale to a national level, by comparison to previous studies. Using a police dataset including n = 60,229 burglary, robbery, and extra-familial sex offenders in New Zealand, a wide range of activity nodes were present for most burglary and robbery offenders, but fewer for sex offenders, reflecting sparser histories of police contact. In a novel test of the criminal profiling assumptions of homology and differentiation in a spatial context, we find that those who offend in nearby locations tend to share more activity space than those who offend further apart. However, in finding many offenders' activity spaces span wide geographic distances, we highlight challenges for crime location choice research and geographic profiling practice.

TI  - Carjacking: Scope, Structure, Process, and Prevention
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Carjacking is a violent crime with a broad motivational landscape related to the unique opportunities that a motor vehicle, as the item targeted, makes available to offenders once it is stolen. Although carjacking is technically a form of robbery, carjacking is a hybrid offense because it draws from elements of both regular robbery and motor vehicle theft. Nuanced in its etiology and expression, carjacking boasts a structure and process that require offenders to navigate multiple challenges under considerable time pressure and uncertainty. The fact that carjacking is so often opportunistic yet simultaneously requires a fair amount of calculation makes the offense even more subtle in its complexity. The purpose of this review is to examine these nuances through the lens of official data and existing empirical research. Nascent but growing, this research provides insight into the scope of the problem, the method and manner of the crime's commission, and the challenges of curbing a clear urban menace.

TI  - Power-seeking crime? The professional thief versus the professional launderer
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime.

TI  - REINTEGRATIVE POLICE SURVEILLANCE OF JUVENILE-OFFENDERS - FORGING AN URBAN MODEL
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - This article reviews patterns of police behavior vis-a-vis juvenile offenders and proposes a model called reintegrative surveillance, which is an integration of community-based corrections and community policing. Neither community-based corrections nor community policing is designed to handle serious, repeat offenders who are returning to high-crime neighborhoods. Police need to reexamine their roles to ensure that (a) policies of maintaining order and consequences of disorder are not ambiguous or misleading to youths and (b) order maintenance and law enforcement practices do not interfere with police ability to protect youths as victims of crime. Both tendencies are clearly widespread problems, and neither will be addressed as long as the ''worst'' neighborhoods and youths are considered beyond salvation. Correctional programs need to reevaluate police as a pivotal community resource. Reintegrative surveillance must include a gradational, consistent criminal justice response, protection, vigilance, interagency goal setting, and agency coordination.

TI  - Crime and conflict: Homicide in evolutionary psychological perspective
T2  - CRIME AND JUSTICE: A REVIEW OF JUSTICE
AB  - Criminological theories are usually framed in sociological terms but always entail psychological assumptions. Psychological accounts, in their turn, entail assumptions about the adaptive ''design'' of evolved mental mechanisms and processes. Thus, explicit attention to recent theory and research on psychology and evolution can sometimes help criminologists generate productive hypotheses and avoid blind alleys. Homicide research is illustrative. Interpersonal conflicts are engendered by interactions among individuals whose psyches were designed by natural and sexual selection to make them effective competitors and effective nepotists (kin-benefactors). These considerations suggest numerous testable hypotheses about such matters as who is likely to kill whom, and how the demography of homicide perpetration and victimization is likely to vary among victim-killer relationships. An evolutionary psychological perspective inspires us to criticize recent criminological discussions of sex differences and age patterns in criminal offending, theories that contrast rational choice with emotional or impulsive behavior, and the medicalization of antisocial behavior as a pathology.

TI  - EARNINGS PROSPECTS, MATCHING EFFECTS, AND THE DECISION TO TERMINATE A CRIMINAL CAREER
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study represents an effort to investigate the age pattern of criminal involvement from an economist's perspective. It presents a dynamic stochastic model of sequential search and match evaluation which is used to explain the reasons for, and the timing of, the decision to terminate a criminal career. The behavioral implications derived from the theoretical model are tested using individual National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Estimation results strongly support the prediction of a negative relation between the option value of retaining a criminal career and desistance decisions. More specifically, the effects of current and future expected criminal earnings are shown to be negative, substantial, and statistically significant in determining desistance probabilities. Retiring behavior is also significantly responsive to variables measuring personal costs of punishment and the availability and attractiveness of a legal income-generating activity in ways consistent with theoretical expectations.

TI  - Domestic and intimate violence: An application of routine activities theory
T2  - AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR
AB  - Much individual-level resenl ch in criminology is based on deterministic models of street-crime and suite-crime. Factors that constrain individuals to crime or conformity are predominant. This paper explores the advantages of a more soft determinism in explaining crime; especially intimate violence. Routine activities theory, which assumes freedom of action and rational choice, is used here to analyze patterns of intimate violence, especially, child sexual abuse. Marcus Felson's model of predatory crime provides a unique interpretation of intimate violence. Criminal incidents involve the physical convergence of three elements: a motivated offender; a suitable target; and the absence of a capable guardian. The convergence of these factors in intimate violence is analyzed; the potential of routine activity theory in explaining domestic abuse is assessed. Finally suggestions for crime control in intimate violence based on routine activities theory are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Criminal Contemplation, National Context, and Deterrence
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Using random samples of adults from three European countries rarely surveyed about crime-related issues, this study seeks to identify, with more extensive indicators than is typical, individuals who are likely to contemplate the commission of criminal acts. Then, it assesses the contextual universality of deterrence claims by estimating the deterrent effectiveness of perceived formal and informal sanctions for theft and violence among crime contemplators in Greece, Russia, and Ukraine. With criminal contemplation taken into account, our findings confirm the patterns established in past research. Whereas the threat of formal punishment shows little deterrent effect, perceptions of informal sanctions appear to influence projected crime. However, supportive findings hold only in Russia and Ukraine. Overall, it appears that the deterrent effectiveness of sanctions may be to some extent contingent on cultural or contextual characteristics.

TI  - Should We Stay or Should We Go? A Critical Review of Journey-to-Crime Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Our collective understanding of criminal mobility relies almost exclusively on journey-to-crime research, which focuses on the distances traveled by offenders from their homes to the location of their crimes. In this article, we ask whether the theoretical relevance and the methodological validity underlying the journey-to-crime measurement are sufficient for it to continue to be a leading influence in the field of environmental criminology. Based on a critical review of the foundations of journey-to-crime research, we argue that while the interest in the journey-to-crime measurement is understandable, there are better ways to assess criminal mobility. Some likely misleading implicit presuppositions and methodological biases are identified, and the manner in which they affect our comprehension of criminal mobility is discussed. We suggest that a better understanding of criminal mobility would come from complementing journey-to-crime with new and more refined measures. Implications for future studies are proposed.

TI  - A historical perspective on crime control and private security: a Belgian case study
T2  - POLICING & SOCIETY
AB  - Since the last decade of the twentieth century, several authors have claimed that the contemporary and 'new' developments in (private) policing and crime control form part of the process of neo-liberal policies and rational choice approaches to crime. However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned.

TI  - DETERRING CORPORATE CRIME
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Using event history analysis, we examine the recidivism patterns of a sample of 38 corporations charged with one or more serious antitrust violations between 1928 and 1981 to see whether sanction experience decreases the likelihood of a firm's reoffending. Specifically, we analyze the effects of procedure type (eg., civil, criminal and administrative redress) and proxy measures of corporate deterrence while controlling for changes in antitrust law and the economic conditions of the firm, industry, and general economy. Though not robust, there is some evidence that past guilty verdicts and changes in penalties for lawbreaking from misdemeanors to felonies inhibit recidivism. We note, however, that industry characteristics are stronger by far in their effects on future illegality than formal sanction risk or consequence. The implications of these findings for organizational deterrence and corporate crime control are discussed.

TI  - Measurement of Potential Victims of Burglary at the Mesoscale: Comparison of Census, Phone Users, and Social Media Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Since the target of burglars is generally the property of the inhabitant, it is crucial to accurately measure potential victims when analyzing burglaries, especially in small areas. Previous studies on burglary are mostly based on large units such as census tracts or communities. One of the difficulties is the measurement of the potential victims of burglary at the mesoscale. We compare the measuring effects of census population, census households, nighttime mobile phone users, and nighttime social media, such as the Tencent regional heatmap (TRH), on potential victims of burglary on 150 m x 150 m grids. Based on the rational choice theory, and controlling for the potentially confounding effects of risks and cost, we show that the TRH performed best, followed by census households and census population, and phone users performed poorly. The best-performing time period for TRH data was 3:00-5:00 am on weekends. These findings could lead to an improved measurement of potential victims of burglary at the mesoscale, and could provide scientific insight for crime prevention.

TI  - Violent Victimization Across the Life Course Moving a "Victim Careers" Agenda Forward
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - The present study examines violent victimization patterns across the life course and outlines a victim careers agenda for future scholarly inquiry. I analyzed four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine whether violent victimization prevalence, onset, and persistence during earlier stages of the life course can predict violent victimization risk in adulthood, and whether these relationships are observed independent of current violent offending. Violent victimization in adolescence was significantly related to subsequent risk in adulthood. Even when current violent offending is controlled, those who report early and persistent violent victimization during prior stages of the life course appear particularly vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The findings demonstrate the importance of moving forward with a victim careers agenda and the present study outlines numerous theoretical and empirical avenues for victimization scholars to pursue.

TI  - Hot or Cool Processing? Adolescent Decision-Making and Delinquency
T2  - JUSTICE QUARTERLY
AB  - Adolescence is a vulnerable period of individual development when decision-making is easily compromised, and criminal involvement reaches its peak. We draw on and extend novel decision-making perspectives and use the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 13,399) to analyze whether factors representing adverse physical conditions, negative mental states, and stressful social circumstances condition the effect of thoughtfully reflective decision-making (TRDM) on adolescent delinquent behavior. We find that experiencing various "hot triggers" such as sleep problems, depression, and straining conditions significantly reduces the crime-preventive impact of TRDM (an example of cool processing) among adolescents. We outline potential avenues for further theoretical development of integrated frameworks of decision-making and crime and discuss policy implications aimed at ways to deal with the adverse social, emotional, and physical triggers and foster thoughtful decision-making skills among adolescents.

TI  - A multilevel examination of the association between COVID-19 restrictions and residence-to-crime distance
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - Restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted people's daily routine activities. Rooted in crime pattern and routine activity theories, this study tests whether the enactment of a Safer-at-Home mandate was associated with changes in the distance between individuals' home addresses and the locations of where they committed crimes (i.e., residence-to-crime distance). Analyses are based on violent (N = 282), property (N = 1552), and disorder crimes (N = 1092) reported to one police department located in a United States' Midwest suburb. Multilevel models show that residence-to-crime distances were significantly shorter during the Safer-at-Home order, compared to the pre- and post-Safer-at-Home timeframes, while controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics. Additionally, these relationships varied by crime type. Consistent with the literature, the findings support the argument that individuals tend to offend relatively near their home address. The current findings extend the state of the literature by highlighting how disruptions to daily routine activities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic led to alterations in crime patterns, in which analyses indicated shorter distances between home address and offense locations.

T2  - CRIME AND JUSTICE: A REVIEW OF RESEARCH, VOL 25
AB  - Crime and legal work are not mutually exclusive choices but represent a continuum of legal and illegal income-generating activities. The links between crime and legal work involve trade-offs among crime returns, punishment costs, legal work opportunity costs, and tastes and preferences regarding both types of work. Rising crime rates in the 1980s in the face of rising incarceration rates suggest that the threat of punishment is not the dominant cost of crime. Crime rates are inversely related to expected legal wages, particularly among young males with limited job skills or prospects. Recent ethnographic research shows that involvement in illegal work often is motivated by low wages and harsh conditions in legal work. Many criminal offenders "double up" in both leg al work and crime, either concurrently or sequentially. This overlap suggests a fluid and dynamic interaction between legal and illegal work. Market wages and job opportunities interact with social and legal pressures to influence decisions to abandon crime for legal work. Explanations of the patterns of legal and illegal work should be informed by econometric, social structural, and labeling theories. The continuity of legal and illegal work, suggests the importance of illegal wages in research and theory on criminal decision making.

TI  - The impact of community residents' occupational structure on the spatial distribution of different types of crimes
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Spatial characteristics of community resident's occupational structure is a classic topic in social geography studies. However, it is still an under-explored topic to examine the impact of community residents' occupational structure on the spatial pattern of different types of crimes. Taking a large city in South China as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of different types of occupational residents on the crimes of burglary, pickpocketing and assault by establishing spatial lag negative binomial regression models. Our study shows that different occupational groups have different social characteristics and socioeconomic status, and so do their different impacts on various criminal activities. The specific conclusions are as follows: 1) the person in charge of the unit has no significant influence on these three types of crimes; 2) professional skill workers have a significant positive impact on pickpocketing and assault; 3) clerks, business and service people and primary industry personnel have significant positive impacts on burglary; and 4) the distribution of personnel in the primary industry nearby will inhibit burglary, pickpocketing and assault. This study further explained the results in combination with the 'costs, benefits and risks' of rational choice theory. The conclusions may be of great reference value for community police strategies.

TI  - Examining the role of differential association and techniques of neutralization in explaining corporate crime
T2  - DEVIANT BEHAVIOR
AB  - A limited number of studies have examined white-collar offending decision making patterns and virtually none have focused on testing Differential Association or Techniques of Neutralization theory in particular. This study evaluates the offending decisions of MBA students to commit corporate offending in the promotion/sales of a hypothetical pharmaceutical drug. The sample consisted of 133 MBA students enrolled at a university in the United States. Findings supported predictions that anticipated agreement of coworkers and the board of directors would be positively associated with decisions to further market an produce a hypothetical drug that was about to be recalled by the Food and Drug Administration. However, results also showed that the decision to commit corporate crime was inversely related to perceptions that close friends and business professors agree with the decision, which went against predictions based on differential association theory. Several neutralizing techniques-especially the beliefs that government exaggerates dangers to the consumer and profit is the most important priority-predicted the decision to further market the drug. Subsequent analyses showed that older respondents were more likely to employ techniques of neutralization in decisions to commit corporate crime, especially techniques relating to profits. Future research directions are outlined.

TI  - The CIA made me do it: understanding the political economy of corruption in Kazakhstan
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the U. S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

TI  - Perceived deterrence and outcomes in drug court
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW
CP  - Annual Conference of the American-Psychology-and-Law-Society
AB  - According to perceived-deterrence theory, the likelihood that an offender will engage in drug use or illegal activity is influenced by the perceived certainty of being detected for infractions or recognized for accomplishments, the perceived certainty of receiving sanctions for infractions or rewards for accomplishments, and the anticipated magnitude of the sanctions and rewards. This study evaluated drug court participants' perceived deterrence at monthly intervals during their enrollment in drug court. Exploratory cluster analysis (N = 255) on the longitudinal scores yielded five subtypes of drug offenders characterized either by consistently elevated perceived-deterrence scores, consistently moderate scores, consistently low scores, increasing scores, or decreasing scores. The best outcomes were associated with consistently elevated scores, whereas the worst outcomes were associated with scores that declined over time as the participants became accustomed to the program. The clusters also differed in predicted directions on demographic variables. The correlational design does not permit inferences of causality; however, the results lend credence to perceived deterrence as a potential explanatory mechanism for the effects of drug courts.

TI  - Underused potentials for criminology: Applying the sociology of knowledge to terrorism
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
CP  - 57th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Criminology
AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world.

TI  - When failure is the option: Unravelling sexual assault outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - We investigate the concept of "criminal failure" in sexual crimes and the relevance of various theoretical frameworks for its understanding: individual offender's rational choice, environmental influences and routine activities, victimological characteristics from lifestyle theory, and crime interaction factors. We examined a sample of 1121 "failed" cases (i.e., attempted but not completed) and 1500 "successful" cases (i.e., completed) of sexual assault that occurred in France between 1990 and 2018. We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime. This understudied area can yield important theoretical knowledge and practical implications regarding the prevention of sexual crimes.

TI  - 'Two Sides of the Same Coin'-A Proposed Model for Delivering a Whole System Serial Crime Reduction Plan
T2  - POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender-Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.

TI  - Super controllers and crime prevention: A routine activity explanation of crime prevention success and failure
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
CP  - 17th Annual Environmental Criminology and Crime Analysis Symposium
AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers' incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods.

TI  - Enacting social engineering: the emotional experience of information security deception
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Social engineering is a modern form of fraud that is widely implicated in contributing to information security breaches. This study situates social engineering in past criminological work on fraud and analyzes qualitative interviews with social engineers to elucidate the emotional experiences of perpetrating such frauds. The results of this analysis indicate that social engineering interactions are characterized by an emotional experience of situational tension and the subsequent resolution of that tension. The analysis then turns to factors that modulate the quality and intensity of the emotional experience of social engineering perpetration. These factors include the social distance between the social engineer and the mark, the social engineer's framing the mark, and both perceived and actual efficacy in utilizing skills involved in management of self and situation. This study suggests that the emotional experience of social engineering parallels that of other frauds and is revelatory of the motivations behind the experiences.

T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - ObjectivesTo examine the perceptual deterrent effect of an increase in police presence for a sample of previously adjudicated adolescents and address the limitations of existing perceptual deterrence research.MethodsThis study exploits the timing of Operation Safe Streets, a hot spots policing intervention designed to increase officer presence, which occurred during an ongoing longitudinal survey of previously adjudicated adolescents (n = 700). The effect of this intervention is tested using first-difference models of perceptions of arrest risk within-person over time. Sensitivity analyses and falsification tests are also conducted to provide further confidence in the findings.ResultsResults show that Operation Safe Streets is related to an increase in perceptions of arrest risk for one's self, as well as perceptions of other's arrest risk. This pattern holds for those who were and were not arrested. Furthermore, null findings for the effect of Operation Safe Streets on perceived social costs of punishment, as well as null findings from in-time placebo models, lend strong support that an increase in police officer presence did increase individuals' perceptions of arrest risk in the months following the intervention.ConclusionsThis study is the first to test the perceptual deterrent effect of a police intervention aimed to reduce street crime. It is also one of the first to demonstrate that criminal justice policies impact perceptions of arrest risk. This study adds to our understanding of the success of hot spots policing by suggesting that one pathway for decreased crime is through changes in perceptions of arrest risk.

TI  - The Psycho-criminology of Burial Sites: Developing the Winthropping Method for Locating Clandestine Burial Sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The majority of geographical profiling research focuses on the relationship between offender and location, which works particularly well when a burial site is known. In real-world investigations, however, burial or dump sites are often not known. The aim of the current paper is to outline a relatively under-used method of geographic profiling: Winthropping. While the method has been around for several decades, few studies have provided any research findings using it. There are two likely reasons for Winthropping being under-used: first, it has not been clearly, theoretically explained; second, given its relative novelty, it may not be immediately clear how to use it in research and real-world scenarios. The current paper outlines several key psychological (e.g., satisficing and affordances) and criminological (e.g., rational choice theory and crime geometry) theories that may explain why Winthropping works. Case studies are provided, and a methodological approach (matrix forecasting) is then provided to show how it could work in research practice and real-world applications. Overall, Winthropping is deemed to be highly useful, and it is hoped that experts in the field will begin developing this tool for wider, applied use.

TI  - Sexual crime and place: The impact of the environmental context on sexual assault outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: Using the rational choice perspective, the current study investigates the impact that the environment and offending behavior have on serial sexual crime event outcomes.
   Methods: The effects of time and place factors, as well as offender modus operandi strategies, on sexual crime event outcomes are tested using Generalized Estimating Equations on a sample of 361 crime events committed by 72 serial sex offenders.
   Results: Time and place do impact serial stranger sexual offenders' modus operandi strategies, but the place characteristics of the crime have more of an effect on the offender's behavior than do the temporal conditions during which the event occurs. Subsequent analyses indicate that temporal and place factors, as well as offender modus operandi strategies, predict whether the offender completes the rape, his reaction to victim resistance, and the level of physical force that he inflicts on the victim, but not whether the victim is forced to commit sexual acts on the offender.
   Conclusions: Serial stranger sexual offenders are effective decision-makers who adapt their strategies to the physical environment in which they commit their crimes, but their degree of rationality can vary as some outcomes are more dependent on the context than the offender and his actions.

TI  - Criminal clickbait: a panel data analysis on the attractiveness of online advertisements offering stolen data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
AB  - IntroductionFew studies have examined the sales of stolen account credentials on darkweb markets. In this study, we tested how advertisement characteristics affect the popularity of illicit online advertisements offering account credentials. Unlike previous criminological research, we take a novel approach by assessing the applicability of knowledge on regular consumer behaviours instead of theories explaining offender behaviour.MethodsWe scraped 1,565 unique advertisements offering credentials on a darkweb market. We used this panel data set to predict the simultaneous effects of the asking price, endorsement cues and title elements on advertisement popularity by estimating several hybrid panel data models.ResultsMost of our findings disconfirm our hypotheses. Asking price did not affect advertisement popularity. Endorsement cues, including vendor reputation and cumulative sales and views, had mixed and negative relationships, respectively, with advertisement popularity.DiscussionOur results might suggest that account credentials are not simply regular products, but high-risk commodities that, paradoxically, become less attractive as they gain popularity. This study highlights the necessity of a deeper understanding of illicit online market dynamics to improve theories on illicit consumer behaviours and assist cybersecurity experts in disrupting criminal business models more effectively. We propose several avenues for future experimental research to gain further insights into these illicit processes.

TI  - Crime prevention of bus pickpocketing in Beijing, China: does air quality affect crime?
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - In recent years, along with the development of the urban public transport system, bus pickpocketing crimes have garnered increasing attention. In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes.

TI  - Diversity in organised crime
T2  - REVIJA ZA KRIMINALISTIKO IN KRIMINOLOGIJO
AB  - Authors dealing with organised crime have in recent times usually stressed a similarity between the activities of organised criminal associations and the operation of legal companies, and highlight their rationality. Given a choice between legal and illegal activities, illegal entrepreneurs make a selective rational choice, based on a calculation of what is better for them and for their companies, claim advocates of the theory of criminal enterprise. Their choices and patterns - as in companies which function within the law - follow the general economic principle of making a profit on profitable markets. Authors therefore focus on the organisation of criminal activity and on the illegal market dynamics and not on the individuals involved in these activities. With an understanding of organised criminal associations as criminal enterprises, these author deviate from Gottfredson's and Hirschi's idea, according to which individuals involved in organised crime typically have a low degree of self-control, i.e., are impulsive; short-sighted and oriented to the present moment, inclined to the instant satisfaction of desires and unwilling to work for remote aims. Are individuals and the activity of members of criminal groups, which are needed for organised crime really so uniform? An analysis of the literature, the carrying out of an (ethnographic) research project in the field of organised crime and interviews conducted for this purpose confirm that criminal offenders do not exist in a social and physical world which is different from other parts of society. Since organised crime is a part of the diversity of the everyday world, due to its nature it attracts or needs a very diverse group of activities and people.

T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - A number of studies have revealed a correlation between bus stops and crimes, especially street robberies. However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement.

TI  - Street Light Outages, Public Safety and Crime Attraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives For more than one hundred years, street lighting has been one of the most ubiquitous capital investments in public safety. Prior research on street lighting is largely limited to ecological studies of very small geographic areas, creating substantial challenges with respect to both causal identification and statistical power. We address limitations of the prior literature by studying a natural experiment created by short-term disruptions to municipal street lighting. Methods We leverage a natural experiment created by the differential timing of the repair of nearly 300,000 street light outages in Chicago. By conditioning on street segment fixed effects and focusing on a short window of time around the repair of a street light outage, we can credibly rule out confounding factors due to area-specific time trends as well as street segment-level correlates of crime. Results We find that outdoor nighttime crimes change very little on street segments affected by street light outages, but that outages cause crime to spill over to nearby street segments. Effects are largest for robberies and motor vehicle theft. Conclusions Despite strong environmental and social characteristics that tend to tie crime to place, we observe that street light outages are sufficiently salient to disrupt longstanding patterns. While the impact of localized street light outages can reverberate throughout a community, the findings imply that improvements in lighting can be defeated by the displacement of crime to adjacent spaces and therefore do not necessarily suggest that localized investments in municipal street lighting will yield a large public safety dividend.

TI  - Geocoding child sexual abuse: An explorative analysis on journey to crime and to victimization from French police data
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB  - Background: For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geo-graphical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns.
   Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013.
   Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern.
   Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces.
   Conclusions: Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between income inequality and crime in Toronto using frequentist and Bayesian models: Examining different crime types and spatial scales
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
AB  - Income inequality, which refers to the uneven distribution of income in a population, has been linked to many societal problems, including crime. Although environmental criminology theories, such as rational choice theory, suggest a positive association between income inequality and crime, previous empirical studies have reported divergent results based on different crime types, statistical models, and spatial units of analysis. This study employs non-spatial and spatial regression models using frequentist and Bayesian modelling frameworks to explore the impacts of within-area and across-area income inequality on five types of major crimes in the City of Toronto at the census tract and dissemination area scales. The use of spatial regression models improves the model fit in both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The Bayesian shared component model, which accounts for the interactions between different types of crimes, further enhances model performance. Results obtained from the best-fitting frequentist and Bayesian models are inconsistent but do not conflict in terms of the relationship between crime and income inequality, where within-area income inequality generally increases major crime rates, while across-area income inequality has varying effects dependent on crime type and spatial scale. The discrepancies between spatial scales are a manifestation of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP).

TI  - A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY TO CRIME: EFFECTS OF RESIDENTIAL HISTORY ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE*
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes. Building on crime pattern theory and combining information from police records and other sources, this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in. In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago. The theoretical implications of these findings and their use for investigative purposes are discussed, and suggestions for future inquiry are made.

TI  - Predictive policing in hospitality and tourism venues - The case of Orlando
T2  - JOURNAL OF DESTINATION MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public.

TI  - The Impact of Online and Offline Information Sources on Automobile Choice Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB  - The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Simulating Spatial-Temporal Pulse Events in Criminal Site Selection Problems
T2  - AGENT-DIRECTED SIMULATION SYMPOSIUM 2012 (ADS 2012)
CP  - Agent-Directed Simulation Symposium (ADS 2012)
AB  - Previous academic research has identified the correlation between special events and crime rates within cities. However, in much of the previous work, the focus was either on spatial or temporal analysis related to the evolution of local crime patterns in conjunction with the special events. This research uses a hybrid agent-based simulation to examine the impact of temporal pulse events on the criminal site selection process. The simulation provides researchers with a method for adjusting both the temporal and spatial patterns in response to a series of a-priori cultural events. Using the data from this simulation, we illustrate the effectiveness of a new modeling approach. Initial results show that adding a hierarchical framework to a generalized linear model improves crime prediction accuracy and offers the law enforcement analyst better insight into both the temporal and spatial considerations of criminals. Improving the ability of law enforcement to identify, and prepare for, spatial-temporal shifts in crime patterns will significantly enhance proactive policing operations and resource allocation planning in support of large special events.

TI  - The Incidence and Characteristics of UK Stranger Sex Offenses Fluctuated With Public Health Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF VIOLENCE
AB  - Objective: With COVID-19 came a range of public health measures that impacted people's routine activities. According to routine activity theory, these could affect the rate and nature of crime. This has largely been examined with volume crime (e.g., burglary, robbery) or crimes committed in the home. Stranger sex offenses greatly vary in nature and occur in a range of settings; therefore, these offenses present a novel opportunity to investigate different routine activity theory-based hypotheses. Method: The National Crime Agency routinely collects detailed information about all stranger sex offenses reported to the police in the United Kingdom. With these standardized data (N = 6,422), we studied the relationship between COVID-19 public health measures and the rate and characteristics of stranger sex offending across the entire first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasting this with data from the same period pre-COVID-19. Results: Our findings accord with classic criminological theory whereby the incidence and characteristics of U.K. stranger sex offenses reported to police covaried with the population's patterns of mobility and national lockdowns during the first year of COVID-19. This impact on routine activities also manifested in differences in perpetrator and victim behavior and characteristics. Conclusions: Our study supports the applicability of routine activity theory to sex offending and brings new insights regarding the situational prevention of sex offending during major events such as a pandemic. It is also relevant to the urgent need to educate prosecutors who are now making decisions about sex offenses perpetrated during the early years of this pandemic.

TI  - Testing Indicators of Risk Populations for Theft from the Person across Space and Time: The Significance of Mobility and Outdoor Activity
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - In recent years, it has increasingly been recognized that due to the uncertain geographic context problem caused by daily human mobility, the residential population is too static to serve as a valid measure of the population at risk for criminal victimization. Various alternative measures have been suggested instead. Guided by the routine activity approach, this study furthers the concept of crime risk population and its measurement across space and time. Using exceptionally comprehensive data sets on population mobility and on theft from the person in a large city in China, we select the best indicator of the risk population from the following four candidates: residential population, subway ridership, taxi ridership, and mobile phone users. Controlling for the potentially confounding effects of offender and guardian presence, we show that on both weekdays and weekends, the best indicators of risk population vary over the course of the day. In the morning, residential population outperforms other measures. In the afternoon and evening, taxi ridership and phone users are better indicators. Although the mobile phone user base forms an arguably more representative measure of ambient population, during some periods taxi ridership is superior because it provides a better indicator of outdoor (as opposed to indoor) activities. In terms of practical applications to security policy and law enforcement, these findings can help identify crime hot spots by calculating accurate crime risks.

TI  - The effect of a reduction in heroin supply in Australia upon drug distribution and acquisitive crime
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - In early 2001, Australia experienced a sudden, significant reduction in the availability of heroin, following a number of years of unprecedented availability of high-grade heroin. This study examines changes in the scale, method, structure and visibility of heroin and other drug distribution in New South Wales (NSW), and in the incidence of possession and use of heroin and other drugs associated with this reduction in heroin availability. Police incident data on possession/use of illicit drugs and on incidents of acquisitive crime were analysed using time-series analysis. Key informants (n=71) from NSW law enforcement and health agencies and heroin users (n=53) were interviewed regarding changes in the drug market following the reduced availability of heroin. NSW police reports were accessed for information on police investigations into drug crime and related activities. Drug distribution in NSW appeared to change around the time of the heroin shortage. High-level distribution of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine may have remained somewhat discretely managed by different organized crime groups but greater collaboration occurred between these groups. Among mid-level distributors, there appeared to be a shift in emphasis from heroin to other drug distribution. Low-level dealers may have made a short-term shift from heroin to cocaine distribution. Low-level drug dealing also appeared to shift towards mobile and less overt methods of dealing. The number of street-level dealers reduced and in the longer-term, visibility of the drug markets decreased. There were significant decreases in police incidents of heroin possession/use reported by police, which were more marked among males and younger persons. At the same time, increases were observed in incidents for cocaine possession/use. There was a sustained decrease in theft offences but a temporary increase in robbery offences during the peak period of reduced availability. This appeared to represent a shift in the criminal behaviour of users remaining in the market and was associated with changes in drug-use patterns. Although the motivation behind the offending behaviour remained the same over time, cocaine use was associated with more violent crime. The method and structure of illicit drug distribution changed along with reduced heroin supply and carried implications for the policing of drug markets. Australia does not have a large cocaine market and the findings may have differed in countries where cocaine is in more ready supply.

TI  - CARESim: An integrated agent-based simulation environment for crime and risk evaluation (CARE)
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - It requires innovations to accurately predict crimes and offending risks due to the complex nature of human behaviors within different social contexts. In recent years, theory-based and data-driven agent-based models have become useful tools in computational criminology with the abundance of public data, the rise of computing powers, and extensive explorations of related theories and modeling tools. In this paper, we present CARESim, an integrated simulation environment to predict the risks of high-risk individuals committing street violent crimes. The simulation environment combines agent-based modeling with a real geographical information system and incorporates public data (e.g., environmental data, crime data, census data, and transportation data) to repro-duce authentic human mobility. This simulation environment is capable of replicating crime patterns and evaluating policies. We demonstrate the use of this environment and illustrate how key factors, such as social networks, the neighborhood, the weather, police patrol strategies, the population, and citizens' behaviors, impact the risk of street-level violent offending. Furthermore, the environment can support the optimization of patrol strategies and offer evaluations of different social setups that could be unfeasible or expensive to test in real life.

TI  - Locating offenders: Introducing the reverse spatial patterning approach
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Objectives: Current strategies for locating where offenders live either focus exclusively on individual suspects or generalize to entire neighborhoods. However, better estimates of where offenders are located may improve models of the ecological distribution of crime, and forecasts of the locations of future crime incidents.Methods: We propose a novel reverse spatial patterning (RSP) strategy that estimates where offenders may live based on the spatial locations of crime events. We rely on a distance decay function - based on the consistent finding that offenders do not travel far to commit crime - and Hipp's specialIntscript general theory of spatial crime patterns, to work backwards from the locations of actual crime events to make predictions about where offenders may live in subsequent years. We then use these estimates in models predicting crime locations. We create two versions of the RSP: one which assumes everyone is equally likely to offend, and another that creates an estimate assuming disproportionate offending across persons.Results: We test the effectiveness of our proposed strategy for these two measures using offense and arrest data from St. Petersburg, FL, and assess how well they predict the location of offenders (proxied by arrestees) and future crime events. We find consistent evidence that our RSP strategy provides better predictions of the loca-tions of where offenders are located and also future crime incidents across a variety of crime types compared to existing strategies.Conclusion: The RSP approach is useful for creating estimates of where offenders live, which allow for better predictions of the locations of future crime incidents. These better forecasts will allow for more efficient allo-cation of police resources and targeted crime suppression efforts.

TI  - Investigating Factors Related to Criminal Trips of Residential Burglars Using Spatial Interaction Modeling
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - This study used spatial interaction modeling to examine whether origin-specific and destination-specific factors, distance decay effects, and spatial structures explain the criminal trips of residential burglars. In total, 4041 criminal trips committed by 892 individual offenders who lived and committed residential burglary in Tokyo were analyzed. Each criminal trip was allocated to an origin-destination pair created from the combination of potential departure and arrival zones. The following explanatory variables were created from an external dataset and used: residential population, density of residential burglaries, and mobility patterns of the general population. The origin-specific factors served as indices of not only the production of criminal trips, but also the opportunity to commit crimes in the origin zones. Moreover, the criminal trips were related to the mobility patterns of the general population representing daily leisure (noncriminal) trips, and relatively large origin- and destination-based spatial spillover effects were estimated. It was shown that considering not only destination-specific but also origin-specific factors, spatial structures are important for investigating the criminal trips of residential burglars. The current findings could be applicable to future research on geographical profiling by incorporating neighborhood-level factors into existing models.

TI  - A data-driven agent-based simulation to predict crime patterns in an urban environment
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Spatial crime simulations contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive crime and can support decision-makers in developing effective crime reduction strategies. Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction.

TI  - Identifying roles in drug trafficking using geolocation from telephone data collected during investigations
T2  - CRIMINOLOGIE
AB  - Communication surveillance, one of the main tools used in investigations of drug trafficking, is used to reconstruct criminal activity, identify the offenders, determine their respective roles within the trafficking operation, and eventually locate them. Research into the use of telephone data to study criminal groups currently relies mainly on transcripts of phone conversations obtained through police wiretapping. Our exploratory research also benefited from privileged access to telephone data from wiretaps and records of call details collected both in real time and retrospectively during investigations. Our research focuses on the relation between the roles of individuals involved in drug trafficking and the spatial patterns detected in telephone communications. We asked whether the role of a protagonist - his/her function and place within a trafficking group - can be inferred from telephone activities and addressed this question through a spatiotemporal analysis of call detail records and wiretaps from 20 individuals implicated in drug trafficking. The selected individuals could be classified into three different roles : dealer, mid-level or high-level wholesaler, and cross-border or national courier. To determine their mobility, median locations, convex-hull areas, and the average distance travelled per day were calculated for each individual and by role type. The results support the hypothesis that individual roles influence the patterns found in telephone data. Couriers can be differentiated from dealers and wholesalers based on identifiable geographic patterns. Dealers can also be distinguished from wholesalers. These results confirm the proposed approach and reveal the potential of the analysis of telephone data to infer roles in drug trafficking.

TI  - The Moving Home Effect: A Quasi Experiment Assessing Effect of Home Location on the Offence Location
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives This study aims to test whether the home location has a causal effect on the crime location. To accomplish this the study capitalizes on the natural experiment that occurs when offender's move, and uses a unique metric, the distance between sequential offenses, to determine if when an offender moves the offense location changes.
   Methods Using a sample of over 40,000 custodial arrests from Syracuse, NY between 2003 and 2008, this quasi-experimental design uses t test's of mean differences, and fixed effects regression modeling to determine if moving has a significant effect on the distance between sequential offenses.
   Results This study finds that when offenders move they tend to commit crimes in locations farther away from past offences than would be expected without moving. The effect is rather small though, both in absolute terms (an elasticity coefficient of 0.02), and in relation to the effect of other independent variables (such as the time in between offenses).
   Conclusions This finding suggests that the home has an impact on where an offender will choose to commit a crime, independent of offence, neighborhood, or offender characteristics. The effect is small though, suggesting other factors may play a larger role in influencing where offenders choose to commit crime.

TI  - Spatio-temporal interaction of urban crime
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Over the past decade, a renewed interest in the analysis of crime hot-spots has emerged in the social and behavioral sciences. Spurred by improvements in computing power, data visualization and geographic information systems, numerous innovative approaches have materialized for identifying areas of elevated crime in urban environments. Unfortunately, many hot-spot analysis techniques treat the spatial and temporal aspects of crime as distinct entities, thus ignoring the necessary interaction of space and time to produce criminal opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the utility of statistical measures for identifying and comparing the spatio-temporal footprints of robbery, burglary and assault. Functional and visual comparisons for spatio-temporal clusters are analyzed across a range of space-time values using a comprehensive database of crime events for Cincinnati, Ohio. Empirical results suggest that robbery, burglary and assault have dramatically different spatio-temporal signatures.

TI  - Neighborhood effects and consequences of criminal justice contact: a research framework
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL URBAN SCIENCE
AB  - This paper proposes a framework to examine how neighborhood factors influence criminal justice (CJ) contact and contribute to disparities across multiple stages of the justice process. By conceptualizing the punishment process as a dynamic set of decision-making points, this study highlights the role of neighborhood context in shaping offenders' CJ trajectories and post-CJ residential inequality. Using Harris County, Texas, as a case study, this research considers individual-, neighborhood-, and event-level variables to understand the cumulative effects of neighborhood characteristics on CJ outcomes. This study underscores the critical need to investigate neighborhood mobility and its broader implications for community development and public policy. The findings can be supported by extensive data from the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers and the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System, offering a robust analysis of offenders' spatial patterns and economic transitions.

TI  - From mobility to crime: Collective patterns of human mobility and gun violence in Baltimore City
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: In this research, I investigated the link between collective mobility patterns-specifically inward population flow and residential mobility-and changes in reported gun violence incidents in Baltimore City. I also examined whether this relationship differs among various types of gun violence. Furthermore, I explored the potential moderating influence of collective mobility patterns on the relationship between neighborhood hotspot coverage and occurrences of gun violence. Methods: The data were sourced from a blend of mobile device location data, Part 1 crime data from the Baltimore Police Department, the American Community Survey, and the zoning map of Baltimore. I used Poisson regression with Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (MESF) for the analysis. Results: Inward population flow consistently exhibited a positive relationship with gun violence regardless of its subtype, whereas residential mobility demonstrated significant influence primarily on firearm-related robbery incidents. Moderation analysis indicated that depending on the type of gun violence being assessed, either inward population flow or residential mobility could attenuate its association with neighborhoods' crime hotspot coverage. Conclusions: Understanding collective mobility patterns is crucial for comprehending the spread of gun violence. Such insights can assist law enforcement agencies in refining hotspot policing strategies and adapting police tactics accordingly.

TI  - Analysis of the Flow of Offenders to the Metropolitan Region of Chile
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This study, based on data from 2015 to 2019 on the movement of offenders to the Metropolitan Region of Chile, uses Poisson and Negative Binomial models to analyze the flow of offenders from other Chilean regions. It confirms that factors such as gender, educational level, location of crime, and type of crime significantly motivate displacement. The profile of the typical offender is an educated man who commits crimes against property on public roads, coming mainly from neighboring and populated regions. These findings have implications for crime prevention, suggesting that strategies to prevent crime should take this into account. Future research at the commune level is proposed for a more detailed understanding of offender displacement patterns and to inform local crime-prevention strategies.

TI  - Shifts in property crime patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - ObjectivesTo estimate the dynamic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on property crime in Mexico. We do so for a longer time horizon than the existing literature and for two types of property crime: on-line and on-site.MethodsA retrospective ecological analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic using an event study methodology. This paper uses administrative data from Mexico's National Public Security System from January 2017 to December 2022. Our data is structured as a monthly series covering all 2457 Mexican municipalities.ResultsWe find heterogeneity in the pandemic's impact by type of property crime and a dynamic, permanent effect for both types of property crime. Namely, our results point to a drop and quick recovery of fraud-property crime mostly committed on-line-, which in the medium run surpasses pre-pandemic levels by 44%. Further, our results point to a significant drop in robbery, theft, domestic burglary, and motor vehicle theft-all property crimes committed on-site-, with a slight recovery after the end of the national lockdown, even though rates for these crimes never reached pre-pandemic levels.ConclusionsThe 2020 pandemic caused a permanent shift in property crime from on-site to on-line spaces. Potential mechanisms point to disruptions in mobility in retail and recreational areas, residential zones, and workplaces as important mediating factors.

TI  - Offending Patterns in Cases of Sexual Violence Committed by Multiple Perpetrators
T2  - VICTIMS & OFFENDERS
AB  - Sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators is a particularly worrying phenomenon given that the severity of psychopathological sequelae for the victims are increased when the sexual offense is committed by more than one offender. Preliminary studies showed that sexual violence committed by solo offenders is different from that of duos or groups of offenders. This study explores the heterogeneity within 983 cases of sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators, with a focus not only on offenders' modus operandi, but also victims' routine activities and situational aspects of the crime. Results from a latent class analysis identified four offending patterns: sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators where: 1) stranger victims were randomly selected; 2) offenders were geographically mobile; 3) victims were assaulted during social events; and 4) offenders were non-sexually motivated. Findings help identify situational characteristics interacting with offenders' behaviors and victims' routine activities associated with sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators. The implications regarding the heterogeneity of criminal patterns in these forms of violence is discussed in relation to police practice, situational crime prevention strategies, and future research.

TI  - Changes in Spatiotemporal Patterns of Crimes During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Atlanta, Georgia
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic provided an unprecedented environment for studying the impact of lockdowns and mobility restrictions on crime. Focusing on crimes, this study first detected emerging clusters of four types of crime (larceny, auto theft, burglary, and robbery) in Atlanta using space-time permutation scan statistics. We then investigated how the spatiotemporal patterns of these clusters changed during the pandemic (2020) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2019). Finally, we classified the detected clusters based on their duration and radius. Our results show that burglary clusters became shorter and smaller during the pandemic. The average duration and radius of statistically significant burglary clusters were 10.75 days and 0.79 km for 2019, but 6.86 days and 0.45 km for 2020, respectively. In contrast, we observed more larceny clusters that were temporally longer and spatially larger during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The duration and radius of statistically significant larceny clusters were 17.67 days and 0.46 km for 2019 and 23.22 days and 0.75 km for 2020, respectively. Furthermore, we noted a shift in the clusters from residential areas to commercial areas. We however detected a very limited number of auto theft and robbery clusters. Our findings have the potential to help prioritize future police force deployment and resource allocation in similar lockdown environments, such as pandemics or natural disasters.

TI  - Traveling to Criminal Opportunity: Defendant Mobility, Socioeconomic Context, and Prosecutorial Charge Reductions
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objective: We investigate the role that neighborhood socioeconomic contexts and defendant mobility patterns play in prosecutorial charge reductions. Methods: Using data from a large sample of criminal defendants prosecuted during 2010 to 2011 in New York County (N = 68,113), we analyze differences in charge reductions for defendants who reside and offend in low- and high-income areas, and for those who traverse socioeconomically divergent neighborhoods when committing crime. Results: Net of individual defendant characteristics, like gender and race, we find that defendants from low-income neighborhoods who offend in high-income locales are significantly less likely to benefit from discretionary charge reductions. Conclusions: Defendant mobility patterns play a key role in defining the social context of criminal punishment. This suggests it is essential to consider both where a defendant resides and where their crime is committed when assessing the role of ecological stereotypes and place-based attributions in criminal court actor decision-making.

TI  - Effects of ambient population with different income levels on the spatio-temporal pattern of theft: A study based on mobile phone big data
T2  - CITIES
AB  - Recent studies focus on how to accurately measure ambient population and its effects on crimes. However, limited attention has been paid to the internal heterogeneity of ambient population composition and its temporal variation. To fill these gaps, controlling for indicators of ambient population, social disorganization, crime generators and attractors, we model the effects of the share of low income, middle income, upper-middle income and high income of ambient population at the community level in the whole and specific time periods on weekdays and weekends. Results suggest that while all income groups of the ambient population contribute to theft at the community level, their contributions are not uniform. At different periods of both weekdays and weekends, there is no single income group that consistently predicts theft. Furthermore, the magnitude of the impact of each income group fluctuates with time. Our results highlight the heterogeneous segments of the ambient population, coupled with the dynamic human mobility patterns, structure the convergence of the crime triangle - motivated offenders, potential targets, and guardianship - in nuanced yet crucial ways.

T2  - REVISTA CRIMINALIDAD
AB  - The COVID-19 contingency gave rise to multiple social interactions for which neither governments nor citizens were prepared. The restrictive measures on mobility imposed by the National Government produced a series of changes not only in social dynamics and legal transactions, but also in the criminal context. The purpose of this study is to understand the space-time behavior of theft in the metropolitan area of Pereira, Colombia, and to compare this behavior observed under normal conditions and in times of pandemic. Data were obtained by consulting the Siedco application for the city studied in the 2019-2021 time window. The spatial analysis was performed using the technique known as pattern identification for space-time event networks (Ipree). The empirical evidence observed allows us to conclude that there is a space-time configuration that defines the dynamics of thefts in the city of Pereira and these patterns can be explained from the theory of environmental munificence for crime.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL LEGAL STUDIES
CP  - 15th Annual Conference on Empirical Legal Studies (CELS)
AB  - Government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on mobility patterns with implications for public safety and crime dynamics in countries across the planet. This paper explores the effect of stay-at-home guidelines on thefts and robberies at the neighborhood level in a Latin American city. We exploit neighborhood heterogeneity in the ability of working adults to comply with stay-at-home recommendations and use difference-in-differences and event-study designs to identify the causal effect of COVID-19 mobility restrictions on the monthly number of thefts and robberies reported to police across neighborhoods in Montevideo (Uruguay) in 2020. Our results show that neighborhoods with a higher share of residents with work-from-home jobs experienced a larger reduction in reported thefts in relation to neighborhoods with a lower share of residents with work-from-home jobs. In contrast, both groups of neighborhoods experienced a similar reduction in the number of reported robberies. These findings cast light on opportunity structures for crime but also on how crime during the pandemic has disproportionately affected more vulnerable areas and households.

TI  - Exploring the Interactive Associations between Urban Built Environment Features and the Distribution of Offender Residences with a GeoDetector Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Offender residences have become a research focus in the crime literature. However, little attention has been paid to the interactive associations between built environment factors and the residential choices of offenders. Over the past three decades, there has been an unprecedented wave of migrant workers pouring into urban centers for employment in China. Most of them flowed into urban villages within megacities. Weak personnel stability and great mobility have led to the urban villages to be closely related to decreased public safety and the deterioration of social order. The YB district in China was selected as the study area, which is located in one of the most developed cities in Southern China and has an area of approximately 800 km(2) and a population of approximately four million people. This study aims to explore the associations between the neighborhood environment and the offender residences by using the geographical detector model (GeoDetector) from the perspective of interaction. The conceptual framework is based on the social disorganization theory. The results found that urban villages were the most important variable with a relatively high explanatory power. In general, taking the urban village as the carrier, various places (hotels, entertainment places, and factories) within the urban village may be more likely to include offender residences. This study also found the social disorganization theory applicable in the non-Western context. These findings may have important implications for offender residences identification, crime prevention, and the management of urban villages in Chinese cities.

TI  - Understanding the Geography of Rape through the Integration of Data: Case Study of a Prolific, Mobile Serial Stranger Rapist Identified through Rape Kits
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Environmental criminological research on rape series is an understudied field due largely to deficiencies in official and publicly available data. Additionally, little is known about the spatial patterns of rapists with a large number of stranger rapes. With a unique integration and application of spatial, temporal, behavioral, forensic, investigative, and personal history data, we explore the geography of rape of a prolific, mobile serial stranger rapist identified through initiatives to address thousands of previously untested rape kits in two U.S. urban, neighboring jurisdictions. Rape kit data provide the opportunity for a more complete and comprehensive understanding of stranger rape series by linking crimes that likely never would have been linked if not for the DNA evidence. This study fills a knowledge gap by exploring the spatial offending patterns of extremely prolific serial stranger rapists. Through the lens of routine activities theory, we explore the motivated offender, the lack of capable guardianship (e.g., built environment), and the targeted victims. The findings have important implications for gaining practical and useful insight into rapists' use of space and behavioral decision-making processes, effective public health interventions and prevention approaches, and urban planning strategies in communities subjected to repeat targeting by violent offenders.

TI  - Criminal nomadism: A neglected dimension of spatial mobility in sex offending
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: This study investigates criminal nomadism-an individual's propensity to engage in continuous or intermittent interurban travel as a way to cope with the consequences of their criminal lifestyle and/or as a strategy to adapt to the reality of being a "career criminal." Methods: The criminal-career itinerary across Canada of 448 men convicted of sex offenses was reconstructed through individual interviews and analysis of detailed criminal records. Five distinct components of criminal nomadism (i.e., trips, nodes, paths, range, and mesolevel activity space), inspired by crime pattern theory, are suggested and analyzed. Results: Results show that criminal nomadism is the reality of young and educated Whites who have a prolific criminal career interspersed with long incarceration sentences. Nomadic offenders did not wander freely and randomly, but rather seemed to be looking for opportunities and privacy. Sex-offending variables did not make a significant contribution to predictions, suggesting that criminal nomadism is more a general offending phenomenon than something specific to sex offending. Conclusions: This study provides supporting evidence that an extensive criminal career is generally associated with a geographically scattered and nomadic lifestyle. Implications for public policies and future studies are discussed.

TI  - Optimizing the spatial scale for neighborhood environment characteristics using fine-grained data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - The neighborhood effect of environment characteristics has been an important topic in social sciences that are concerned with people's behaviors. However, defining a neighborhood and its aggregation scales are difficult challenges for the studies using neighborhood characteristics. Previous studies generally adopted fixed administrative units as the neighborhood and chose the same scale for all the variables due to data availability. Aggregation scales have a significant influence on examining the relationships between area-based input variables and outcome variables, but how to optimize the scale for each variable has been less investigated. This study proposes a multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework for simultaneously determining the optimal scale for each neighborhood environment variable and building an optimized multiscale model. First, we developed multiscale extraction methods for the socioeconomic and built environment characteristics within overlapping neighborhoods based on different types of data, including fine-grained mobile phone user data and point of interest data. Next, we proposed a random forest-based scale optimization method to quantify the impact of scales and determined an optimal spatial scale for each variable. Third, we used urban burglary risk modeling as an example, to demonstrate the usefulness of the scale optimization method. In the comparison, the model using an optimized multiscale feature set (R2 = 0.843, F1 score = 0.797 for high-risk samples) achieved better accuracy than all the models using fixed-scale combination feature sets. Moreover, the results revealed that there might be differences in the optimal scale of different neighborhood environment characteristics and demonstrated the effectiveness of our scale optimization method. Our multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework is well suited for assessing the neighborhood effect in social sciences.

TI  - Crime and police activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
AB  - This paper analyzes crime reports and police activity in Rio de Janeiro during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate there was an overall drop in crime rates starting in April, especially in property crimes, which plummet to extremely unusual levels when compared with previous patterns. This pattern is most likely associated with an unprecedented decline in public mobility in some areas of the state. We show that the most significant reductions in street robberies occurred in neighborhoods where there was a greater decline in presence on the streets. Measures of police activity, in particular drug seizures and different types of arrests, displayed a reduction comparable with the drop in criminal indicators. In contrast, the number of police killings followed a unique pattern: in April, immediately after the adoption of social distance measures, this indicator increased above the average from the previous four years; as of May, however, it assumed a downward trend, which turned into extraordinarily low levels in June. The extreme variation in the use of force by the police during the pandemic reinforces the documented dissonance between police lethality and criminal dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, shedding light on the mechanisms that regulate police violence in the state.

TI  - Criminal Mobility and Motiveless Homicide: An Investigative Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Motiveless homicides are usually defined as homicides in which a victim is killed by an offender and a motive was not determined by the police investigation. Motiveless does not mean that the police do not know the motive for the homicide, but rather that no other motive could accurately and objectively explain the reason for why the homicide occurred. However, this is especially problematic for the police because failing to establish a homicide motive is considered an investigative shortcoming. Due to the limited research conducted to date on motiveless homicides and the significant challenges they pose to investigators, the current study examines the geographic mobility patterns involved in these homicides. Using a sample of 194 solved cases of motiveless homicide from France, the criminal mobility triangle approach was used to explore their geographic patterns. Moreover, correlates of the entire criminal event were included for an in-depth understanding of these cases. The findings revealed various mobility patterns involved in motiveless homicides, combined with some specific correlates of the criminal event. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of the investigation of these crimes.

TI  - Chronic high risk of intimate partner violence against women in disadvantaged neighborhoods: An eight-year space-time analysis
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - We conducted a small-area ecological longitudinal study to analyze neighborhood contextual influences on the spatio-temporal variations in intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) risk in a southern European city over an eight-year period. We used geocoded data of IPVAW cases with associated protection orders (n = 5867) in the city of Valencia, Spain (2011-2018). The city's 552 census block groups were used as the neighborhood units. Neighborhood-level covariates were: income, education, immigrant concentration, residential instability, alcohol outlet density, and criminality. We used a Bayesian autoregressive approach to spatio-temporal disease mapping. Neighborhoods with low levels of income and education and high levels of residential mobility and criminality had higher relative risk of IPVAW. Spatial patterns of high risk of IPVAW persisted over time during the eight-year period analyzed. Areas of stable low risk and with increasing or decreasing risk were also identified. Our findings link neighborhood disadvantage to the existence and persistence over time of spatial inequalities in IPVAW risk, showing that high risk of IPVAW can become chronic in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our analytic approach provides specific risk estimates at the small-area level that are informative for intervention purposes, and can be useful to assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts in reducing IPVAW.

TI  - Opioids, Race, Context, and Journeys to Crime: Analyzing Black-White Differences in Travel Associated With Opioid Possession Offenses
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Journeys to crime, or distances traveled from residences to places of alleged crimes, describe how people enter into the criminal justice system. Race, as an ascribed characteristic of individuals and a determinant of community conditions, introduces disparities in journeys to crime. Use of opioids among nonurban, White populations and changing law enforcement responses prompt inquiry into how race affects journeys to crime associated with opioid possession. This study evaluates Black-White differences in travel among persons arrested for opioid possession in Delaware. It applies race and rationality theory to assess the effects of race and racialized context on travel patterns. Multilevel models reveal travel to possess opioids is greater for White relative to Black Delawareans. Community conditions such as marijuana possession arrest rates and concentrated disadvantage have varying impacts on travel from various geographic areas. Racial-spatial differences in travel show persistent disparities in drug law enforcement amid efforts to curb opioid misuse.

TI  - A Scoping Review of Serial Homicide Geographic Mobility Literature and Four Typologies
T2  - HOMICIDE STUDIES
AB  - The study of geographic mobility through geospatial analysis and journey-to-crime approaches has made progress in environmental criminology, finding most offenders commit crime close to their residence. However, extant literature on serial homicide and geographic mobility is scarce, specifically lacking a comprehensive appraisal of relative research. To gain a better understanding of the geographic mobility patterns of serial homicide offenders, we must determine the current status of literature in this area, to figure out where to go in terms of future research. Therefore, the following study is a scoping review of existing literature on geographic mobility and serial homicide and four associated typologies (Holmes & DeBurger's Geographic typology, Hickey's Mobility typology, Canter's Circle typology, and Rossmo's Hunting Style typology) to achieve the following: (1) Comprehensively evaluate literature regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and four associated typologies to establish the current status of research; (2) uncover potential literature gaps; and (3) provide future research recommendations. Literature sources (N = 43) on serial homicide and geographic mobility (1985-2018) were examined. While findings recognize the relevance of mobility functions in serial homicide investigations, gaps in literature were evident regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and the four associated typologies. Findings also reveal that systematic research in this field is limited. Policy implications and future research recommendations are discussed.

TI  - Criminal mobility of outlaw motorcycle gangs in Australia
T2  - TRENDS AND ISSUES IN CRIME AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - The criminal mobility of outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) members presents a significant challenge to Australian governments and police. Examining patterns of mobility can help to better understand the opportunity structures that underpin offending by OMCGs and to drive national collaborative responses to these gangs.
   This study examines the prevalence and patterns of criminal mobility in a sample of almost 4,000 OMCG members in more than 400 chapters.
   Around one in 10 members showed evidence of criminal mobility over the long term, while more than one-third of chapters comprised criminally mobile members. Criminally mobile gang members were heavily concentrated in a small number of chapters. Patterns of criminal mobility primarily involve movements into east coast jurisdictions. New South Wales and Queensland emerged as the most common destinations for criminally mobile OMCG members.

TI  - Human Mobility and Crime: Theoretical Approaches and Novel Data Collection Strategies
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CRIMINOLOGY, VOL 4
AB  - This review outlines approaches to explanations of crime that incorporate the concept of human mobility-or the patterns of movement throughout space of individuals or populations in the context of everyday routines-with a focus on novel strategies for the collection of geographically referenced data on mobility patterns. We identify three approaches to understanding mobility-crime linkages: (a) Place and neighborhood approaches characterize local spatial units of analysis of varying size with respect to the intersection in space and time of potential offenders, victims, and guardians; (b) person-centered approaches emphasize the spatial trajectories of individuals and person-place interactions that influence crime risk; and (c) ecological network approaches consider links between persons or collectivities based on shared activity locations, capturing influences of broader systems of interconnection on spatial- and individual-level variation in crime. We review data collection strategies for the measurement of mobility across these approaches, considering both the challenges and promise of mobility-based research for criminology.

TI  - Simulating Offender Mobility: Modeling Activity Nodes from Large-Scale Human Activity Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB  - In recent years, simulation techniques have been applied to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime. Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with crime prevention strategies, and exploring crime prediction techniques, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents a simulation model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. The simulation generates patterns of individual mobility aiming to cumulatively match crime patterns. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure, location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as a proxy for human activity, and taxi trip data as a proxy for human movement between regions of the city. We analyze and systematically compare 35 different mobility strategies and demonstrate the benefits of using large-scale human activity data to simulate offender mobility. The strategies combining taxi trip data or historic crime data with popular activity nodes perform best compared to other strategies, especially for robbery. Our approach provides a basis for building agent-based crime simulations that infer offender mobility in urban areas from real-world data.

TI  - Adolescent offenders' current whereabouts predict locations of their future crimes
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Knowing where crime is likely to happen can help prevent it. Here I investigate whether two basic mechanisms of human mobility-preferential return and spatial exploration-explain and predict where offenders commit future crimes. A sample of 843 adolescents reported their hourly whereabouts during four days. In line with findings from other sources and populations, their locations were concentrated and predictable. During the subsequent four years, 70 of the 843 were apprehended for committing one or more crimes. Compared to others, these 70 future offenders had visited slightly more different locations. However, their action radius and the predictability of their whereabouts had been very similar to those who would not become offenders. The offenders perpetrated most of their crimes around places they had visited before, including places where they previously offended. These findings show that the predictability of human mobility applies to offending and to offenders as well, and helps us understand and forecast where they will commit future crimes. They may prove particularly useful in criminal investigations, as they suggest that police should generally prioritize suspects who are familiar with the location of the crime and its environs, either because of their legal routine activities or because of their prior offences.

TI  - Event Locations in Extra-Familial Child Sexual Molestation Cases: The Istanbul Example
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - A great deal of attention has been devoted to sexual molestation cases, both in theory and in practice. Child molesters are versatile and are not easily identified. Various theories and tactics, the most contemporary of which is environmental criminology, have been developed to find those criminals. Locations of victims, crime scenes, and distances among them as well as other situational variables are used to predict possible future offences in environmental criminology. This study applies the theory to sexual molestation crimes in Istanbul. Dependent distance variables are found to be correlated with several situational variables in a selected sample of 127 extra-familial child sexual molestation cases.

TI  - Boyer-Moore Algorithm in retrieving deleted Short Message Service in Android Platform
T2  - 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE NUMERICAL ANALYSIS IN ENGINEERING
CP  - 10th International Conference Numerical Analysis in Engineering (NAE)
AB  - Short message service (SMS) can be used as digital evidence of disclosure of crime because it can strengthen the charges against the offenders. Criminals use various ways to destroy the evidence, including by deleting SMS. On the Android OS, SMS is stored in a SQLite database file. Deletion of SMS data is not followed by bit deletion in memory so that it is possible to rediscover the deleted SMS. Based on this case, the mobile forensic needs to be done to rediscover the short message service. The proposed method in this study is Boyer-Moore algorithm for searching string matching. An auto finds feature is designed to rediscover the short message service by searching using a particular pattern to rematch a text with the result of the hex value conversion in the database file. The system will redisplay the message for each of a match. From all the testing results, the proposed method has quite a high accuracy in rediscovering the short message service using the used dataset. The search results to rediscover the deleted SMS depend on the possibility of overwriting process and the vacuum procedure on the database file.

TI  - UK-based terrorists' antecedent behavior: A spatial and temporal analysis
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Background and purpose: Terrorism is a real and present danger. The build-up to an attack includes planning, travel, and reconnaissance which necessarily require the offender to move through their environment. Whilst research has examined patterns of terrorist attack locations, with a few exceptions (e.g. Rossmo & Harries, 2011), it has not examined the spatial behavior of the terrorists themselves. In this paper, we investigate whether the spatial mobility patterns of terrorists resemble those of criminals (and the wider population) and if these change in the run up to their attacks.
   Method: Using mobile phone data records for the ringleaders of four different UK-based terrorist plots in the months leading up to their attacks, we examine the frequency with which terrorists visit different locations, how far they travel from key anchor points such as their home, the distance between sequential cell-site hits and how their range of movement varies as the planned time to attack approaches.
   Conclusions: Like the wider population (and criminals), the sample of terrorists examined exhibited predictable patterns of spatial behavior. Most movements were close to their home location or safe house, and they visited a relatively small number of locations most of the time. Disaggregating these patterns over time provided mixed evidence regarding the way in which their spatial activity changed as the time to the planned attack approached. The findings are interpreted in terms of how they inform criminological understanding of the spatial behavior of terrorists, and the implications for law enforcement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Influence of Planned Aggression on the Journey to Homicide: An Examination Across Typology Classifications
T2  - HOMICIDE STUDIES
AB  - We assessed the impact of planned aggression across homicide mobility types in Newark, New Jersey, from 1997 through 2007. Homicides where offenders traveled to victims' resident/incident locales were more likely to involve aggressive intent, whereas homicides where victims traversed to offender/incident locales were less likely to involve planned aggression. Planned aggression was unrelated to geographically proximate (internal) homicides as well as geographically distinct (total mobility) homicides. Study findings show that routine activities and situational characteristics are not only important in explaining homicide patterns but also demonstrate that planned aggression meaningfully contributes to the routine activities and environmental criminology frameworks under specific geographic conditions.

TI  - Cross-border patterns in DNA matches between the Netherlands and Belgium
T2  - SCIENCE & JUSTICE
AB  - In this article we present the results of a study to explore if cross-border DNA matches between the Netherlands and Belgium are relatively more likely to occur in areas near the Dutch-Belgian border than in areas at some distance from this border. For this study we used the results of the transnational DNA profile exchange and comparison between the Belgian and Dutch DNA databases, which first took place in 2014.
   It appears that the Dutch regions adjacent to Belgium, i.e., Zeeland-West-Brabant, Oost-Brabant and Limburg, have relatively more DNA matches with Belgium than the other Dutch regions. In other words, a DNA profile obtained from a crime scene close to the Dutch border with Belgium is more likely to match with the profile of a person whose DNA profile is stored in the Belgian database than a DNA profile that originates from a crime scene further afield.
   Our data suggest that crimes committed by repeat offenders show a spatial pattern despite the presence of a national border, with crime scenes clustering in relatively close proximity to each other. The results of this study provide a better understanding of geographical patterns of cross-border criminal mobility. (C) 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences.

TI  - Crime Risk Estimation with a Commuter-Harmonized Ambient Population
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Residential population data are frequently employed to link the crime incidence of an area with the number of residents to estimate the underlying risk. Human mobility patterns cause shifts in the baseline population, however, that can potentially influence the crime statistics. This study therefore employed an ambient population that combined residential population data with data depicting the commuting activity in small administrative areas. The effects of the commuter-harmonized ambient population on crime were then evaluated in a series of negative binomial regression models. The models also controlled for criminogenic factors and incorporated eigenvector spatial filtering to adjust for spatial effects. The results show significant effects of commuting patterns on crime outcomes. For certain crimes, such as violence, theft, and disorder, the inbound commuters are significantly associated with high risk. It was further discovered that an offset variable comprising the commuter-harmonized ambient population data models the crime outcomes more reliably than when residential population data are used. Spatial filtering was found to effectively eradicate residual spatial autocorrelation after accounting for effects of the predictor variables. We conclude that calculating crime rates using the residential population does not constitute an accurate risk measure and that the ambient population has crucial implications for realistic and reliable target representation and crime modeling.

The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. Our study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. Our findings indicate that individual-level characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

TI  - Impact of the cultural and the urban topography influences in serial sex offenses patterns
T2  - ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES
AB  - Objectives. - This article deals about an aspect not taken into consideration often when considering violent sexual offenses. The term "crime scene", which got widespread into common language, depicts all the elements collected at the place where a crime occurred and which could later become pieces of evidence. However, the place by itself, the link between the offender and the place, the influence of the urban environment and the cultural aspect of it do not receive that much attention in the literature. This paper originates from a comparison of the work of two psychologists specialized within the field of geoprofiling, D. Canter and K. Rossmo, the latter being a Canadian citizen and the former an Englishman. If their postulates were similar, their findings however diverged. If primary caretakers and early interactions are not to be underestimated regarding their roles into the personality development, we will in these pages consider the urban environment by itself in serial sexual offenses.
   Methods. - Due to a restricted access to this type of patients, we mainly focused our hypothesis on a literature review and a few patients of ours, met during previous research works. Concepts used in this paper overlap various fields such as psychodynamic, criminology, criminalistics, psycho-sociology and even urbanism. We focused in this paper onto the importance of the culture and the urban concrete environment as probable variables explaining these discrepancies observed into the behavioral patterns and distances covered by Serial Sex Offenders between the two shores of the Atlantic. The underlying question being how their space conception, their "mental maps", depends of the culture they were bred in and how it could have an incident onto their offense zones?
   Results. - The findings highlight an inherently cultural variation of the spatial conception, but also how the space is built up and integrated between the USA (and all the large and historically "recents" territories) and Europe. American sexual serial offenders are more likely to cover larger distances, almost twice as much than their European counterparts. It seems that our hypothesis is relevant; a cultural distinction may exist on the way spatial environment is perceived and could thus have incidences into the offense patterns.
   Conclusions. - With the development of the E.U., our spatial conceptions as European citizens evolve. Thanks to mass transportation, and the Erasmus programs, it is not uncommon for an Italian individual to study in Scotland or Finland for instance. This is of some importance into how the spatial mobility is becoming more thinkable, and somehow how it induces a shrinkage of the distance into the mental mapping process.

TI  - An investigation of anonymous and spoof SMS resources used for the purposes of cyberstalking
T2  - DIGITAL INVESTIGATION
AB  - In 2012, the United Kingdom actively sought to tackle acts of stalking through amendments to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Now, not only is stalking a recognised criminal offence, acts associated with stalking behaviour have finally been properly defined in legislation. Further, the role of technology in digital stalking offences, frequently termed as acts of cyberstalking, has been duly highlighted. The prosecution of such cyberstalking offences is reliant on the forensic analysis of devices capable of communication with a victim, in order to identify the offender and evidence the offending content for presentation to a court of law. However, with the recent proliferation of anonymous communication services, it is becoming increasingly difficult for digital forensic specialists to analyse and detect the origin of stalking messages, particularly those involving mobile devices. This article identifies the legal factors involved, along with a scenario-based investigation of sample anonymous and spoof SMS (Short Message Service) messages, documenting the evidence that remains on a victim's handset for the purpose of locating an offender, which often may be minimal or non-existent.

TI  - The Agent-Based Spatial Simulation to the Burglary in Beijing
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2014, PT IV
CP  - 14th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
AB  - Since the Agent-based simulation tool was introduced into criminology research, most work concentrated on crime theory validation or hypothesis testing, little was contributed to crime spatial pattern replication. In this paper, using street network and subway network as the landscape and proposing a statistic-based instead of predefined human mobility pattern as the individual's routine activity, the spatial distribution of burglary in Beijing is simulated and valid by the actual pattern. The result indicates that the Agent-based modeling method partly detects the crime hotspots and the spatial pattern of crime, and specifically the crime level on the nodes with different accessibility is proved to be identical to the actual one. The study made in this work demonstrates that Agent-based modeling is a potential tool to predict or explain crime pattern in space, and also some further work which aims to improve its validation is discussed in the end of this paper.

TI  - Journey "During" Crime: Predicting Criminal Mobility Patterns in Sexual Assaults
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - The aim of this study was to test whether there is a relationship between situational and modus operandi characteristics and criminal mobility during the sexual assault event. Data collected from both police files and semistructured interviews with 72 serial sex offenders who have committed 361 sexual assaults have been used. Negative binomial regression was used to identify the relationships between the situational and modus operandi characteristics and the criminal mobility exhibited during the sexual assault. Events that involved child or adolescent victims, those where the offender did not use pornography prior to crime, and those where victim resistance was observed exhibited more criminal mobility. Moreover, crimes in which the victim was selected, the victim was alone when approached by the offender, and the assault was characterized by sexual penetration and a lack of premeditation exhibited more criminal mobility. Results seem to suggest that criminal mobility is a goal-oriented action taken by serial sex offenders to successfully complete their crime and to avoid detection and apprehension.

TI  - Need drugs, will travel?: The distances to crime of illegal drug buyers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: This study examines distances to crime among illegal drug buyers while controlling for buyer, drug, and destination characteristics.
   Methods: Geocoded arrests for drug buyers in an urban municipality, over a three year period, spatially identify major drug markets. Negative binomial regression is used to model compositional characteristics of drug arrestees and contextual effects of markets on distance to arrest (n=4,082).
   Results: Trip distance to drug purchase arrest varies by drug market. Being white, and having prior contact with the criminal justice system correlated with longer trip distances. Additional compositional effects vary by drug type.
   Conclusions: In line with prior journey to crime research and crime pattern theory, illicit drug buyers are arrested in close proximity of their homes. Future research should consider the extent to which short aggregate market distances reflect policing differentials and close social ties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does the mobility of foreign offenders fit the general pattern of mobility?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Research on offender mobility is directed to three main elements: distance, anchor points, and direction. Previous research in geographical criminology has revealed that: (1) the journey to crime is limited in distance and follows a distance decay pattern; (2) the home of the offender plays a central role as the starting point of crime trips; and (3) the direction of the trip is influenced by the opportunities to commit crimes. The findings are more or less accepted as 'laws' in the field. However, research on offender mobility is often limited by its method, data and sample of arrested offenders. This study, in contrast, investigated a sample of arrested foreign offenders (East Europeans) who were staying temporarily in Belgium. They lack the space awareness and routine activities of residential offenders. Using multiple methods and data, including police statistics, case file analysis and offender interviews, we investigated the travelling patterns of these offenders both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings demonstrate that: (1) the degree of distance decay is much more moderate than generally found in the literature; (2) the official living address plays hardly any role at all as an anchor point; and (3) these offenders travel away from opportunity structures, which is different from the routine activity patterns of Belgian offenders. Overall, our findings indicate that offender mobility does not fit the accepted general pattern or 'laws' as assumed in previous research.

TI  - Identifying Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Articulated Criminal Offending: An Application Using Phenomenologically Meaningful Police Jurisdictional Geographies
T2  - SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Improving our understanding of the differentials, articulation and mobility of criminal offending within and between urban and rural areas may ultimately have important policy implications for the allocation of valuable federal, state and local resources. This paper introduces a new comprehensive place level system delineation, which corresponds directly to meaningful police jurisdictional coverage areas. This coverage allows for the implementation of a multivariate spatial econometric technique that has the potential to contribute to law enforcement's ability to combat criminal offending through the introduction of an algorithm for the tracking of the almost 'real time' spatial mobility of crime. The results suggest a more robust application of spatial clustering statistics in identifying spatio-temporal relationships in the spatial mobility of crime. It is expected that the ability to track criminal offending in a more 'real-time' manner can have direct implications on future research concerned with the simulation of crime-specific offending patterns.

TI  - ALL OFFENDERS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS: VARIATION IN JOURNEYS TO CRIME BETWEEN OFFENDERS*
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - The results of this study reveal a major methodological problem with an established body of criminological literature-the journey to crime. The dominant finding of such research is that most crimes occur close to an offender's home. Consequently, journeys to crime typically display a distance-decay function that is assumed to exist between and within offenders. However, most journey-to-crime studies use nested data-individual offenders contributing multiple crime trips-yet employ analytic methods that fail to account for this property, leading to inference and aggregation concerns. In the study outlined in this article, we demonstrated the implications of using nested data for analyzing the journey to crime. We showed that once controlling for nesting, only a few (prolific) offenders display a distance decay pattern. Implications of the findings for theory and future research are discussed.

TI  - Journey to crime of "itinerant crime groups"
T2  - POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - Most researchers have found that property crimes have a local focus: offenders tend to operate in the vicinity of their residence. This has led the police to organise themselves to concentrate their resources in highly populated, urban areas, Over the last decade mobile property offenders have been found in various Western European countries that differ from this norm. These groups of mainly Eastern European multiple offenders engaging in property crime tend to travel further than other offenders. As such, their operations differ from most criminals, challenging the way the police are organised and undermining criminological theories on journey to crime. The aim of this paper is to look at the specificity of mobility patterns of these groups, to examine the precise interpretation of their mobility and to consider the implications.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the Belgian police database containing all serious property crimes in Belgium for the period 2002-2006. Some basic offender characteristics have been identified and for these offenders journey-to-crime patterns have been established.
   Findings - Eastern European multiple offending groups tend to commit their crimes in rural areas. Although they start their journey in regions considered "crime importing", they carry out their crimes in "crime exporting" areas. As such, they are atypical, challenging traditional theories on journey-to-crime and the way in which police forces are organised.
   Research limitations/implications - Observing a special group is one thing, but explaining these differences is another. Further research is needed, in particular with regard to the motivational aspects for these offenders.
   Originality/value - Whereas most researchers have found crime (including property crime) to be mainly local, the present research focuses on more mobile offenders. The challenges that these groups create for law enforcement authorities make it important for them and their patterns of activity to be understood.

AB  - This study examines the impact of criminal mobility on criminal earning patterns in a sample of incarcerated offenders who reported their criminal experiences over a three-year period. Criminal mobility is indicated by an individual's offending perimeter and not the traditional journey-to-crime measure. Findings reveal that the offending perimeter length is a factor of criminal achievement in that mobile offenders reported higher financial earnings from crime than immobile offenders. Greater distances traveled for crime were also generally associated with higher criminal earnings, but this was more salient for predatory offenders than market offenders.

TI  - Sex offender community notification and community stratification
T2  - JUSTICE QUARTERLY
AB  - Community notification laws have been passed by the federal government and legislature of every state. At the very least, these laws require local law enforcement officials to publicize the personal and residential information of known sex offenders. Although researchers and other social commentators have begun to assess the effects of community notification on targeted sex offenders and on criminal justice practices and practitioners, the potential consequences of the policy for different types of communities have received only scant attention. Using sex offender registry and US Census data for two states (Nebraska and Oklahoma), we examine the relationship between community characteristics and the residential patterns of sex offenders. Findings from mapping and regression analyses suggest a greater concentration of sex offenders in disadvantaged communities than in more affluent communities. To the extent that community notification allows residents of more affluent communities to mobilize resources in order to remove identified sex offenders, it may increase the geographical clustering of these offenders in areas already facing a greater risk and having fewer resources to manage the problem. Implications of findings in terms of "concentrated disadvantage" are discussed.

TI  - Spatial characteristics of serial sexual assault in New Zealand
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the crime patterns of New Zealand serial sexual assualters in order to determine the extent to which such offenders display spatial behaviour in line with their overseas counterparts. Hypotheses concerning journey to crime, criminal range and spatial pattern were tested. Geographical information on 76 serial offenders was extracted from police files and mapped. A series of spatial analyses were conducted in order to examine the spatial mobility of the offenders. It was found that, in line with much overseas research, offenders typically did not travel very far to offend (a median of 3 km) and operated over identifiable criminal ranges. However, in contrast to much overseas research into serial spatial patterns, New Zealand offenders were characterised by transience and commuting patterns of behaviour rather than a predominant marauder style. The implications of these findings for geographic profiling are discussed.

TI  - Sequential angulation, spatial dispersion and consistency of distance attack patterns from home in serial murder, rape and burglary
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY CRIME & LAW
AB  - Three related measures of spatial movement (sequential angulation, spatial dispersion and consistency of distance in attack target) were compared across three serial offence types: serial homicide (n = 35), serial rape (n = 41) and serial burglary (n = 30). In each case, each offender had committed at least five offences. "Spatial dispersion", defined as the extent to which an offender distributes his offences across either a focused or relatively more evenly distributed area, revealed that burglary was less evenly distributed (i.e. more focused) than rape and murder. "Sequential angulation", defined as the degree of rotational movement around the home of the offender from one offence to the next, revealed that serial murderers have higher angulation scores than do rapists who, in turn, have higher angulation scores than burglars. Lastly, a comparison of the offender's consistency in the relative distance travelled from home to each attack site ("consistency of distance in attack target") was relatively similar across the three groups. This was despite the comparison of different serial offence types from disparate geographical areas. The supposition that differences in dispersion and sequential angulation scores across crime types are related to the perceived risk of the crime has been confirmed. The specificity and the mobility of the targets are also discussed.

TI  - Investigating potential differences between cocaine users and distributors using the ion mobility spectrometer
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
AB  - This article examines the possibility of using the ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) to discern the difference between persons who distribute cocaine and those who do not distribute cocaine based on their patterns of cocaine contamination. Criminal justice practitioners who monitor offenders rely primarily upon urinalysis to defect drug use by their clientele. However, since drug distribution is a profitable enterprise for many, persons may continue to engage in drug sales even after desisting from use, in this paper we attempt to determine whether or not a distinct contamination profile exists for persons who admit continued involvement in drug sales and drug sales and use when contrasted to those who deny drug sales but continue to use or deny any drug involvement whatsoever. The findings of our examination and analysis are only moderately supportive of the discernable difference between users and distributors but sufficient, in our view, to continue examining the technology for a potential application to this problem.

TI  - Do neighborhoods have boundaries? A novel empirical test for a historic question
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Do neighborhoods have boundaries? Scholars have debated how neighborhoods should be operationalized for decades. While recent scholarship has de-emphasized boundaries, I argue that boundaries are focal to understanding what neighborhoods are and why they are so segregated. Relying on everyday mobility patterns data from a panel of 45 million nationally representative devices, I demonstrate that divisions between contiguous census block groups in terms of everyday mobility patterns align with divisions in race, educational attainment, occupation, and age. Employing a novel clustering procedure, I further demonstrate that sets of census block groups can be easily separated in terms of differences in mobility patterns, indicating that meaningful clusters and boundaries within cities do exist. Subsequent results indicate these clusters are uniquely segregated in terms of race, educational attainment, and age, highlighting how other spatial aggregations can underestimate true segregation. Additional results suggest that unique social processes divide these clusters from one another, as indicated by exceptional variation in both COVID-19 case incidence and criminal offense timing. While I do not believe these clusters represent objective "neighborhoods," I do assert that they can serve as a useful geographical unit for social analyses. These clusters may also be useful for measuring segregation in mobility patterns as well as for studying mobility network resiliency.

TI  - Bricks or cooks? Geographical and social determinants of the investment choices of mafia-type organized crime
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY & CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - This article studies legitimate businesses confiscated from mafia groups in Italy to assess whether mafia investment patterns across industries depend on the characteristics of the geographical environment in which infiltrated firms operate. We carry out a spatial regression analysis of more than 1700 firms, with special emphasis on restaurants/hotels and construction, confiscated from mafia groups in Italy against a set of variables related to the social and criminal environment (with a special emphasis on mafia presence) after controlling for the local business structure and the economic/financial composition of the areas. Ceteris paribus, mafia investments in the construction industry are greater in regions with a higher level of mafia presence, infiltration of public administration and more protected markets; while investments in bars, restaurants and hotels are greater in areas characterized by less rooted mafia presence, higher violence, higher trade openness and cash intensity. The results suggest that mafia investments in construction can benefit from the opportunities offered by grip on the territory and on the public administration; and those in restaurants by concealment drivers, such as money laundering. This article contributes to the understanding of the geography of mafia economy and of the mobility of mafia groups beyond territories of origin, by highlighting the possible instrumental use of legitimate businesses, and the relationship between mafias' migration and infiltration mechanisms.

TI  - The prophet on trial: Baptist dissenters before the Soviet courts, 1960s-1980s
T2  - CANADIAN SLAVONIC PAPERS
AB  - This article explores the courtroom behaviour of adherents of the oppositional dissenter wing within the Evangelical Baptist community in the Soviet Union, who faced trials for violating Soviet religious laws between the 1960s and 1980s. The analysis reveals that the accused believers developed a nuanced defence strategy encompassing three core elements: mobilizing support from their fellow believers in courtrooms, constructing communicative patterns that involved drawing prosecutors and judges into theologically driven dialogues about truth, and employing distinctive rhetoric aimed at questioning the legal foundations and legitimacy of Soviet religious policy. The accused Baptists adopted a marked confrontational stance towards state officials in charge of criminal prosecutions and trials, striving to overcome them in argument. Ultimately, the courtrooms became a platform for them to voice and promote their faith-based views on state politics and freedom.

TI  - Development of conductive fingermarks for forensic applications
T2  - FORENSIC SCIENCE MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY
AB  - Fingermarks are an important form of evidence in forensic science, routinely used for identification or exclusion purposes within the criminal justice system. The increasing use of fingerprint recognition in technology and biosecurity, such as for unlocking devices and accessing banking information, highlights the need for forensic fingermark recovery methods that serve both traditional forensic needs and modern technological demands. Current fingerprint development techniques, however, are not designed to fulfil this dual-purpose. This paper presents a novel approach that introduces the use of conductive paint and silicone to develop, recover, and preserve latent, patent, and plastic fingermarks. The innovative method produces conductive casts that capture detailed ridge patterns, thereby facilitating forensic examination as well as being used for unlocking capacitive and ultrasonic fingerprint scanners in a range of mobile devices.

TI  - Municipal police and the economic mobility gap between black and white males in the US
T2  - RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY
AB  - Estimates of intergenerational economic mobility for a recent U.S. birth cohort published by Opportunity Insights reveal a striking empirical puzzle: while there is a substantial gap in the upward mobility outcomes achieved by low-income Black and White males there is no such racial mobility gap for females. This study examines municipal police force size as a potential driver of these disparate mobility patterns. Although a larger police force may enhance mobility outcomes for all low-income children through reducing exposure to crime, for Black males prior work suggests this will be offset by the disparate negative impact of increased contact with the criminal justice system. Analyzing a sample of 200 major U.S. cities, linear models find a positive association between the number of police officers per capita and the size of the racial mobility gap for males, but not for females. We go on to show more police personnel in the late 1990s is associated with an increased gap in the likelihood of incarceration for Black males relative to White males. Taken together, our findings point to the heterogeneous impacts of policing for different race-sex groups as one potential explanation for why we observe a racial mobility gap between Black and White males and why this gap is larger in some cities and smaller in others.

TI  - Unveiling local patterns of child pornography consumption in France using Tor
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Child pornography-better known as child sexual abuse material (CSAM)-represents a severe form of exploitation and victimization of children, leaving the victims with emotional and physical trauma. In this study, we aim to analyze local patterns of CSAM consumption across 1341 French communes in 20 metropolitan regions of France between March 16 to May 31, 2019 using fine-grained mobile traffic data of Tor network-related web services. We estimate that approx. 0.08% of Tor mobile download traffic observed in France is linked to the consumption of CSAM by correlating it with local-level temporal porn consumption patterns. This compares to 0.19% of what we conservatively estimate to be the share of CSAM content in global Tor traffic. In line with existing literature on the link between sexual child abuse and the consumption of image-based content thereof, we observe a positive and statistically significant effect of our CSAM consumption estimates on the reported number of victims of sexual violence and vice versa, which validates our findings, after controlling for a set of geographically disaggregated features including socio-demographic characteristics, voting behavior, nearby points of interest and Google Trends queries. While this is a first, exploratory attempt to look at CSAM from a spatial epidemiological angle, we believe this research provides public health officials with valuable information to prioritize target areas for public awareness campaigns as another step to fulfill the global community's pledge to target 16.2 of the sustainable development goals: "end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence and torture against children".

TI  - Urban routines, spatial occupancy, and their effects on outdoor crime in Barcelona
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Based on mobile phone data from the city of Barcelona, Spain, generalized linear models are used to analyse the relationship between urban mobilities and the spatial and temporal patterning of robbery and theft. The hypothesis was made that mobility fluxes may undermine social control mechanisms by altering the socio-demographic composition of urban populations, therefore increasing the risk of crime victimization. The analysis brought together indicators of land use and a measure of the ambient population disaggregated by different profiles of public space users (by sex, age, and place of residence). The results indicate that robbery and theft tend to cluster around locations that attract a higher proportion of non-residents (i.e. national and international visitors). Non-local visitors, who visit the city occasionally or once in a lifetime, lack a comprehensive knowledge of the environment which would help them to navigate safely through the urban space. Therefore, their presence not only unsettles the social routines of public spaces in Barcelona but also reflects negatively in terms of crime occurrence. This finding raises questions about how to accommodate growing mobilities in our cities without detriment to incumbent residents and their safety, which seems to be critical in post-COVID-19 urban planning.

TI  - Spatial analysis of outdoor indecent assault risk: a study using ambient population data
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - Spatiotemporal data on ambient populations have recently become widely available. Although previous studies have indicated a link between the spatial patterns of crime occurrence and ambient population distribution, more detailed information, such as the population most likely to be victims by gender and age group, could better predict the risk of crime occurrence. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the risk of indecent assault, a typical crime with a high number of young female victims, in southern Kyoto Prefecture. We utilized population distribution by gender and age group at different times of the day. After extracting daily patterns (factors) of the population using non-negative matrix factorization, we statistically modeled the risk of indecent assault using a spatial conditional autoregressive model. The results showed that the model, which considered a spatiotemporal ambient population, demonstrated superior performance during nighttime hours. Furthermore, by interpreting the factors significantly associated with the risk of crime occurrence, the findings provided valuable insights into local crime prevention measures that consider daily temporal changes in the gender and age-group composition of individuals present in a specific area.

TI  - Intimate partner violence and third-party legal mobilization: considering the role of sexuality, gender, and violence severity
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - ObjectivesThis study examines how sexuality, gender, and severity affect the willingness of third parties to mobilize facets of the criminal justice system in response to witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV).MethodsAn M-Turk online sample of 803 adults in the USA completed a factorial vignette survey. Participants were presented with an incident of intimate partner violence and asked to report how likely they would be to notify police and select jail as punishment for the perpetrator.ResultsResults of the study uncover no clear evidence of heteronormative bias. Rather, female victims of IPV garner the most support from third parties. Furthermore, respondents were more likely to favor a jail sentence for male perpetrators. Patterns were amplified in severe incidents.ConclusionThe current study suggests that gender and violence severity, rather than sexuality, are the most salient predictors of the third-party's decision to notify the police and prefer strong criminal justice punishments.

TI  - Mobilities and the flexible boundaries of the neighbourhood. A test with crime data in Barcelona
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This paper incorporates an explicit mobility dimension into the definition of the neighbourhood and explores its possible implications for the study of spatially distributed phenomena. We analysed the distribution of robbery and theft in Barcelona, Spain, as a testing application. Crime data were aggregated to nonoverlapping units (census tracts) and to a new measure of overlapping neighbourhoods, that we named 'walkhoods', accounting for the distance that can be covered in 5 min at a walking speed of 1 m/s, considering all possible physical barriers. The outcomes of regression models shed new light on the relationship between mobility and crime. When the walkhood scale is established, human mobility patterns have a stronger effect on the outcome variables than when census tracts are used. Results point to walkability constraints and social distances imposed by the massive presence of sporadic users in public spaces as strong predictors of crime occurrence, arguably due to their negative effects on neighbourhood social ties formation. Our findings suggest that more flexible definitions of the neighbourhood could address the social and spatial heterogeneity of urban spaces more properly than traditional approaches.

TI  - Unraveling the influence of income-based ambient population heterogeneity on theft spatial patterns: insights from mobile phone big data analysis
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - While previous research has underscored the profound influence of the ambient population distribution on the spatial dynamics of crime, the exploration regarding the impact of heterogeneity within the ambient population, such as different income groups, on crime is still in its infancy. With the support of mobile phone big data, this study constructs an index of ambient population heterogeneity to represent the complexity of the social environment. After controlling for the effects of total ambient population, nonlocal rate, transportation accessibility, crime attractors, and crime generators, this study employs a negative binomial regression model to examine the influence of ambient population heterogeneity and different income groups on the spatial manifestations of thefts. The findings indicate that ambient population heterogeneity significantly escalates the incidence of thefts, with middle and upper-middle-income groups acting as more attractive targets, whereas the higher-income group exerts a deterrent effect. The interaction analysis shows that increased population heterogeneity contributes to social disorder, thereby amplifying the attractiveness of the ambient population to perpetrators. These conclusions highlight the crucial role of ambient population heterogeneity in explaining crime dynamics and therefore enrich the routine activity theory.

TI  - Exploring income and racial inequality in preparedness for Hurricane Ida (2021): insights from digital footprint data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Preparedness for adverse events is critical to building urban resilience to climate-related risks. While most extant studies investigate preparedness patterns based on survey data, this study explores the potential of big digital footprint data (i.e. population visits to points of interest (POI)) to investigate preparedness patterns in the real case of Hurricane Ida (2021). We further investigate income and racial inequality in preparedness by combining the digital footprint data with demographic and socioeconomic data. A clear pattern of preparedness was seen in Louisiana with aggregated visits to grocery stores, gasoline stations, and construction supply dealers increasing by nearly 9%, 12%, and 10% respectively, representing three types of preparedness: survival, mobility planning, and hazard mitigation. Preparedness for Hurricane Ida was not seen in New York and New Jersey states. Inequality analyses for Louisiana across census block groups (CBGs) demonstrate that CBGs with higher income have more (nearly 8% greater) preparedness in visiting gasoline stations, while CBGs with a larger percentage of the white population have more preparedness in visiting grocery stores (nearly 12% more) in the lowest income groups. The results indicate that income and racial inequality differ across different preparedness in terms of visiting different POIs.

TI  - Crime, pandemic and social mobility: Empirical evidence from Turkiye
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Criminal behavior, which takes its content from society, has been associated with social isolation, national quarantine, and mandatory stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been researched through crime rates. Moreover, it has been argued that changes in the level of social mobility also affect crime rates. Decreased crime rates have been reported during closure measures, and a significant literature has emerged based on these propositions. This study's retrospective approach was created to examine the appearance of crime rates in Turkiye. The main problem of the research is to reveal the relationship between crime, pandemic, and social mobility in Turkiye. For this purpose, it aimed to test the propositions based on a dual approach. First, patterns in crime rates were discovered. The data set regarding the most common crime types between 2018 and 2022, including pre-pandemic crime rates, was used. The most appropriate time series model was determined to understand the data structure regarding crime types, and it was tested whether there was a decrease or increase in crime rates during and after the pandemic. As a second step, the effect of social mobility on the change in crime was examined according to the mobility level data reported in this process. Evidence has shown decreased violence, theft, and drug crimes in the early part of the pandemic, consistent with the literature. While theft crimes decreased throughout the pandemic, violence and drug crimes increased. The view that crime rates will decrease if social mobility is restricted as a source of social life presented overlapping data in the pandemic. Changes in social mobility during the pandemic have affected crime rates for theft, injury, and drug use. Although there was a decrease in crime rates due to seasonal effects after the normalization process, it was observed that crime rates could change according to the content of social measures during the pandemic period. It is considered that this situation presents a particular slice for the future.

TI  - Dry growing seasons predicted Central American migration to the US from 2012 to 2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Controlling for factors such as criminal violence and poverty, we tested if drier than usual growing season weather was a predictor of emigration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the US between 2012 and 2018. We focus on growing season weather because agriculture is a primary transmission pathway from the effects of climate change upon migration. We secured the migration apprehensions data for our analysis through a FOIA request to US Customs and Border Protection. Border Patrol intake interviews recorded the original home location of families that arrived at the southern US border. We used this geographic information to measure recent weather patterns and social circumstances in the area that each family departed. We found 70.7% more emigration to the US when local growing seasons in Central America were recently drier than the historical average since 1901.

TI  - 106 Cases of homicide poisoning in China-A retrospective study
T2  - LEGAL MEDICINE
AB  - Homicidal poisoning has received limited scholarly attention, despite having recently increased in frequency in China, especially in rural areas, where it causes numerous deaths and disabilities. In this study, the author collected data on 106 cases of homicidal poisoning from 1995 to 2000. Of these cases 105 were found through website established by the Supreme Court of China, and one case was as an exception identified from the internet. There were 46 male perpetrators and 59 female perpetrators. The most common reason male perpetrators poisoned someone was conflict among neighbours (include residents in the same village) (ten cases), and the most common reason female perpetrators did so was an affair (13 cases). Compared with the perpetrators of general homicide, those who poisoned people included a high proportion of female, elderly, and well-educated individuals. This is related to the nonviolent nature of the poisoning, which requires no physical strength. Residents living in rural and urban areas chose poisoning based on convenience. People living in rural areas used pesticides most often, and people in urban areas have greater access to drugs or medications obtained at work or online. In this study, a total of 9.4% of the perpetrators were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders or psychosis. In all, the 106 cases resulted in 58 human deaths. Tetramine and paraquat caused many of the deaths, and this suggests a need for the government to manage and monitor these highly toxic pesticides. These cases are representative of issues in contemporary Chinese society, for example, population mobility, fierce competition.

TI  - A global analysis of violence against women defenders in environmental conflicts
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Women environmental defenders face retaliation for mobilizing against extractive and polluting projects, which perpetrate violence against Indigenous, minority, poor and rural communities. The issue matters because it highlights the gendered nature of extractive violence and the urgent need to address the systemic patterns of violence that affect women defenders, who are often overlooked and underreported. Here we analyse violence against women defenders in environmental conflicts around the world. We use data from the Environmental Justice Atlas and employ log-linear and binomial regressions to find statistically significant patterns in displacement, repression, criminalization, violent targeting and assassinations committed against women defenders in extractive conflicts. Statistical results indicate that violence against women defenders is concentrated among mining, agribusiness and industrial conflicts in the geographical South. Repression, criminalization and violent targeting are closely linked, while displacement and assassination appear as extreme outcomes when conflict violence worsens. Women defenders experience high rates of violence regardless of countries' governance accountability and gender equality. This work contributes to the broader sustainability agenda by highlighting the need to address the impacts of extractive activities on women.
   Natural resource extraction often involves violence against environmental defenders, but threats to women defenders tend to be poorly documented. This study analyses displacement, repression, criminalization, violent targeting and assassinations of women environmental defenders worldwide.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Mobile Phone Data in Crime Applications: A Coherent Taxonomy Based on Data Types and Analysis Perspectives, Challenges, and Future Research Directions
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Digital technologies have recently become more advanced, allowing for the development of social networking sites and applications. Despite these advancements, phone calls and text messages still make up the largest proportion of mobile data usage. It is possible to study human communication behaviors and mobility patterns using the useful information that mobile phone data provide. Specifically, the digital traces left by the large number of mobile devices provide important information that facilitates a deeper understanding of human behavior and mobility configurations for researchers in various fields, such as criminology, urban sensing, transportation planning, and healthcare. Mobile phone data record significant spatiotemporal (i.e., geospatial and time-related data) and communication (i.e., call) information. These can be used to achieve different research objectives and form the basis of various practical applications, including human mobility models based on spatiotemporal interactions, real-time identification of criminal activities, inference of friendship interactions, and density distribution estimation. The present research primarily reviews studies that have employed mobile phone data to investigate, assess, and predict human communication and mobility patterns in the context of crime prevention. These investigations have sought, for example, to detect suspicious activities, identify criminal networks, and predict crime, as well as understand human communication and mobility patterns in urban sensing applications. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted on crime research studies that were published between 2014 and 2022 and listed in eight electronic databases. In this review, we evaluated the most advanced methods and techniques used in recent criminology applications based on mobile phone data and the benefits of using this information to predict crime and detect suspected criminals. The results of this literature review contribute to improving the existing understanding of where and how populations live and socialize and how to classify individuals based on their mobility patterns. The results show extraordinary growth in studies that utilized mobile phone data to study human mobility and movement patterns compared to studies that used the data to infer communication behaviors. This observation can be attributed to privacy concerns related to acquiring call detail records (CDRs). Additionally, most of the studies used census and survey data for data validation. The results show that social network analysis tools and techniques have been widely employed to detect criminal networks and urban communities. In addition, correlation analysis has been used to investigate spatial-temporal patterns of crime, and ambient population measures have a significant impact on crime rates.

TI  - Individualization and the decline of homicide: England 1250-1750
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - A key issue in criminology is to account for variation in rates of violence across time and place. An important variable largely neglected in the literature is individualism. Building on theoretical ideas proposed by Durkheim, Black, and Baumgartner, we illustrate the role of increased individualism with a case study: the decline of ho-micide in England, 1250-1750. The qualitative historical materials we present reveal the growth of more individualized conflicts evident in less third-party partisan intervention and a reduced concern with honor. More individualized conflicts were, in turn, a product of a more individualized society, one characterized by increased social distance and mobility. As conflicts individualized they became less lethal, resulting in declining aggregate rates of homicide. Although the case study is historical, our argument has implications for understanding contemporary criminal violence.

TI  - Crime by outlaw motorcycle gang members during club conflicts
T2  - TRENDS AND ISSUES IN CRIME AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - | This study examines the trends in and spatial distribution of recorded offending by Australian outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) affiliates at the onset of a territorial conflict between two clubs in the state of New South Wales.Results show an increase in recorded offending by OMCG affiliates involved in the conflict and based in the disputed territory. Comparable increases in recorded offending by these clubs were not detected in the areas surrounding this territory or in the rest of New South Wales, and there was little mobility into the conflict region by those outside of it. There was a smaller, short-lived increase in recorded crime by affiliates of other gangs in the conflict region but not elsewhere. In short, changes in offending patterns were largely limited to the clubs involved in the conflict and localised to the territory in dispute.

TI  - Learning Viewpoint-Invariant Features for LiDAR-Based Gait Recognition
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Gait recognition is a biometric identification method based on individual walking patterns. This modality is applied in a wide range of applications, such as criminal investigations and identification systems, since it can be performed at a long distance and requires no cooperation of interests. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition systems, and previous studies have utilized depth information captured by RGB-D cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect. In recent years, multi-layer LiDAR sensors, which can obtain range images of a target at a range of over 100 m in real time, have attracted significant attention in the field of autonomous mobile robots and self-driving vehicles. Compared with general cameras, LiDAR sensors have rarely been used for biometrics due to the low point cloud densities captured at long distances. In this study, we focus on improving the robustness of gait recognition using LiDAR sensors under confounding conditions, specifically addressing the challenges posed by viewing angles and measurement distances. First, our recognition model employs a two-scale spatial resolution to enhance immunity to varying point cloud densities. In addition, this method learns the gait features from two invariant viewpoints (i.e., left-side and back views) generated by estimating the walking direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention block that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise weights to fuse the features from the aforementioned resolutions and viewpoints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-view, cross-distance challenges, and practical scenarios.

TI  - Improving the Ability of Persons Identification in a Video Files Based on Hybrid Intelligence Techniques
T2  - NEXT GENERATION OF INTERNET OF THINGS
CP  - International Conference on Next Generation of Internet of Things (ICNGIoT)
AB  - With the advancement in technology, the importance of person recognition in photographs or videos has grown due to its usefulness in the search for wanted persons and criminal identification using various theories and algorithms and various non-hybrid and hybrid techniques to identify the person through the face, and its features have been developed. The paper proposed a hybrid algorithm to improve the performance of person identification in video files. The system works through several steps: first, face detection using Viola-Jones algorithm; second, feature extraction by algorithm local binary pattern (LBP); final, person identification by hybrid proposed algorithm (HPBFF) by hybrid between backpropagation neural network and firefly algorithm. The results show that the system was able to identify and monitor the person with a high classification accuracy rate of 98.4%, compared to 94.7% for the approach without the hybrid. The results of the tests revealed that the system is robust and has a high recognition rate, making it suitable for use in mobile and compact identification and authentication.

TI  - Rental Assistance and a Fresh Start to Spur Criminal Desistance: Evidence From a Pilot Housing Experiment
T2  - CITYSCAPE
AB  - Much of the research literature on prisoner reentry focuses on the importance of individual determinants of reintegration of the formerly incarcerated back into society, such as education, job training, and addiction treatment. Less studied are the consequences of housing and neighborhood context. Still, research shows that the formerly incarcerated tend to have unstable residential patterns, and their places of residence are often in close proximity to the same locations where they got into trouble with the law in the past. This article argues that stable housing, particularly in an environment that provides an opportunity for a fresh start and a separation from past criminal associates, is a crucial foundation for successful prisoner reentry. Evidence in support of this argument is garnered from a pilot housing mobility program called the Maryland Opportunities through Vouchers Experiment, or MOVE, which aimed at lessening the risk of recidivism by using housing subsidies to provide participants with housing in geographic areas some distance from where they lived in the past. This article reports on the outcome of the pilot, including an assessment of the likelihood of rearrest and a qualitative comparison of the post release experiences of treatment and control group participants.

TI  - Feeling the Revolution: The Emotional Regime of Russian Empire's Penitentiaries in the Development of Protest Communication**
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
AB  - This article examines the problem of the special emotional regime of hard labour prisons in the Russian Empire in the early twentieth century in the context of the social construction of emotions characteristic of a revolutionary community. The paper aims to identify the determinants of the success of the revolutionary movement in the events of 1917. The author focuses on the mechanisms of communication of political prisoners and the role of the emotional component in the formation of a stable system of social interaction in a revolutionary environment. Employing the methodology of the history of emotions and comparative analysis, the author studies both previously known historical sources (letters of F. E. Dzerzhinsky) and archival materials (perlustration of letters from prisoners of the Smolensk convict prison) which have not been studied before. The article demonstrates how the special conditions of imprisonment shaped the emotional regime of hard labour prisons and contributed to the formation of a revolutionary community. With classical communication mechanisms limited, prisoners developed alternative means of communication. Also, the author pays special attention to the peculiarities of the written language of political prisoners and its evolution in conditions of hard labour and interaction with the criminal environment. The main results of the study are related to the term "emotional code" as a characteristic communication mechanism ("friend or foe" system) within a revolutionary community. In the context of the social processes of the beginning of the century, the opposition to the growing social melancholy on the part of the revolutionary community stands out. It was not only able to build communication mechanisms that were reliable and closed to external analysis based on similar emotional patterns but also used emotional constructions for agitation and propaganda in the public environment. Specific images of the future and the positive emotions associated with it have become a constructive alternative to the negative phenomena that prevail in the public consciousness during the last years of the empire's existence. The main "weapon" of the revolutionary community in 1917, along with propaganda, was empathy, highly developed emotional intelligence, and the ability to accurately capture the emotions of one's surroundings. The article concludes that labour prisons were "laboratories of emotions" which played a significant role in the crystallisation of the revolutionary community and the formation of its mobilisation potential.

TI  - Unsupervised Learning for Feature Selection: A Proposed Solution for Botnet Detection in 5G Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB  - The world has seen exponential growth in deploying Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In recent years, connected IoT devices have surpassed the number of connected non-IoT devices. The number of IoT devices continues to grow and they are becoming a critical component of the national infrastructure. IoT devices' characteristics and inherent limitations make them attractive targets for hackers and cyber criminals. Botnet attack is one of the serious threats on the Internet today. This article proposes pattern-based feature selection methods as part of a machine learning (ML)-based botnet detection system. Specifically, two methods are proposed: the first is based on the most dominant pattern feature values and the second is based on maximal frequent itemset mining. The proposed feature selection method uses Gini impurity and an unsupervised clustering method to select the most influential features automatically. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods have improved the performance of the detection system. The developed system has a true positive rate of 100% and a false positive rate of 0% for best performing models. In addition, the proposed methods reduce the computational cost of the system as evidenced by the detection speed of the system.

TI  - Harmful Alcohol Use and Associated Socio-Structural Factors among Female Sex Workers Initiating HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Harmful alcohol use is an important risk factor for premature mortality and morbidity and associated with increased HIV risk and lower uptake of and adherence to HIV interventions. This study aimed to assess the extent of harmful alcohol use and associated socio-structural vulnerability factors among female sex workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a key population in the HIV epidemic. Data from a study of female sex workers initiating pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) recruited through respondent driven sampling were used. We assessed harmful alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) defined as having an AUDIT score >= 16. Associations between harmful alcohol use and socio-structural factors were assessed using logistic regression with marginal standardization. Of the 470 women recruited, more than one third (37.3%) had a drinking pattern suggestive of harmful alcohol use. Such use was independently associated with sex work-related mobility (aPR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11-1.61), arrest/incarceration (aPR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.27-1.84) and gender-based violence (aPR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06-1.56). The high prevalence of harmful alcohol use and the interconnectedness with socio-structural factors indicate a need for a holistic programmatic approach to health for female sex workers. Programming should not solely direct attention to individual behavior but also include strategies aiming to address socio-structural vulnerabilities.

TI  - Historicising Australian Deportation of<i> Suspect</i> and<i> Undesirable</i> Migrant Communities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR CRIME JUSTICE AND SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
AB  - The overall aim of the paper is to present evidence on the factors underpinning historical deportation cases, by exploring the reasons, explanations and patterns related to deportation in Australia. The purpose is to consider whether these historical factors are antecedent to current forms of deportation occurring in Australia, and to bring to the fore potential recurring patterns. Deportation is currently conceptualised by border criminologists as a punitive tool of discipline and control, within the realm of penal powers. Some of this work on the 'deportation regime' asserts that certain migrants, or groups of migrants, are undesirable: their identity, (not)belonging and punishment have become inherently intertwined, and their mobility has become politicised and criminalised. This article theorises that deportation has been used in Australia, now and in the past, to expel individuals who are viewed as detrimental to the 'health' of the host society. The 'deportation categories' demonstrate that migrants' desirability has historically been a temporary condition, shifting over time in line with the state's requirements. They also demonstrate the historical regime of criminalisation of undesirable others enacted through Australia's border control regime.

TI  - Mobile Phone Data: A Survey of Techniques, Features, and Applications
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Due to the rapid growth in the use of smartphones, the digital traces (e.g., mobile phone data, call detail records) left by the use of these devices have been widely employed to assess and predict human communication behaviors and mobility patterns in various disciplines and domains, such as urban sensing, epidemiology, public transportation, data protection, and criminology. These digital traces provide significant spatiotemporal (geospatial and time-related) data, revealing people's mobility patterns as well as communication (incoming and outgoing calls) data, revealing people's social networks and interactions. Thus, service providers collect smartphone data by recording the details of every user activity or interaction (e.g., making a phone call, sending a text message, or accessing the internet) done using a smartphone and storing these details on their databases. This paper surveys different methods and approaches for assessing and predicting human communication behaviors and mobility patterns from mobile phone data and differentiates them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. It also gives information about spatial, temporal, and call characteristics that have been extracted from mobile phone data and used to model how people communicate and move. We survey mobile phone data research published between 2013 and 2021 from eight main databases, namely, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, SAGE, Science Direct, Scopus, SpringerLink, and Web of Science. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 148 studies were selected.

TI  - The Effect of COVID-19 Restrictions on Routine Activities and Online Crime
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives Routine activity theory suggests that levels of crime are affected by peoples' activity patterns. Here, we examine if, through their impact on people's on- and off-line activities, COVID-19 restriction affected fraud committed on- and off-line during the pandemic. Our expectation was that levels of online offending would closely follow changes to mobility and online activity-with crime increasing as restrictions were imposed (and online activity increased) and declining as they were relaxed. For doorstep fraud, which has a different opportunity structure, our expectation was that the reverse would be true. Method COVID-19 restrictions systematically disrupted people's activity patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions well-suited to testing the effects of "interventions " on crime. We exploit those conditions using ARIMA time series models and UK data for online shopping fraud, hacking, doorstep fraud, online sales, and mobility to test hypotheses. Doorstep fraud is modelled as a non-equivalent dependent variable, allowing us to test whether findings were selective and in line with theoretical expectations. Results After controlling for other factors, levels of crime committed online were positively associated with monthly variation in online activities and negatively associated with monthly variation in mobility. In contrast, and as expected, monthly variation in doorstep fraud was positively associated with changes in mobility. Conclusions We find evidence consistent with routine activity theory, suggesting that disruptions to people's daily activity patterns affect levels of crime committed both on- and off-line. The theoretical implications of the findings, and the need to develop a better evidence base about what works to reduce online crime, are discussed.

TI  - Starch-based near-infrared organic fluorophores for the imaging of latent fingerprints
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB  - Visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is important in the field of forensic identification and criminal investigation and requires fluorescent materials with near-infrared (NIR) emission to suppress the background fluorescence, with simultaneously high selectivity for fingerprints; however, this remains a challenge. Herein, we rationally designed and prepared a new NIR-emissive composite material composed of an NIR fluorophore, i.e., (E)-4-(7-(4-bromophenyl)imino) methyl)benzo[C][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (BrBTN), and porous starch through a simple grinding method. The BrBTN powder exhibited strong NIR emission with a high quantum yield of 0.209. Porous starch enabled high adsorption ability for fingerprints. Using the BrBTN@starch composite, clear images of the tertiary structure of a fingerprint with NIR emission on various substrates were obtained under 405 nm light excitation within 10 s using a mobile phone alone after a simple dust removal treatment. Benefiting from its strong NIR emission and high selectivity, the imaging resolution of the fingerprint fluorescent patterns based on the NIR composite was 3-times higher than that of commercial fingerprint powder. This work provides a novel strategy for the design of highly emissive NIR fingerprint powder with the advantages of reduced background fluorescence, easy operation, high photostability, low cost and low toxicity to developers, indicating its great potential in the field of trace inspection and biological imaging.

TI  - "Hot street" of crime detection in London borough and lockdown impacts
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB  - In recent years, the police intervention strategy "Hot spots policing" has been effective in combating crimes. However, as cities are under the intense pressure of increasing crime and scarce police resources, police patrols are expected to target more accurately at finer geographic units rather than ballpark "hot spot" areas. This study aims to develop an algorithm using geographic information to detect crime patterns at street level, the so-called "hot street", to further assist the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in capturing crime change and transitive moments efficiently. The algorithm applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique onto street networks, rather than traditional areal units, in one case study borough in London; it then maps the detected crime "hot streets" by crime type. It was found that the algorithm could successfully generate "hot street" maps for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), enabling more effective allocation of police patrolling; and bear enough resilience itself for the Strategic Crime Analysis (SCA) team's sustainable utilization, by either updating the inputs with latest data or modifying the model parameters (i.e. the kernel function, and the range of spillover). Moreover, this study explores contextual characteristics of crime "hot streets" by applying various regression models, in recognition of the best fitted Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, encompassing eight significant contextual factors with their varied effects on crimes at different streets. Having discussed the impact of lockdown on crime rates, it was apparent that the land-use driven mobility change during lockdown was a fundamental reason for changes in crime. Overall, these research findings have provided evidence and practical suggestions for crime prevention to local governors and policy practitioners, through more optimal urban planning (e.g. Low Traffic Neighborhoods), proactive policing (e.g. in the listed top 10 "Hot Streets" of crime), publicizing of laws and regulations, and installations of security infrastructures (e.g. CCTV cameras and traffic signals).

TI  - Household occupancy and burglary: A case study using COVID-19 restrictions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Introduction: In response to COVID-19, governments imposed various restrictions on movement and activities. According to the routine activity perspective, these should alter where crime occurs. For burglary, greater household occupancy should increase guardianship against residential burglaries, particularly during the day considering factors such as working from home. Conversely, there should be less eyes on the street to protect against non-residential burglaries.Methods: In this paper, we test these expectations using a spatio-temporal model with crime and Google Com-munity Mobility data. Results: As expected, burglary declined during the pandemic and restrictions. Different types of burglary were, however, affected differently but largely consistent with theoretical expectation. Residential and attempted residential burglaries both decreased significantly. This was particularly the case during the day for completed residential burglaries. Moreover, while changes were coincident with the timing and relaxation of restrictions, they were better explained by fluctuations in household occupancy. However, while there were significant de-creases in non-residential and attempted non-residential burglary, these did not appear to be related to changes to activity patterns, but rather the lockdown phase.Conclusions: From a theoretical perspective, the results generally provide further support for routine activity perspective. From a practical perspective, they suggest considerations for anticipating future burglary trends.

TI  - Mobility, Nonstationary Density, and Robbery Distribution in the Tourist Metropolis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
AB  - This study looks at the spatial distribution of robbery against residents as a function of nonstationary density and mobility patterns in the most densely populated city in Spain, Barcelona. Based on the geographical coordinates of mobile devices, we computed two measures of density of the ambient population and the tourist presence, for work days, weekends, and holidays in 2019. Negative binomial regressions are then estimated to analyse whether these measures are correlated with the risk of robbery, controlling for land use and the characteristics of the social environment. The model reveals that residents' chances of being exposed to robbery in Barcelona depend on the social relevance and tourism attractiveness of certain places at particular times of the year. Our results disclose two sources of social disorganization as stronger predictors of the occurrence of robbery in Barcelona, respectively linked to structural processes of residential instability and daily and seasonal mobility patterns. On the one hand, we found that the effect of the density of international tourists on the outcome variable is mediated by residential volatility, which is assumed to be associated with housing shortages in neighbourhoods where short-term vacation rentals are widespread. On the other hand, the ability to exert effective social control is significantly undermined in urban areas, where the ambient population and the volume of tourists outnumber the resident population, thus increasing incidents of robbery victimization. The implications of these findings for urban policy and crime prevention in the Catalan capital are discussed.

TI  - The impact of criminal law regulation-based business environment optimization on entrepreneurial spirit and enterprise development
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The purpose is to explore the impact of the business environment optimization by Criminal Law Regulation (CLR) on Entrepreneurial Spirit (ES) and Enterprise Development (ED) and to provide a reference for subsequent related research. Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote "mass entrepreneurship and innovation" and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

TI  - Examining Walking-Waiting Sexual Assaults from Previously Untested Sexual Assault Kits: The intersection of Stranger and Outdoor Sexual Assaults
T2  - VICTIMS & OFFENDERS
AB  - Within a routine activity framework, we explore walking-waiting sexual assaults - committed by strangers when victims were outdoors and did not consensually leave the scene. With data from untested sexual assault kits spanning decades in one urban jurisdiction, we found these were common (a fourth of the sample) with a distinct offending pattern. African American women were identified as the most frequent "targets" due to the use of certain public spaces that appear to lack "capable guardianship." "Motivated offenders" were often serial sexual offenders but not exclusively tied to walking-waiting sexual assaults. Findings improve our understanding of the intersection of stranger and outdoor sexual assaults. Implications and future directions discussed.

TI  - The digitalization of the European migration policy in the context of the securitization of migration
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB  - The objective of the article is to analyze the transformation of information systems for controlling migration flows in the EU in cases where migration becomes a security issue, which intensified after the refugee crisis of 2015-2016. Special attention is paid to the use of big data analytics for forecasting migration. The research methods of the investigation were: the problem-chronological method to trace the evolution of the EU regulatory framework in the field of border control digitalization and an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the possibilities of using big data to forecast migration, with sociological and statistical methods to characterize migration flows. The article is based on the legal, statistical and fact sheets documents of the EU and the UN, and the publications of foreign and Russian researchers on this theme. The author considers the main characteristics and functional features of the Schengen information system and its components, identifies the limitations, highlightes the stages of transformation of the system and indicates the achieved and planned results. During the modification of the system, along with expanding the set of alerts, enhanced access is provided for EU agencies, including the possibility of making searches using fingerprints. A key function of the new system is to ensure the cooperation of nation states for prompt, confidential and efficient follow-up of cases, through the data exchange via a secure network. The author infers that the digital transformation of border control is aimed at creating a European-wide information infrastructure to investigate crimes and terrorist acts, generate alerts about the danger of their commission by "suspicious" persons and highlight groups of "unreliable" people whose stay in the EU is undesirable. At the same time, the target risk group is not limited to terrorists and criminals, but also includes illegal immigrants. In addition to border control information systems, big data analytics is used to monitor and forecast migration. Mobile phone call detail records, social media and Google trends become a leveraged data source to study mobility patterns and create profiles of potential migrants in real-time; the provided big data can also reflect emerging trends and support early warning mechanisms of easier monitoring of migration at national, subnational and local levels. Based on the analysis of the documents, statistical and sociological data, the author concludes that European migration policy has been advanced into a kind of risk management, in which, due to the process of digitalization, it is possible to profile groups of migrants and create series of "risk filters" serving to identify, isolate and deflect those whose presence in the EU should be limited.

TI  - The Political Consequences of Ethnically Targeted Incarceration: Evidence from Japanese American Internment during World War II
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB  - What are the downstream political consequences of state activity explicitly targeting an ethnic minority group? This question is well studied in the comparative context, but less is known about the effects of explicitly racist state activity in liberal democracies such as the United States. We investigate this question by looking at an important event in American history-the incarceration of people of Japanese ancestry during World War II. We find that Japanese Americans who were imprisoned or had family who were imprisoned are significantly less politically engaged and that these patterns of disengagement increase with detention length. Using an identification strategy leveraging quasi-random camp assignment, we also find that camp experience matters: those who went to camps that witnessed intragroup violence or demonstrations experienced sharper declines, suggesting that group fragmentation is an important mechanism of disengagement. Taken together, our findings contribute to a growing literature documenting the demobilizing effects of ethnically targeted detention and expand our understanding of these forces within the United States.

TI  - CPFinder: Finding an unknown caller's profession from anonymized mobile phone data
T2  - DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB  - Identifying an unfamiliar caller's profession is important to protect citizens' personal safety and property. Owing to the limited data protection of various popular online services in some countries, such as taxi hailing and ordering takeouts, many users presently encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. The situation may be aggravated when criminals pretend to be such service delivery staff, threatening the user individuals as well as the society. In addition, numerous people experience excessive digital marketing and fraudulent phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, which does not work for the identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones might exhibit their application preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession-related information. This offers researchers and engineers a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies and regulations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation). We observe that appropriate statistical methods can offer an effective means to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, thus enabling the identification of the types of mobile phone callers without privacy concerns. In this paper, we develop CPFinder -- a system that exploits privacy-preserving mobile data to automatically identify callers who are divided into four categories of users: taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters, and normal users (other professions). Our evaluation of an anonymized dataset of 1,282 users over a period of 3 months in Shanghai City shows that the CPFinder can achieve accuracies of more than 75.0% and 92.4% for multiclass and binary classifications, respectively.

TI  - Patterns of Nighttime Crowd Flows in Tourism Cities Based on Taxi Data-Take Haikou Prefecture as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The study of patterns of crowd flows represents an emerging and expanding research field. The most straightforward and efficient approach to investigate the patterns of crowd flows is to concentrate on traffic flow. However, assessments of simple point-to-point movement frequently lack universal validity, and little research has been conducted on the regularity of nighttime movement. Due to the suspension of public transportation at night, taxi orders are critical in capturing the features of nighttime crowd flows in a tourism city. Using Haikou as an example, this paper proposes a mixed Geogrid Spatio-temporal model (MG-STM) for the tourism city in order to address the challenges. Firstly, by collecting the pick-up/drop-off/in-out flow of crowds, this research uses DCNMF dimensionality reduction to extract semi-supervised spatio-temporal variation features and the K-Means clustering method to determine the cluster types of nighttime crowd flows' changes in each geogrid. Secondly, by constructing a mixed-evaluation model based on LJ1-01 nighttime light data, crowd flows' clusters, and land use data in geogrid-based regions, the pattern of nighttime crowd flows in urban land use areas is successfully determined. The results suggest that MG-STM can estimate changes in the number of collective flows in various regions of Haikou effectively and appropriately. Moreover, population density of land use areas shows a high positive correlation with the lag of crowd flows. Each 5% increase in population density results in a 30-min delay in the peak of crowd flows. The MG-STM will be extremely beneficial in developing and implementing systems for criminal tracking and pandemic prevention.

TI  - Staying Out of Trouble: Criminal Cases Against Russian Mayors
T2  - COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
AB  - Although repression against elites is a common occurrence in authoritarian regimes, we know little about which elites are targeted. This paper uses an original dataset on the prosecution of mayors in large Russian cities to examine the factors that make elites more likely to be arrested. We argue that in electoral authoritarian regimes like Russia, regime leaders are reluctant to arrest popular officials. Such officials command political capital that is useful to the regime, and arrests of prominent officials can produce popular backlash. We examine this argument using an original dataset on all arrests of municipal leaders in Russia's 221 largest cities between 2002 and 2018. We find that mayors who won their elections by large margins are less likely to be arrested. In addition, we document several other substantively important patterns: (1) a mayor's professional background is not related to the likelihood of arrest, (2) opposition mayors are four times more likely to be arrested, and (3) mobilization of votes for the regime is not protective against arrest.

TI  - Cybercrime's tendencies of the teenagers in the COVID-19 era: assessing the influence of mobile games, social networks and religious attitudes
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose The teenager community is the most affected community by cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Increasing social networks and facilitating teenager access to the Internet have increased the probability of cybercrimes. On the other hand, entertainment such as mobile and computer games is top-rated among teenagers. Teenagers' tendency to cybercrime may be influenced by individual, parent, social, economic and political factors. Studying the impact of social networks, mobile games and parents' religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is the primary goal of this paper. Design/methodology/approach The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a considerable change in the world and the lifestyle of all people. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was also affected by the special conditions of this virus. Changes in ICT and rapid access to it have empowered individuals and organizations, and people have increased civic participation and interaction through ICT. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created new challenges for the government and citizens and may cause new crimes. Cybercrime is a type of crime that occurs in a cyber environment. These crimes range from invasions of privacy to crimes in which the offender vaguely paralyzes the macroeconomic. In this research, 265 students of high schools and universities are used for collecting data by utilizing a survey. Measuring actions have been done in all surveys employing a Likert scale. The causal pattern is assessed through a constructional equation modeling procedure to study the scheme's validity and reliability. Findings The outcomes have indicated that social networks have no significant relationship with teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Mobile games have a mild effect on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era, and parents' religious attitudes significantly impact teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications Current research also has some restrictions that must be noticed in assessing the outcomes. First, sample research was selected from high schools and universities in one city. So, the size of the model is small, and the generalization of results is limited. Second, this research may have ignored other variables that affect the tendency of teenagers' to cybercrime. Future researchers intend to investigate the parents' upbringing system's impact on teenager's trend to cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Future research can also examine practical factors such as parental upbringing, attitudes toward technology development and virtual addiction in the COVID-19 era. Originality/value In this study, teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is investigated, and a procedure is applied depending on a practical occasion. This article's offered sample provides a perfect framework for influencing parents' social networks, mobile games and religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era.

TI  - Crime registration and distress calls during COVID-19: two sides of the coin
T2  - POLICING & SOCIETY
AB  - This paper inspects changes in crime trends brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu, India. Using Bayesian structural time-series models, the authors study the changes in two metrics of criminal activity - crime registration and distress calls. In addition to absolute changes, the authors analyse the relative changes in one metric with respect to the other during two stay-at-home orders across six categories of crimes: property offences; offences against the human body; cases of missing persons and unidentified dead bodies; vehicle- and traffic-related offences; crimes against women, children and elders; and emerging crimes. While there was an overall decrease in most types of crime, results show that each category was impacted by restrictions in human mobility in different ways; emerging crimes, in particular, increased significantly during both periods. The crime and call trends exhibited a synchronous pattern with respect to a majority of offences except in the category of crimes against women and missing persons, where a contrary trend of decreasing crime registrations and increasing distress calls was noticed during the partial lockdown period. This finding highlights inherent inadequacies such as under-reporting of crimes by victims and non-registration of crime by the police. Understanding these inadequacies could potentially enhance preparedness leading to improved public service delivery by reordering priorities. Breaking down these trends at a crime-specific level assists law enforcement practitioners in gaining insights on crime motivators and enablers, thus contributing towards more effective crime prevention under ordinary circumstances.

TI  - 2V-Gait: Gait Recognition using 3D LiDAR Robust to Changes in Walking Direction and Measurement Distance
T2  - 2022 IEEE/SICE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SYSTEM INTEGRATION (SII 2022)
CP  - IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)
AB  - Gait recognition, which is a biometric identifier for individual walking patterns, is utilized in many applications, such as criminal investigation and identification systems, because it can be applied at a long distance and requires no explicit cooperation of the subjects. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition, and several methods in previous studies have used depth information captured by RGB-D cameras. However, RGB-D cameras are limited in terms of their measurement distance and are difficult to access outdoors. In recent years, real-time multi-layer 3D LiDAR, which can obtain 3D range images of a target at ranges of over 100 m, has attracted significant attention for use in autonomous mobile robots, serving as eyes for obstacles detection and navigation. Compared with cameras, such 3D LiDAR has rarely been used for biometrics owing to its low spatial resolution. However, considering the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, such as the robustness of the illumination conditions, long measurement distances, and wide-angle scanning, the approach has the potential to be applied outdoors as a biometric identifier. The present paper describes a gait recognition system, called 2V-Gait, which is robust to variations in the walking direction of a subject and the distance measured from the 3D LiDAR. To improve the performance of gait recognition, we leverage the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, which are not included in regular cameras. Extensive experiments on our dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - An Advanced Integrated Approach in Mobile Forensic Investigation
T2  - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB  - Rapid advancement of digital technology has encouraged its use in all aspects of life, including the workplace, education, and leisure. As technology advances, so does the number of users, which leads to an increase in criminal activity and demand for a cyber-crime investigation. Mobile phones have been the epicenter of illegal activity in recent years. Sensitive information is transferred due to numerous technical applications available at one's fingertips, which play an essential part in cyber-crime attacks in the mobile environment. Mobile forensic is a technique of recovering or retrieving digital evidence from mobile devices so that it may be submitted in court for legal procedures. As a result, mobile phone data is essential for obtaining evidence in elements of mobile forensic data analysis. So, in this paper, we offer a method for detecting suspect drug-dealing patterns in mobile devices utilizing forensic and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Machine Learning algorithms are used to uncover the pattern in an original dataset, and performance measurements are used to assess the suggested system. In our approach, Logistic Regression (LR) manifests 95% of the highest accuracy in terms of count vector whereas, the BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) also achieved 95% of accuracy in terms of TFIDF.

T2  - 2022 IEEE/CVF WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION WORKSHOPS (WACVW 2022)
CP  - 22nd IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)
AB  - Iris recognition of living individuals is a mature biometric modality that has been adopted globally from governmental ID programs, border crossing, voter registration and de-duplication, to unlocking mobile phones. On the other hand, the possibility of recognizing deceased subjects with their iris patterns has emerged recently. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning-based method for postmortem iris segmentation and recognition with a special visualization technique intended to support forensic human examiners in their efforts. The proposed postmortem iris segmentation approach outperforms the state of the art and - in addition to iris annulus, as in case of classical iris segmentation methods - detects abnormal regions caused by eye decomposition processes, such as furrows or irregular specular highlights present on the drying and wrinkling cornea. The method was trained and validated with data acquired from 171 cadavers, kept in mortuary conditions, and tested on subject-disjoint data acquired from 259 deceased subjects. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of data used in postmortem iris recognition research to date. The source code of the proposed method are offered with the paper. The test data will be available through the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) archives.

Among these methods, biometric facial recognition is particularly effective because it is adaptable and non-intrusive. Face recognition has grown in popularity due to its numerous uses in entertainment, smart cards, information security, law enforcement, and surveillance. It is a vital topic in pattern recognition, computer vision, and image processing. For feature extraction, two basic methods are used: appearance-based and model-based. Methods based on appearance employ global Face identification using representations. Model-based face approaches seek to create a human face model that captures facial diversity. The distance between the vectors of two photographs is defined as image similarity. This research primarily analyzed open-source Face Recognition algorithms based on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) model. The study will be of significant consideration in integrating Face Recognition technology on the current Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) using Minutiae Structure.

TI  - Sex Differences in the Amount and Patterns of Car-Driving Exposure in Spain, 2014 to 2017: An Application of a Quasi-Induced Exposure Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - We designed a cross-sectional study in Spain, from 2014 to 2017. Our objective was to assess sex-related differences in the amount of driving exposure of car drivers, overall and stratified by the main environment-related driving conditions. We compared the sex distribution across three populations: (1) total number of person-years aged > 18 years; (2) total number of person-years aged > 18 years holding a valid car-driving license; and (3) total number of non-responsible car drivers involved in crashes with another offending driver, stratified by different environmental variables. The quasi-induced exposure approach was applied: the non-responsible drivers were considered as representative of the entire population of drivers on the road at the place and time at which the crash occurred. We calculated the female-to-male odds ratio (OR) by comparing population 2 versus 1, and population 3 versus 2. Finally, we performed separate regression models in population 3 for each environment-related variable as the dependent variable and driver's age and sex as the independent variables. The female-to-male OR for the first comparison was 1.12, but values below 1 were found for extreme age groups. In the second comparison, an OR of 0.50 (0.49-0.51) was found, with progressively lower OR values as age increased. In population 3, women were found to drive less than men in environments known to be high risk (i.e., open roads, night-time, poor light conditions, and weekends). A significant gender gap exists in the amount and type of driving exposure. Although women obtain a driving license more frequently than men, they drive much less and tend to avoid high-risk environments. These results emphasize the need to incorporate a gender perspective in the development and implementation of road safety interventions.

TI  - Analysis of Crime Pattern using Data Mining Techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - The advancement in Information Technology permits high volume of data to be generated in databases of institutions, organizations, government, including Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). Technologies have also been developed to store and manipulate these data to enhance decision making. Crime remains a severe threat to humanity. Criminals currently, exploit highly sophisticated technologies to perform criminal activities. To effectively combat crime, LEAs must be adequately equipped with technological tools such as data mining technology to enable useful discoveries from databases. To achieve this, a Real-time Integrated Crime Information System (RICIS) was developed and mobile phones were used by informants (general public) to capture information about crimes being committed within Southern-East, Nigeria. Each crime information captured is being sent to the LEA responsible for the crime type and the information is stored in the agency database for data analysis. Thus, this study uses data mining algorithms to analyze crime trends and patterns in Southern-Eastern part of Nigeria between 2012 and 2013. The algorithms adopted were Classification and Rule Induction. The data set of 973 were collected from Eleme Police station, PortHarcourt (2012) and Nsukka Police station (2013). The analysis enables identifications of some trends of crimes and criminal activities from various LEAs databases, enhancing crime control and public safety.

TI  - Introduction to the Special Issue: Urban Mobility and Crime Patterns
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
AB  - This Special Issue is a collection of seven papers that seek to better our understanding of how urban mobility relates to crime patterns, and how day to day movement of people in urban spaces (urban mobility) is related to spatio-temporal patterns of crime. It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both 'crime type' appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the 'dynamic denominator' challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation. This special issue explores a range of potential solutions to this including mobile/cell phone data, transportation data, land use data, and other possible measures to address this.

TI  - Static or dynamic? Characterize and forecast the evolution of urban crime distribution
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Despite the considerable deployed resources, current policing efforts are failing to stop crimes before they start, and therefore, also failing to adequately protect lives and property. To promote the intelligent transformation from reactive to proactive policing, this study proposed a hierarchical crime prediction framework. First, the temporal dependency in the frequency domain was decomposed and a network constructed to capture the spatial relationships within the sub-frequencies. Human mobility in a city was then utilized to characterize the dynamic relationships within the network. Using the proposed framework, this study examined the crime distribution evolution in Chicago to holistically predict the short-term crimes in the different communities. The framework was found to have high predictive accuracy and significant potential in promoting proactive policing. It was concluded that: (1) as the crime distribution evolution comes from the spatial relationship changes, these dynamic relationships are critical in explaining and characterizing the evolution; and (2) the social interactions constructed using the human activity data can characterize the dynamic crime distribution relationships.

TI  - Migration Control, the Local Economy and Violence in the Burkina Faso and Niger Borderland
T2  - JOURNAL OF BORDERLANDS STUDIES
AB  - The externalized European "migration management" in West Africa has technologically modernized and militarized border posts. This threatens visa-free travel, freedom of settlement and borderland economies in parts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It has interrupted historical mobility patterns, depleted the diversity of mobility practices and criminalized regional economies. At the same time, one can observe intensified and asymmetrical violent conflict in some of these borderlands. By taking the Kantchari-Makalondi borderland as a case study we analysed the relations between migration policies, insecurity, forced immobility and economic decline. Our observations and interviews with migrants, traders, security forces and borderlanders lead us to question conventional narratives on border control and African mobilities as a binary relation between Africa and Europe. Instead, they foreground the multiple practices of (im)mobility in these spaces: the circulation and blockage of travelers, merchandise, surveillance technologies, and military interventions and their impact on security and livelihoods.

TI  - Deep Learning Approaches for Continuous Authentication Based on Activity Patterns Using Mobile Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Smartphones as ubiquitous gadgets are rapidly becoming more intelligent and context-aware as sensing, networking, and processing capabilities advance. These devices provide users with a comprehensive platform to undertake activities such as socializing, communicating, sending and receiving e-mails, and storing and accessing personal data at any time and from any location. Nowadays, smartphones are used to store a multitude of private and sensitive data including bank account information, personal identifiers, account passwords and credit card information. Many users remain permanently signed in and, as a result, their mobile devices are vulnerable to security and privacy risks through assaults by criminals. Passcodes, PINs, pattern locks, facial verification, and fingerprint scans are all susceptible to various assaults including smudge attacks, side-channel attacks, and shoulder-surfing attacks. To solve these issues, this research introduces a new continuous authentication framework called DeepAuthen, which identifies smartphone users based on their physical activity patterns as measured by the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors on their smartphone. We conducted a series of tests on user authentication using several deep learning classifiers, including our proposed deep learning network termed DeepConvLSTM on the three benchmark datasets UCI-HAR, WISDM-HARB and HMOG. Results demonstrated that combining various motion sensor data obtained the highest accuracy and energy efficiency ratio (EER) values for binary classification. We also conducted a thorough examination of the continuous authentication outcomes, and the results supported the efficacy of our framework.

TI  - Inequality, information failures, and air pollution
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Research spanning several disciplines has repeatedly documented disproportionate pollution exposure in low-income communities and communities of color. Among the various proposed causes of this pattern, those that have received the most attention are income inequality, dis-crimination, and firm costs (of inputs and regulatory compliance). We argue that an additional channel - information - is likely to play an important role in generating disparities in pollution exposure. We present multiple reasons for a tendency to underestimate pollution burdens. Using a model of housing choice, we then derive conditions under which "hidden"pollution leads to an inequality - even when all households face the same lack of information. This inequality arises when households sort according to known pollution and other disamenities, which we show are positively correlated with hidden pollution. To help bridge the gap between environmental justice and economics, we discuss the relationship between hidden information and three different distributional measures: exposure to pollution; exposure to hidden pollution; and welfare loss due to hidden pollution.

TI  - Fintech, base of the pyramid entrepreneurs and social value creation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Purpose Fintech is having a profound impact in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because it offers more financial inclusion. In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of Fintech, base of the pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the SSA context. Design/methodology/approach The current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources. The authors interviewed respondents from the Sierra Leone Fintech Association and four BOP entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. Findings The authors find that Fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. FinTech also offers growth possibilities for BOP entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. At the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing BOP entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development. Research limitations/implications This study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between BOP entrepreneurship, social value creation and Fintech. For example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like Fintech. However, in a country like Sierra Leone, which has experienced both a civil war and Ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by BOP inhabitants. Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on Fintech's application in BOP contexts. Practical implications A key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits. Fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. Fintech offers BOP entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating Fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more BOP entrepreneurs using these services. Social implications The authors find that at the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of BOP consumers who interact with case firms. Originality/value This paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on BOP entrepreneurship and social value creation by Fintech services in an SSA context. It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's Fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or Fintech firms. Finally, there is a specific focus on BOP entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship.

TI  - The Professional Market of International Criminal Justice Divisions of Labour and Patterns of Elite Reproduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - This article analyses the division of labour and patterns of elite reproduction that characterize international criminal justice as a market of services. Using a sociological framework and building on empirical data on 996 professional agents, the analysis outlines how the market in and around the international criminal courts is structured by three different social groups that dominate the formal roles of judges, prosecutors and defence counsel. The article investigates the relative positionality of these groups highlighting the low degree of mobility between them. It also demonstrates the reproduction of male, global north professionals at the top of these groups, pointing towards intersectional dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in this market. To deepen the analysis of divisions of labour and reproduction of status, the article turns to a closer analysis of the patterns of expertise upon which elite status is built and how it links the three groups to the wider market of international criminal justice. The relations between the identified social groups, the elite of which have very particular characteristics dominated by global north professionals, educations and networks, structure a core part of the market of international criminal justice and formats the social fault lines behind its normative debates.

TI  - The impact of strict measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on the spatial pattern of the demand for police: case study Antwerp (Belgium)
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - COVID-19 impacts the daily lives of millions of people. This radical change in our daily activities affected many aspects of life, but acted as well as a natural experiment for research into the spatial distribution of 911 calls. We analyse the impact of the COVID-19 measures on the spatial pattern of police interventions. Crime is not uniformly distributed across street segments, but how does COVID-19 affect these spatial patterns? To this end, Gini coefficients are calculated and a proportion differences spatial point pattern test is applied to compare the similarity of the patterns of incidents before, during, and after the first lockdown in Antwerp, Belgium. With only essential mobility being allowed, the emergency call pattern has not significantly changed before, during or after this lockdown, however, a qualitative shift in police officer's daily work may have had an effect on the daily operation of the Antwerp police force.

TI  - International Survey on the Use of Emerging Technologies Among Forensic and Correctional Mental Health Professionals
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Although the global diffusion of e-mental health has increased in recent years, research on the use of technologies in criminal justice settings is limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted an international online survey (N = 555) of forensic and correctional mental health professionals from Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and 20 additional countries. Telecommunication technologies and mental health platforms had the highest numbers of users, the broadest scope, and the largest increase in use due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In contrast, the use of social media and advanced technologies was lower, narrower in scope, and remained the same or decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents' age, professional discipline, country, and clinical setting significantly predicted total technology use in clinical practice. The study findings provide an overview of the current patterns of technology use and point to opportunities for research and development.

TI  - Mapping Workplace Neighborhood Mobility Among Sex Workers in an Urban Canadian Setting: Results of a Community-Based Spatial Epidemiological Study From 2010-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Mobility among sex workers has been linked not only to improved economic and social opportunities, but also to concerns regarding displacement, criminalization, and violence. In 2014, new "end-demand" legislation criminalized new aspects of sex work in Canada (e.g., third-party advertising, purchasing) while leaving the sale of sex legal. Utilizing data from a longitudinal community-based cohort of women sex workers in Metro Vancouver (An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access [AESHA], 2010-2016), we used kernel density mapping to understand and identify geographic patterns of workplace neighborhood mobility (i.e., changing the primary neighborhood in which one worked in the last 6 months); multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was also used to model contextual (policing, violence, and safety) and individual correlates of workplace mobility among sex workers over the 6-year period, including potential changes in mobility patterns pre- and post-end-demand criminalization. A total of 543 sex workers were included in analyses, contributing 2,199 observations. A total of 402 (74.0%) experienced workplace neighborhood mobility during the study period. Neighborhood mobility was negatively correlated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98/year older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.97, 0.99]) and positively correlated with homelessness (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = [1.12, 1.82]), identifying as a gender/sexual minority (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.70]), and servicing clients primarily outdoors (vs. informal indoor or in-call venues; AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = [1.21, 1.81]); police harassment (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI = [0.96, 1.48], p = .11) and changing one's neighborhood of work due to safety concerns (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = [0.94, 2.00], p = .09) were both marginally correlated. Steps to promote safer working conditions for marginalized women in urban environments remain urgently needed, including shifts away from criminalized enforcement toward community-led initiatives and promoting access to safer indoor workspaces.

TI  - Photojournalism, prostitution and sexual citizenship: hegemonic and emerging chronotopes [2013-2018]
T2  - ADCOMUNICA-REVISTA CIENTIFICA DE ESTRATEGIAS TENDENCIAS E INNOVACION EN COMMUNICACION
AB  - This article reflects on how photojournalism works as a device with the ability to configure subjectivities. It also analyzes the way in which visual representations of prostitution in media intervene in the articulation of sexual citizenship. This research carries out a semiotic analysis of the images about prostitution published in Spanish national, regional and local digital media between 2013 and 2018. A longitudinal reading of a corpus of approximately 1000 images was made in order to trace the hegemonic visual patterns, as well as to identify emerging modes of representation which might be displacing the conventional imageries, which nowadays participate in the controversy about this social problem. Photojournalism tends to use chronotopic images, which condense the stories and their ideological spectrum by using repetitive scenes, mainly related to street prostitution as well as the institutional, police and judicial actions (such as public statements, raids, trials, among others). Along with conventional patterns, new agents and modes of representation are emerging right now, especially those associated to the sex work movement. Changes in relation to the status and role of the prostitution's client are also being undertaken. The strategies of hypervisibility, depersonalization, criminalization, and hypersexualization support different ways of looking: a panoptic look - both police focus and welfare focus (paternalistic) - and a pornographic look. Imaginaries and photographic representations mobilize and enable subject positions, activate dynamics of recognition with which social, political and sexual boundaries are negotiated between decent citizens and sexual dissidents.

TI  - Homelessness on public transit: A review of problems and responses
T2  - TRANSPORT REVIEWS
AB  - More than half a million people in the U.S. experience homelessness every day. Lacking other options, many turn to transit vehicles, stops, and stations for shelter. Many also ride public transit to reach various destinations. With affordable housing scarce and the numbers of unhoused individuals often surpassing the capacities of existing safety nets and support systems, transit operators face homelessness as a pressing issue on their systems and must implement policy measures from other realms beyond transportation to address it. Because of the health and safety implications for transit of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated further rise in homelessness from the resulting economic downturn, studying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable travelers is critical. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify articles discussing homelessness in transit systems. While only a handful of articles exist from the 1990s, there is an emerging literature in the last 20 years that examines different aspects of homelessness in transit systems. We identify and review 63 articles on homelessness in transit systems and other public settings to better understand the extent of homelessness in the U.S., and how transit agencies perceive its impacts. We also summarise literature findings on the travel patterns of unsheltered individuals, which show that public transit represents an important and common mode of travel for them. Lastly, we focus on responses to homelessness from the part of transit operators. We find two types of responses: 1) punitive, in which criminalisation, policing and enforcement of laws and codes of conduct prevail, and 2) outreach-related, which aim towards providing help and support to unsheltered individuals. We conclude by summarising our findings as well as the existing gaps in the literature.

TI  - The impact of fear on young people's mobility
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study makes use of a dataset recently collected among young people in Stockholm, Sweden (N = 1122), to investigate the impact of fear on young people's mobility and precautionary behaviour, after controlling for previous victimization as well as situational characteristics of daily trips. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and logistic regression models underlie the methodology of the study. Previous victimization, especially for sexual crimes, triggers precautionary behaviour among young people using trains and the metro. Signs of poorly maintained transit environments also affect young riders' mobility patterns, as they state that they avoid particular stations or routes at particular times. Informed by principles of environmental criminology and the theory of fear of crime, the implications of the findings for both theory and practice are discussed.

TI  - Uncovering Abnormal Behavior Patterns from Mobility Trajectories
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Using personal trajectory information to grasp the spatiotemporal laws of dangerous activities to curb the occurrence of criminal acts is a new opportunity and method for security prevention and control. This paper proposes a novel method to discover abnormal behaviors and judge abnormal behavior patterns using mobility trajectory data. Abnormal behavior trajectory refers to the behavior trajectory whose temporal and spatial characteristics are different from normal behavior, and it is an important clue to discover dangerous behavior. Abnormal patterns are the behavior patterns summarized based on the regular characteristics of criminals' activities, including wandering, scouting, random walk, and trailing. This paper examines the abnormal behavior patterns based on mobility trajectories. A Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)-based method is used to extract personal trajectory features, and the K-means clustering method is applied to extract abnormal trajectories from the trajectory dataset. Based on the characteristics of different abnormal behaviors, the spatio-temporal feature matching method is used to identify the abnormal patterns based on the filtered abnormal trajectories. Experimental results showed that the trajectory-based abnormal behavior discovery method can realize a rapid discovery of abnormal trajectories and effective judgment of abnormal behavior patterns.

TI  - CrimAnalyzer: Understanding Crime Patterns in Sao Paulo
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB  - Sao Paulo is the largest city in South America, with crime rates that reflect its size. The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion, revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data. The experiments show the capability of CrimAnalyzer in identifying crime-related phenomena.

TI  - Outcome of Endoscope-Assisted Microvascular Decompression in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm Caused by Severe Indentation of the Brain Stem at the Pontomedullary Sulcus by the Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery
T2  - OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the most effective treatment option for hemifacial spasm (HFS). However, deeply located forms of compression would require proper identification to allow for adequate decompression.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the usefulness of endoscopic visualization in one of the most challenging compression patterns in HFS, where the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) loop is severely indenting the brain stem at the proximal root exit zone of facial nerve along the pontomedullary sulcus.
   METHODS: Radiological and operative data were checked for all patients in whom severe indentation of the brainstem by PICA at pontomedullary sulcus was recorded and endoscope-assisted MVD was performed. Clinical correlation and outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 58 patients with HFS were identified with radiological and surgical evidence proving brainstem indentation at the VII transitional zone. In 31 patients, PICA was the offending vessel to the facial nerve. In 3 patients, the PICA loop was mobilized under visualization of a 45. endoscope. A total of 31 patients had a mean follow-up duration of 52.1 mo. The mean duration between start of complaints and surgery was 7.2 yr. In the last follow-up, all patients had remarkable spasm improvement. A total of 5 patients had more than 90% disappearance of spasms and 26 patients experienced spasm-free outcome.
   CONCLUSION: Although severe indentation of brain stem implies morphological damage, outcome after MVD is excellent. A 45. endoscope is extremely helpful to identify compression down at the pontomedullary sulcus. Deeply located compression site can easily be missed with microscopic inspection alone.

TI  - Subway Station Closures and Robbery Hot Spots in New York City-Understanding Mobility Factors and Crime Reduction
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
AB  - This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment involving subway station closures to examine how subway ridership is associated with the impact of robbery victimization within spatial network buffers immediately surrounding subway stations in Bronx (County), New York. The New York City subway system is the busiest in the USA, with an annual ridership estimated at 1.8 billion people. Key findings of this research include noteworthy relationships between robbery hot spots and subway stations, as well as substantial reductions in robbery frequency during temporary subway station closures, with larger reductions occurring in closer proximities to the subway stations. There was also a significant robbery pattern "normalization process" that occurred after the closed subway stations were reopened where robbery frequency returned to historically "normal" pre-closure levels. These notable decreases of crime in and around subway stations during the station closure time periods, as well as the prominent increases in robbery when subway stations reopened, should be taken into consideration when planning transit maintenance, conducting crime prevention initiatives, and scheduling crime control strategies.

TI  - Information technology in the investigation of riots
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY-LAW-VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO
AB  - The use of information technology is a cross-cutting actively developing element in the method of investigating mass riots, which in modern conditions acts as a factor in the success of this work. The article reveals the features of the criminal prosecution of riots using information technology. The main areas of using automated data banks and information retrieval systems in the investigation of mass riots are determined. Domestic and foreign possibilities of using information technologies in the organization of investigative work, in accounting and control over the materials of criminal cases on mass riots, in fixing the circumstances of crimes and in proving them are shown. The structure of the program for making and supporting the decision to create a specialized investigative group designed to work in emergency conditions is determined. As part of such a group, it is proposed to immediately organize its own information center with its own databank of episodes and persons, taking into account the primary materials on the facts of riots using the programs intended for this. For the formation of information about the general situation of mass riots, special mathematical models for the study of space-time patterns are intended. Recommendations are formulated to survey a large area and recreate a unified picture of disturbances using quadcopters. To determine the involvement of a person in riots, it is recommended to compare data from various electronic sources, such as email correspondence, electronic documents and mobile communication log files, the history of search queries in web browsers, cards and payment systems, etc. The modern judicial practice of proving participation in mass riots using, along with photo and video materials, the corresponding fragments of records also placed in electronic means is assessed.

TI  - Navigating Seas, Markets, and Sovereignties: Fishers and Occupational Slippage in the South China Sea
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
AB  - Oceans have always been arenas of crime, drugs and human trafficking, and poaching. When such violations occur on fishing boats, they fall under the rubric of "fisheries crime." Political scientists and economists have tended to assume that these criminal fishers simply abandon their legal occupation and take up illegal practices, labelled "transnational organized fisheries crime" by the United Nations. On the other hand, some scholars have also argued that subsidized and militarized fishers in the South China Sea are simply acting as instruments of their states' geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations, non-enforcement of regulations, and incentives. Such present-centric approaches both obscure the modalities of fishers' embodied skills and knowledge and their motivations, and downplay the inter-ethnic networks that connected different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting the spike in maritime trespass in (and out of) the South China Sea, this article combines ethnography and historiography to show how fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader, smuggler, and militia. I propose the concept of occupational slippage as a way of going beyond the fiction of fishing as mono-occupational and theorizing the realities of fishers as mobile maritime actors who enact and conceal multiple-simultaneous and consecutive-livelihood strategies while navigating not just seas, but also markets and territorial sovereignties. Thus, I argue that the fishers' practices reflect wider interconnections between modern, state-supported, and technology-driven fisheries with older pre-nation-state patterns of mobility and knowledge accumulated through generations, producing new forms of versatility that operate under the states' radars.

TI  - A Holistic Framework for Crime Prevention, Response, and Analysis With Emphasis on Women Safety Using Technology and Societal Participation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Ensuring women's safety in smart cities is a need of the hour. Even though several legal and technological steps are adopted worldwide, women's safety continues to be an international concern. Criminal records are maintained by law enforcement agencies and are most often not available to the public in an easily comprehensible form. While some wearable devices and mobile applications are available which are touted to aid in ensuring women's safety, they utilize limited societal intervention and are not very efficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. Most often the crime response, crime analysis, and crime prevention schemes are not integrated, leading to gaps in ensuring women's safety. Our major contribution is in developing a holistic system encompassing the three crucial aspects, i.e crime analysis and mapping, crime prevention, and emergency response by leveraging societal participation for women safety management. This work applies the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the identification of hotspots and patterns of crime. The proposed system uses data generated from the mobile application and/or wearable gadget prototyped as a part of this work along with the criminal history records for crime response, analysis, and prevention. The system for the hotspot identification is demonstrated for the Pilani town in the Jhunjhunu district in the state of Rajasthan, India, and can be easily scaled up geographically and utilized as a safety strategy for smart cities. While the common man is provided a cost-effective solution via the developed mobile application or wearable gadget, the various components are integrated into a website for supervisory management and can be utilized by law enforcement agencies.

T2  - IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC 2021)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)
AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) refers to classifying trajectories into the corresponding generated users and has emerged as an essential spatio-temporal data mining task with a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from personalized location recommendation and trip planning to criminal behavior detection and object tracking. Despite the progress made by recent deep learning-based human mobility learning models, some critical factors related to personal context and user-location interactions have not yet been fully explored. Besides, existing works suffer from high computational cost issues due to the increased complexity of trajectory learning and contextual location embedding. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end model called GNNTUL, composed of a graph neural network (GNN) module and a classifier, to effectively and efficiently learn human mobility and associate the traces to the users in online social networks. GNNTUL is the first GNN-based human mobility learning model exploiting implicit transition patterns behind sparse user traces in online social networks while extracting users' unique motion features and discriminating the motion traces. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNNTUL over several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both linking accuracy and learning efficiency.

TI  - Vulnerable Masculinities? Gender Identity Construction among Young Undocumented Sikh Migrants in Paris
T2  - RELIGIONS
AB  - This paper discusses the impact of immigration policies on the ways young undocumented Sikh migrants in Paris negotiate their masculinity. The current criminalization of labor migration from the global South in Europe is disrupting long established patterns of upward mobility through international migration, that entailed remitting money home, getting married and reuniting with one's family in the host country and moving up the socio-professional ladder from low-paid jobs to self employment. Instead, the life of an increasing number of Sikh migrants in France and elsewhere is marked by irregular status and socio-economic vulnerability. In this context, undocumented Sikh migrants try to assert their gender identity in multiple ways, characterized by homosociality, the importance of manual labor, specific forms of male sociability marked by the cultivation of their body, while remaining firmly grounded in a Sikh/Panjabi religious universe through seva (voluntary service) and gurdwara attendance.

TI  - Eye Contact During Live Social Interaction in Incarcerated Psychopathic Offenders
T2  - PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Psychopathy is characterized by a lack of empathy, callousness, and a range of severe antisocial behaviors. A deficit to accurately process social cues, which has been widely documented in psychopathic populations, is assumed to underlie their pathological development. Impaired attention to socially salient cues, such as the eyes of an interaction partner, is a possible mechanism compromising the development of social cognition. Preliminary evidence from static facial stimuli suggests that psychopathy is indeed linked to reduced eye gaze. However, no study to date has investigated whether these mechanisms apply to naturalistic interactions. This study is the first to examine patterns of visual attention during live social interactions and their association with symptom clusters of psychopathy. Eye contact was assessed in a sample of incarcerated offenders (N = 30) during semistructured face-to-face interactions with a mobile eye-tracking headset and analyzed using a novel automated areas of interest (e.g., eye region) labeling technique. The interactions included an exchange on neutral predetermined topics and included a condition in which the participants were active (talking) and passive (listening). The data reveal that across both listening and talking conditions higher affective psychopathy is a significant predictor of reduced eye contact (listening: r = -.39; talking: r = -.43). The present findings are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy. This study is the first to document these deficits in naturalistic, live social interaction and therefore provides important evidence for their relevance to real-life behavior.

TI  - Environmental and land defenders: Global patterns and determinants of repression
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Environmental and land defenders play a crucial role in attempts to slow down environmental change and address power inequalities in land-use and resource development. Yet, they frequently face repression, including defamation, criminalization, and assassination. Recent policy and media coverage initiatives have provided much needed attention to the protection and support of defenders, but there has so far been little systematic analysis of patterns and determinants of repression at multiple scales. Here, we use databases providing the best available worldwide record of cases of socio-environmental conflicts and killings of defenders to identify patterns of repression and potential determinants of killings. Globally, about a third of socio-environmental conflicts involve mass mobilization, arrests and direct forms of violence. These 'high intensity' conflicts are more frequent in Asia and Latin America. At least 1734 killings of environmental and land defenders took place in a total of 53 countries between 2002 and 2018, most of them occurring in Brazil, the Philippines, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Peru. Our multivariate analysis indicates that major country-level determinants of killings include income level, foreign direct investment, dependency on mineral extraction, regime type, frequency of protest movements, and size of Indigenous populations. We suggest that more systematic reporting and analysis of repression - including through subnational level studies for which we provide testable hypotheses - can help protect and support defenders, notably through conflict-sensitive investment policies and greater accountability for abuses.

TI  - Block-Level Analysis of the Attractors of Robbery in a Downtown Area
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - This article examines the predictions of crime pattern theory in a unique neighborhood type. It tested potential crime attracting facilities against street robbery data from 2009 to 2013 in the Police Districts I & II in Downtown Houston. The analysis modeled the four daily human routine periods described in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Generalized linear simultaneous negative binomial regression model was used to determine the size of the influence of the variables (beta coefficients) and their significance for each model outcome. The findings show some distinct patterns of street robbery due to the immediate and lagged effects of the variables relatable to the study environment's unique setting. Two variables, geographic mobility, and barbershops were particularly significant across three of the outcome models. The results suggest that the physical and social structure of neighborhoods determined by land-use regulations would enhance understanding of the time-based influence on robbery patterns due to crime-attracting facilities.

TI  - A machine learning forensics technique to detect post-processing in digital videos
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB  - Technology has brought great benefits to human beings and has served to improve the quality of life and carry out great discoveries. However, its use can also involve many risks. Examples include mobile devices, digital cameras and video surveillance cameras, which offer excellent performance and generate a large number of images and video. These files are generally shared on social platforms and are exposed to any manipulation, compromising their authenticity and integrity. In a legal process, a manipulated video can provide the necessary elements to accuse an innocent person of a crime or to exempt a guilty person from criminal acts. Therefore, it is essential to create robust forensic methods, which will strengthen the justice administration systems and thus make fair decisions. This paper presents a novel forensic technique to detect the post-processing of digital videos with MP4, MOV and 3GP formats. Concretely, detect the social platform and editing program used to execute possible manipulation attacks. The proposed method is focused on supervised machine learning techniques. To achieve our goal, we take advantage that the social platforms and editing programs, execute filtering and compression processes on the videos when they are shared or manipulated. The result of these transformations leaves a characteristic pattern in the videos that allow us to detect the social platform or editing program efficiently. Three phases are involved in the method: 1) Dataset preparation; 2) data features extraction; 3) Supervised model creation. To evaluate the scalability of the technique in real scenarios, we used a robust, heterogeneous and far superior dataset than that used in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mobile-Enhanced Prevention Support Study for Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender Women Leaving Jail: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, particularly those who have experienced criminal justice involvement, have particularly high HIV burdens, and a majority of those in jail have substance use disorders (SUDs). MSM and transgender women also experience elevated rates of incarceration. Once community re-entry occurs, individuals are in a critical period for addressing potential risks of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition and negative sequelae of substance use. Further, the impact experienced by one's social and sexual networks experienced at the time of detention and release have important health implications for MSM and transgender women.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to test a new intervention-Mobile-Enhanced Prevention Support (MEPS)-that involves a GPS-based mobile app called GeoPassport (referred to as GeoPass in practice), incentives, and peer support for promoting HIV prevention, substance use treatment, and use of related services.
   Methods: A two-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial will seek to enroll 300 HIV-negative MSM and transgender women, aged 18-49 years, with SUDs, who are either in jail or have recently left jail. Participants will be enrolled by study staff and randomized to the MEPS intervention group or usual care group. The intervention group will receive customized wellness goals in addition to GeoPass, cash incentives, and the support of a trained peer mentor for 6 months. Data collection will consist of a baseline survey and three follow-up surveys at 3, 6, and 9 months postenrollment, either in person or by phone or videoconference when necessary. The primary outcomes include establishing a primary care provider; being prescribed and adhering to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV; screening for HIV, STIs, and hepatitis C virus; and engagement in recommended treatment for SUDs. Secondary outcomes include obtaining treatment for any identified infections and avoiding recidivism.
   Results: Enrollment began in November 2019 and study completion is expected in 2023.
   Conclusions: This study will advance our knowledge base on patient navigation and peer mentor interventions. Peer navigation services have been studied for the treatment of HIV, but less often in the context of HIV and STI prevention among sexual and gender minority populations at the time of re-entry into the community from jail. The MEPS study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of combining peer mentor services with a mobile app to facilitate service utilization and participant-peer mentor communication. MEPS will assess patterns of PrEP uptake and utilization in MSM and transgender women leaving jail. The study will provide heretofore unavailable data from persons leaving jail regarding HIV PrEP, STI screening, substance abuse treatment, and service utilization patterns and experiences, including geocoded data for those in the intervention arm.

TI  - Gender, Family, and the Policing of the 'Criminal Tribes' in Nineteenth-Century North India
T2  - MODERN ASIAN STUDIES
AB  - In the South Asian setting, the fields of gender history and family history are still predominantly concerned with relatively elite social groups. Few studies have examined issues of gender and the family in the history of Dalit, low-caste, and socially marginalized communities, especially those that were labelled 'criminal tribes' from the mid-nineteenth century on. This article explores the ways in which gender patterned criminalized communities' experiences of everyday colonial governance under Part I of the 1871 Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) in the first two decades that it was enforced in northern India. In this early period, the colonial government did not closely regulate marriage practices, domestic arrangements, or the gendered organization of labour within communities categorized as 'criminal tribes'. Nevertheless, notions of sexuality and gender underlay colonial knowledge of the 'criminal tribes', which emerged in dialogue with middle-class Indian gender and caste politics. Moreover, the family unit was the central target of the CTA surveillance and policing regime, which aimed to produce 'industrious' families. Officially endorsed forms of labour had complex implications for criminalized communities in the context of North Indian gender norms and strategies of social mobility. Gender power dynamics also shaped criminalized peoples' interpersonal, embodied interactions with British and Indian colonial officials on an everyday basis. Meanwhile, different forms of leverage and evasion were open to men and women to cope with their criminalization and so the colonial state was experienced in highly gendered ways.

TI  - Simulating spatial crime patterns: What do we learn in standard ecological studies of crime?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Objectives: Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us?
   Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets.
   Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably.
   Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level.

TI  - Forensic genetics and the prediction of race: What is the problem?
T2  - BIOSOCIETIES
AB  - A new wave of innovations in forensics seeks to support criminal investigations by making inferences about the racial or ethnic appearance of as yet unknown suspects using genetic markers of phenotype or ancestry. This paper argues that to grasp fully the potentials of these innovations they must be understood both in the context of established patterns of police-minority relations and as part of significant changes in the use of 'race' as an object of knowledge in science, policy, and politics. Socio-technical developments offer new means of identification through geneticisation, datafication, and visualisation and heighten the visibility and valorisation of racial difference. Elements of this are already evident in existing national police forensic DNA databases whose operation, outcomes, and accompanying ethical frames are racialised in varied ways. By openly mobilising race and ethnicity, however, predictive techniques raise new questions about the validity, interpretation, dissemination, and application of results. Examination of existing use by the police and public of suspect descriptions shows the enduring power of common sense visual and linguistic understandings of race and appearance. That very power makes it hard to transition effectively from moments of collective stigmatisation to the identification of individual suspects.

TI  - Improved real-time permission based malware detection and clustering approach using model independent pruning
T2  - IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB  - The popularity of Android prompts cyber-criminals to create malicious apps that can compromise security and confidentiality of the mobile systems. Analysing the permissions requested by an app is one of the methods to detect if it is malware or not. However, taking all the permissions available in the Android system into account can result in a model with increased complexity. To tackle this, a malware detection system is needed as both efficient and employable for real-time usage. In this study, a preprocessing module has been developed that comprises of five different data reduction techniques to identify the minimal set of permission. The preprocessing resulted in a ten-dimensional vector in place of 113 permissions. It is also observed that the performance of a decision tree trained just with these ten dimensions is as the one trained with all 113 permissions. The proposed malware detection system achieves an accuracy of 94.3% on unknown malware samples. The system outperforms others in terms of recall attributed to lower false negative prediction. Further, it categorises the malware samples into 45 families using a clustering approach. An android application has also been developed using a built model for real-time usage.

TI  - The Lords of War: violence, governance and nation-building in north-western Greece
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF HISTORY-REVUE EUROPEENNE D HISTOIRE
AB  - The article explores the intersection between paramilitary mobilization and nation-building in the area of Thesprotia in north-western Greece. It does so by examining the activities of the right-wing paramilitaries of EDES (Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Sindesmos - National Republican Greek League) between the Axis occupation and the early Cold War period. Studies of nation-building in twentieth-century Europe have adopted a state-centric approach. More recent scholarship has questioned this approach and presented a more nuanced picture of the nation-making process. A significant strand of this scholarship discusses the role of non-state armed actors - bandits, paramilitaries and criminal gangs - in this process. The present article contributes to this literature by focusing on an aspect of paramilitarism that has largely been overlooked in the existing scholarship: governance. The article discusses patterns of paramilitary governance and explores the impact of wartime rule in local institutions and civilian security, as well as the political legacies of paramilitarism.

TI  - Socio-economic, built environment, and mobility conditions associated with crime: a study of multiple cities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Nowadays, 23% of the world population lives in multi-million cities. In these metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Seminal studies analyse crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large in a single city. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how violent and property crimes are related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods. To that end, we analyse crime at small areas and integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces to compare how the different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogota, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another. Thus there is clearly no "one fits all" model.

TI  - The Influence of Intra-Daily Activities and Settings upon Weekday Violent Crime in Public Spaces in Manchester, UK
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
AB  - People ebb and flow across the city. The spatial and temporal patterning of crime is, in part, reflective of this mobility, of the scale of the population present in any given setting at a particular time. It is also a function of capacity of this population to perform an active role as anoffender,victim or guardianin any specific crime type, itself shaped by the time-variant activities undertaken in, and the qualities of, particular settings. To this end, this paper explores the intra-daily influence of activities and settings upon the weekday spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public spaces. This task is achieved through integrating a transient population dataset with travel survey, point-of-interest and recorded crime data in a study of Great Manchester (UK). The research deploys a negative binomial regression model controlling for spatial lag effects. It finds strong and independent, but time-variant, associations between leisure activities, leisure settings and the spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public space. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings.

TI  - The Importance of Space and Time in Aggravated Assault Victimization
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Interpersonal crimes such as aggravated assault greatly impacts upon an individuals' sense of personal safety and security as the crime results in a physical injury. Understanding where and when aggravated assaults are most likely to occur is therefore vital to minimize the victimization risk associated with this crime. The main aim of this study is to explore the relative importance of space and time in aggravated assault victimization. This was done using national level aggravated assault data (2008-2010) obtained from New Zealand Police and census data from Statistics New Zealand. Both the spatial and temporal distribution of aggravated assault are outlined to examine their association with aggravated assault victimization. Aggravated assault is found to cluster in space but not in time. The relationships between aggravated assault risk in space and time and a suite of social, economic, and lifestyle variables was then examined. A clear socioeconomic gradient was found between aggravated assault risk by space and all neighborhood characteristics with high-risk neighborhoods having greater residential mobility and ethnic/racial diversity, as well as being more deprived, having higher rates of unemployment, and lower median household incomes. No clear pattern emerged between aggravated assault by time and the selected neighborhood characteristics. The policy implications of these findings in terms of policing and diversity conclude.

TI  - Authentication and integrity of smartphone videos through multimedia container structure analysis
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB  - Nowadays, mobile devices have become the natural substitute for the digital camera, as they capture everyday situations easily and quickly, encouraging users to express themselves through images and videos. These videos can be shared across different platforms exposing them to any kind of intentional manipulation by criminals who are aware of the weaknesses of forensic techniques to accuse an innocent person or exonerate a guilty person in a judicial process. Commonly, manufacturers do not comply 100% with the specifications of the standards for the creation of videos. Also, videos shared on social networks, and instant messaging applications go through filtering and compression processes to reduce their size, facilitate their transfer, and optimize storage on their platforms. The omission of specifications and results of transformations carried out by the platforms embed a features pattern in the multimedia container of the videos. These patterns make it possible to distinguish the brand of the device that generated the video, social network, and instant messaging application that was used for the transfer. Research in recent years has focused on the analysis of AVI containers and tiny video datasets. This work presents a novel technique to detect possible attacks against MP4, MOV, and 3GP format videos that affect their integrity and authenticity. The method is based on the analysis of the structure of video containers generated by mobile devices and their behavior when shared through social networks, instant messaging applications, or manipulated by editing programs. The objectives of the proposal are to verify the integrity of videos, identify the source of acquisition and distinguish between original and manipulated videos. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The 'Exposed' Population, Violent Crime in Public Space and the Night-time Economy in Manchester, UK
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
AB  - The daily rhythms of the city, the ebb and flow of people undertaking routines activities, inform the spatial and temporal patterning of crime. Being able to capture citizen mobility and delineate a crime-specific population denominator is a vital prerequisite of the endeavour to both explain and address crime. This paper introduces the concept of anexposedpopulation-at-risk, defined as the mix of residents and non-residentswho may play an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in a specific crime type, present in a spatial unit at a given time. This definition is deployed to determine the exposed population-at-risk for violent crime, associated with the night-time economy, in public spaces. Through integrating census data with mobile phone data and utilising fine-grained temporal and spatial violent crime data, the paper demonstrates the value of deploying an exposed (over an ambient) population-at-risk denominator to determine violent crime in public space hotspots on Saturday nights in Greater Manchester (UK). In doing so, the paper illuminates that as violent crime in public space rises, over the course of a Saturday evening, the exposed population-at-risk falls, implying a shifting propensity of the exposed population-at-risk to perform active roles as offenders, victims and/or guardians. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and policy relevance of these findings.

TI  - Ambient Population and Larceny-Theft: A Spatial Analysis Using Mobile Phone Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - In the spatial analysis of crime, the residential population has been a conventional measure of the population at risk. Recent studies suggest that the ambient population is a useful alternative measure of the population at risk that can better capture the activity patterns of a population. However, current studies are limited by the availability of high precision demographic characteristics, such as social activities and the origins of residents. In this research, we use spatially referenced mobile phone data to measure the size and activity patterns of various types of ambient population, and further investigate the link between urban larceny-theft and population with multiple demographic and activity characteristics. A series of crime attractors, generators, and detractors are also considered in the analysis to account for the spatial variation of crime opportunities. The major findings based on a negative binomial model are three-fold. (1) The size of the non-local population and people's social regularity calculated from mobile phone big data significantly correlate with the spatial variation of larceny-theft. (2) Crime attractors, generators, and detractors, measured by five types of Points of Interest (POIs), significantly depict the criminality of places and impact opportunities for crime. (3) Higher levels of nighttime light are associated with increased levels of larceny-theft. The results have practical implications for linking the ambient population to crime, and the insights are informative for several theories of crime and crime prevention efforts.

T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB  - Advances in both telecommunications and Information technology have improved the way users do business online. Android, an open-source mobile operating system, is becoming an attractive target for cyber criminals to exploit due to its predefined permission model. Without classification, the mobile operating system permits installation of mobile applications of all kinds, including Trojans, thus making its trustworthiness into question. In this paper, we present a security system called collaborative policy-based security scheme (CSS) that permits users to customize the access permissions of Android applications during runtime. The proposed CSS security scheme validates the trustworthiness of each application before being installed. The experimental results show that the proposed CSS successfully detects all malicious applications with a run-time overhead of 2.7%.

T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Although evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities, transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies, emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting.

T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB  - Telephony technologies (mobile, VoIP, and fixed) have potentially improved the way we communicate in our daily life and have been widely adopted for business and personal communications. At the same time, scammers, criminals, and fraudsters have also find the telephony network an attractive and affordable medium to target end-users with the advertisement, marketing of legal and illegal products, and bombard them with the huge volume of unwanted calls. These calls would not only trick call recipients into disclosing their private information such as credit card numbers, PIN code which can be used for financial fraud but also causes a lot of displeasure because of continuous ringing. The fraudsters, political campaigners can also use telephony systems to spread malicious information (hate political or religious messages) in real-time through audio or text messages, which have serious political and social consequences if malicious callers are not mitigated in a quick time. In this context, the identification of malicious callers would not only minimize telephony fraud but would also bring peace to the lives of individuals. One way to classifies users as a spammer or legitimate is to get feedback from the call recipients about their recent interactions with the caller, but these systems not only bring inconvenience to callees but also require changes in the system design. The call detail records extensively log the activities of users and can be used to categorize them as the spammer and non-spammer. In this paper, we utilize the information from the call detailed records and proposed a spam detection framework for the telephone network that identifies malicious callers by utilizing the social behavioral features of users within the network. To this extent, we first model the behavior of the users as the directed social graph and then analyze different features of the social graph i.e. the Relationship Network and Call patterns of users towards their peers. We then used these features along with the decision tree to classify callers into three classes i.e. human, spammer and call center. We analyzed the call record data-set consisting of more than 2 million users. We have conducted a detailed evaluation of our framework which demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving acceptable detection accuracy and extremely low false-positive rate. The performance results show that the spammers and call center numbers not only have a large number of non-repetitive calls but also have a large number of short duration calls. Similarly, on the other hand, the legitimate callers have a good number of repetitive calls and most of them interacted for a relatively long duration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Novel Method of Spatiotemporal Dynamic Geo-Visualization of Criminal Data, Applied to Command and Control Centers for Public Safety
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - This article shows a novel geo-visualization method of dynamic spatiotemporal data that allows mobility and concentration of criminal activity to be study. The method was developed using, only and significantly, real data of Santiago de Cali (Colombia), collected by the Colombian National Police (PONAL). This method constitutes a tool that allows criminal influx to be analyzed by concentration, zone, time slot and date. In addition to the field experience of police commanders, it allows patterns of criminal activity to be detected, thereby enabling a better distribution and management of police resources allocated to crime deterrence, prevention and control. Additionally, it may be applied to the concepts of safe city and smart city of the PONAL within the architecture of Command and Control System (C2S) of Command and Control Centers for Public Safety. Furthermore, it contributes to a better situational awareness and improves the future projection, agility, efficiency and decision-making processes of police officers, which are all essential for fulfillment of police missions against crime. Finally, this was developed using an open source software, it can be adapted to any other city, be used with real-time data and be implemented, if necessary, with the geographic software of any other C2S.

TI  - Legal Consciousness and Cultural Capital
T2  - LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW
AB  - In this article, we use a Bourdieusian framework to theorize the relationship between cultural capital and legal consciousness, and in turn to consider how variation in legal consciousness contributes to the creation and maintenance of legal hegemony. We investigate how cultural capital shapes the ways people navigate situations that force them to mediate between state-conferred rights, on one hand, and requests from state authority, on the other. Specifically, we analyze open-ended responses to a series of vignettes about constitutional rights in the criminal procedure context. We find that high cultural capital gives rise to a greater sense of self-efficacy in police-citizen interactions. This finding parallels the literature on the influence of cultural capital in the education context and may point to a more general pattern of self-advocacy within the juridical field. People with high cultural capital also evince a more salient sense of entitlement, understanding their own needs and desires as paramount. The social processes we identify may make people with limited cultural capital more vulnerable to investigative authority, and thus more susceptible to arrest and prosecution. Even if knowledge of a right and the opportunity to assert that right are equally distributed, meaningful access to that right remains inequitable.

TI  - Urban Mobility and Activity Space
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY, VOL 46
AB  - Recent theoretical and methodological advances in urban sociology, including spatially located data, provide new opportunities to consider the joint influence of mobility and place in urban social life. This review defines the concept of activity space, describes its origins in urban sociology, and examines the extent to which activity space approaches advance sociological research in four substantive domains-spatial inequality and segregation, social connectedness and engagement, crime and offending patterns, and health and health-related behavior. It next describes the evolution of methods for location tracking and new approaches that hold promise for maximizing urban mobility and activity space contributions. It then discusses how location data may be augmented to enhance our sociological understanding of the structure, meaning, and implications of the places people visit or traverse in daily life. We close with new directions for activity space research, emphasizing how such work could enable comparative contextual research.

TI  - Towards A New Approach to Identify WhatsApp Messages
T2  - 2020 IEEE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRUST, SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS (TRUSTCOM 2020)
CP  - 19th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (IEEE TrustCom)
AB  - Today traditional communication methods, such as SMS or phone calls, are used less often and are replaced by the use of chat applications. WhatsApp is one of the most popular chat applications nowadays. WhatsApp offers different ways of communicating, which include sending text messages and making phone calls. The implementation of encryption makes WhatsApp more challenging for law enforcement agencies to identify when a suspect is sending or receiving messages via this chat application. Most research in literature focused on the analysis of WhatsApp data by obtaining information from a physical device, such as a seized mobile device. However, it is not always possible to extract the data needed from a mobile device for the analysis of the WhatsApp data because of the encryption, or no devices have been seized yet. In addition, the current techniques for real time analysis of WhatsApp messages show that there is a high risk of detection by the suspect. Alternative methods are needed to understand the communication patterns of a suspect and criminal organizations. In this paper, we focused on identifying when a suspect is receiving or sending WhatsApp messages using only wiretap data. Therefore, no seized devices are needed. The pattern analysis has been used to identify patterns of data sent to and received from the WhatsApp servers. The identified patterns were tested against a large dataset created with different mobile devices to determine if the patterns are consistent. By using the technique described in this paper, investigators will obtain more information if and with whom a suspect is communicating.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFLUENCE 2020: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLOUD COMPUTING, DATA SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
CP  - 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science and Engineering (Confluence)
AB  - The ability of modern smartphones to provide us with real time location-based data is one of its most important features. Being able to predict a person's future location based on the real time location data would be the next step in utilizing this functionality. Using this functionality, combined with machine learning one's probable destination can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy. People don't always use map-based navigation for the places they visit every day, like their work place or school and there may be significant traffic on the regular route taken, however, if our device knows where we're headed, it can warn us beforehand and help us reroute. This functionality can also be used by cops to determine the future location of a criminal fleeing a crime scene.
   These features and functionalities can be implemented through various machine learning algorithms which are compared to determine the most accurate one. The proposed system can predict a user's future location using the current location and time, learning from the user's previously visited locations.

TI  - CONSTRUCTING SUSPICION THROUGH FORENSIC DNA DATABASES IN THE EU. THE VIEWS OF THE PRUM PROFESSIONALS
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This article explores the fluid and flexible forms of constructing suspicion, which take shape in transnational governance of crime through forensic DNA databases. The empirical examples are the views of professionals engaged with the so-called Prum system. This technological identification system was developed to enable DNA data exchange across EU Member States in the context of police and judicial cooperation to control cross-border crime and terrorism. We argue that suspicion is constructed through forms of deterritorializing and reterritorializing assumptions about criminality linked to the movements of suspect communities across the European Union. Transnational crime management is configured through narratives of global expansion of criminal mobility, technical neutrality of DNA identification and the reliance on criminal categorizations of particular national populations.

TI  - A Study of Use of Mobile Phone for Marketing Purpose by Fishermen of the Indus Delta
T2  - MEDIA EDUCATION-MEDIAOBRAZOVANIE
AB  - The research about the role of mobile phone in different parts of the world shows that the fishing community is also increasingly adopting mobile phone and it is resulting in a more efficient fish market and reduction in uncertainty.
   The mobile phone is resulting in greater market integration and improvement in the quality of life of fishermen. Moreover, the mobile phone has also been helpful in connecting isolated fishermen communities to mainstream society and disaster risk reduction during the emergency. Similarly, the mobile phone is also playing an important role in helping the ordinary fishermen to get connected with the market and the device is emerging as a highly useful source of essential market information for fishermen communities. Purpose of the study: This article is based on an impact assessment study regarding mobile phone use by fishers of the Indus Delta for the marketing of their fish products. It also envisages the impact of socio-demographic factors on the usage of mobile phones by the fishing communities for better marketing of their output from the fisheries profession. Due to the increasing importance of mobile phones in creating market efficiency in rural markets all around the world, a study was conducted to investigate the impact of mobile on fish marketing in the deltaic region of Sindh Pakistan. Methodology: The data was accumulated by a cross-sectional survey. The data collection instrument was a close-ended questionnaire, and SPSS software was used to analyze the data. Main Findings: It was observed that the majority of the respondents acknowledged the role of mobile phone for receiving market information. That includes enquiring about fish prices, information about dealer buyer, and suitable market to sell their fish products. Applications of this study: this study will be helpful for the government to make policies to facilitate and improve the profession of fisheries for the fisher community in Pakistan. Novelty: This is the first systematic and scientific study to be conducted upon the fishermen of Indus Delta and their mobile usage pattern for fish production marketing purposes.

TI  - Targeted: The Mobilizing Effect of Perceptions of Unfair Policing Practices
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB  - Criminal justice contact is increasingly routine for Americans, and preemptive policing tactics render contact a feature of everyday life for minorities and the poor. Scholars interested in the impact of criminal justice contact on political outcomes largely find that all types of contact decrease voting and trust in government. Yet, qualitative evidence suggests that sometimes individuals are mobilized by their experiences. I leverage theoretical differences between custodial citizenship and having a loved one who is a custodial citizen, referred to as proximal contact, to identify the conditions under which criminal justice experiences catalyze political action. Individuals with proximal contact face fewer barriers to participation than do custodial citizens, and when they view negative experiences as a product of a system that targets people like them on the basis of group affiliation, contact can spur participation in activities other than voting.

TI  - Discovery of Chasing Patterns in Trajectory Data
T2  - DATABASE SYSTEMS FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS, DASFAA 2020
CP  - 25th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA)
AB  - Trajectory data contains abundant temporal and spatial information of moving objects. By calculating and analyzing trajectory data, behavior patterns of mobile objects can be found. Among these behavior patterns the discovery of chasing patterns is interesting which will provide effective services for intelligent urban traffic management, criminal investigation, environmental monitoring and other application fields. However, existing chasing pattern discovery methods only compare the local similarity of trajectories, and do not consider the potential significance of stay points or change in speed. This article proposes a new algorithm for chasing pattern discovery based on the stay point detection technology. An optimized stay point detection algorithm is also designed to improve the distance calculation method. The algorithms were evaluated with real and simulation trajectory data and achieved very good results which have higher accuracy and recall rate compared with the existing chasing pattern discovery algorithms.

TI  - Identifying unfamiliar callers' professions from privacy-preserving mobile phone data
T2  - 2020 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILITY, SENSING AND NETWORKING (MSN 2020)
CP  - 16th IEEE International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN)
AB  - Identifying an unfamiliar caller's profession is important to protect citizens' personal safety and property. Due to limited data protection of many popular online services in some countries such as taxi hailing or takeouts ordering, many users encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. This may aggravate the situation that criminals pretend to be delivery staff or taxi drivers, bringing threats to the society. Additionally, many people nowadays suffer from excessive digital marketing and fraud phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, and do not work for identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones which may show their Apps preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession related information. This offers us a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies or regulations (e.g. GDPR 71). Using appropriate statistical methods to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, provides a way to identify mobile phone callers without privacy concern. In this paper, we exploit privacy-preserving mobile data to develop a model which can automatically identify the callers who are divided into four categories of users: normal users (other professions), taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters. The validation results over an anonymized dataset of 1,282 users with a period of 3 months in Shanghai City prove that the proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 75+%.

T2  - CCS '20: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 ACM SIGSAC CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY
CP  - ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS)
AB  - Fake base station (FBS) has been exploited by criminals to attack mobile users by spamming fraudulent messages for over a decade. Despite that prior work has proposed several techniques to mitigate this issue, FBS spam is still a long-standing challenging issue in some countries, such as China, and causes billions of dollars of financial loss every year. Therefore, understanding and exploring the thematic strategies in the FBS spam ecosystem at a large scale would improve the defense mechanisms.
   In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of FBS spam ecosystem by collecting three-month real-world FBS detection results. First, at "macro-level", we uncover the characteristics of FBS spammers, including their business categories, temporal patterns and spatial patterns. Second, at "micro-level", we investigate how FBS ecosystem is organized and how fraudulent messages are constructed by campaigns to trap users and evade detection. Collectively, the results expand our understanding of the FBS spam ecosystem and provide new insights into improved mitigation mechanisms for the security community.

TI  - Anomalous Telecom Customer Behavior Detection and Clustering Analysis Based on ISPs Operating Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Mobile networks and smart phones have become ubiquitous in our daily life. Large amount of customer related telecom data from various sources are generated every day, from which diversified behavior patterns can be revealed, including some anomalous behaviors that are vicious. It becomes increasingly important to achieve both efficient and effective customer behavior analysis based on the telecom big data. In this paper, the Multi-faceted Telecom Customer Behavior Analysis (MTCBA) framework for anomalous telecom customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is proposed. In this framework, we further design the hierarchical Locality Sensitive Hashing-Local Outlier Factor (hierarchical LSH-LOF) scheme for suspicious customer detection, and the Autoencoders with Factorization Machines (FM-AE) structure for dimension reduction to achieve more efficient clustering. Hierarchical LSH-LOF is an improved algorithm of LOF, in which we design a hierarchical LSH process that selects the approximate k nearest neighbors from coarse to fine by gradually narrowing down the scope. Experiments show its superiority over KD-tree w.r.t searching speed. FM-AE exploits Factorization Machines for learning second order feature interactions, which we prove to be useful by designing comparative experiments with five dimension reduction algorithms. With the proposed MTCBA framework, efficient and effective telecom customer behavior analysis including anomalous customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is performed on the real world telecom operating data provided by one of the major Internet service providers (ISPs) in China. Meanwhile, interpretable clustering results of six clusters are obtained to provide valuable information for the precision marketing of telecom operators, criminal combating, and social credit system construction.

TI  - The Spillover Effect of Geotagged Tweets as a Measure of Ambient Population for Theft Crime
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - As a measurement of the residential population, the Census population ignores the mobility of the people. This weakness may be alleviated by the use of ambient population, derived from social media data such as tweets. This research aims to examine the degree in which geotagged tweets, in contrast to the Census population, can explain crime. In addition, the mobility of Twitter users suggests that tweets as the ambient population may have a spillover effect on the neighboring areas. Based on a yearlong geotagged tweets dataset, negative binomial regression models are used to test the impact of tweets derived ambient population, as well as its possible spillover effect on theft crimes. Results show: (1) Tweets count is a viable replacement of the Census population for spatial theft pattern analysis; (2) tweets count as a measure of the ambient population shows a significant spillover effect on thefts, while such spillover effect does not exist for the Census population; (3) the combination of tweets and its spatial lag outperforms the Census population in theft crime analyses. Therefore, the spillover effect of the tweets derived ambient population should be considered in future crime analyses. This finding may be applicable to other social media data as well.

TI  - Indefinite stuckness: Listening in a time of hyper-incarceration and border entrapment
T2  - PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY
AB  - New technologies for recording, reproducing, and disseminating sound are increasingly accessible and provide important opportunities for listening to accounts of confinement. Through a politics and practice of 'earwitnessing detention', this article explores experiential patterns and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By 'tuning in' to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of 'indefinite stuckness'. Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity for respite from the 'chaos' outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies indefinite stuckness.

TI  - Moving into an urban drug scene among people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada: Latent class growth analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Urban drug scenes are characterized by high prevalence of illicit drug dealing and use, violence and poverty, much of which is driven by the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) and the associated stigma. Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter `mobility') among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD.
   Methods
   Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group.
   Results
   In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES.

TI  - An Analysis of Mobility Patterns in Sexual Homicide
T2  - HOMICIDE STUDIES
AB  - This article-based on a national data set (N = 173)-focuses on extrafamilial sexual homicides and their spatial mobility. The study combines the location of the crime scene and the offenders and victims' residences in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the homicides fall within the categories of offender mobility and total mobility. Our results show the validity of the distance decay function, with over 70% of homicides occurring within 10 km of the offender's residence. It appears that under certain circumstances, sexual murderers perceive their surroundings as a safe place to commit a homicide. Finally, the study proposes a four-category spatial typology of sexual homicide.

TI  - Exploring the Implications of Culturally Relevant Teaching: Toward a Pedagogy of Liberation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY
AB  - Schools in America may provide opportunities for upward mobility while also perpetuating social inequality. The inequities found in the US public school system probably result in such a highly stratified society. Conditions found in many schools and classrooms are often a microcosm of the same conditions and factors present in the broader American society. Scholars and education reform activists often use the term school-to-prison pipeline to describe what they view as a widespread pattern in the United States of pushing students, especially those who are already at a disadvantage, out of school, and into the criminal justice system. This research explored whether mentorship in the lives of these very students can affect the trajectory that these students take in life by moving toward a pedagogy of liberation that challenges the inequities and contradictions in the institution of education. Building from a model similar to CDF Freedom Schools, but targeting academic enrichment, Farrah and her colleague Hope developed the Sankofa Project at Yin Elementary School (YES). Embracing both the social-emotional and pedagogical aspects of CDF Freedom Schools, the Sankofa Project moved from a mission that sought to instill a love for reading to actually teaching children to read. This aspect was pivotally important to Farrah and Hope as they sought to dismantle the "cradle to prison pipeline," the concept of funneling masses of people into marginalized lives, imprisonment, and often premature death. Farrah believed that all her predecessors had done "was spot on, but academic enrichment was a key to steering children away from the pipeline." With the rebirth of a caste-like system in America, black and brown bodies are disproportionately locked behind bars, relegated permanent second-class status if declared a felon and an increasingly common trend toward annihilation at the hands of those of who are designated to serve and protect them.

TI  - Analyzing person-exposure patterns in lone-actor terrorism Implications for threat assessment and intelligence gathering
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - Research Summary The lone-actor terrorist population can be extremely heterogeneous and difficult to detect. Intelligence is vital to countering this threat. We devise a typology of person-exposure patterns (PEPs) that could serve as a framework for intelligence gathering and threat assessment. We use cluster analysis and a risk analysis framework (RAF) to identify relations among three components: propensity, situation, and network. The results of the analysis reveal four PEPs: solitary, susceptible, situational, and selection. The solitary PEP lacks common indicators of a propensity to pursue terrorist action. The susceptible PEP reveals cognitive susceptibility, manifesting as mental illness, to be a key factor in the emergence of a terrorist propensity. The situational PEP demonstrates how situational stressors may act as warnings of acceleration toward violent action. Lastly, the selection PEP demonstrates higher frequencies of leakage and antecedent violent behaviors.
   Policy Implications Our findings have two key policy implications. First, given the multifinality of terrorism risk indicators, we suggest a move toward a structured-professional judgement approach to the risk analysis of lone-actor terrorists. Second, we present the PEP typology as a framework for intelligence gathering. Existing frameworks are predominantly focused on mobilization indicators. We suggest expanding data collection to include propensity and situational indicators, as operationalized here, and using the PEP typology to inform decisions about the emergence of the motivation to commit an attack. To do so, it is necessary to pursue a multiagency approach to intelligence gathering.

TI  - The Mobility Crime Triangle for Sexual Offenders and the Role of Individual and Environmental Factors
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - This study-based on a national data set (N = 1,447)-focuses on extrafamilial sexual assaults and their mobility. Spatial information about the offender's house, the victim's house, and the crime scene was combined in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the assaults fall in the categories of total mobility (42.78%) and offender mobility (33.10%). Our results also show the validity of the distance decay function with over 50% of aggressions occurring within 3 km of the offender's house. The analysis did not reveal the existence of buffer zones, probably due to the acquaintance between some of the offenders and their victims. The evidence suggests that environmental risk factors are more significant than individual ones when it comes to explaining the variation among mobility patterns in sexual assaults. Offenders appear to adapt their mobility patterns and modus operandi according to the environmental constraints. Often, offenders choose their own or their victim's house as a safe environment for performed sexual assault.

TI  - A Test of Time-constraint Predictions on Residence-to-Crime Distances among Sex Offenders
T2  - VICTIMS & OFFENDERS
AB  - The finding that offenders tend to commit crime within relative proximity to their own residence has been well established in nearly 80 years of research. The usefulness of this area of research extends not only to the validation of environmental crime theories, but also offers to improve crime analysis capabilities, police investigative practice, and ultimately crime case clearances. Despite the considerable attention this area of study has received, much remains to be known about the factors which might influence variation in residence-to-crime (RTC) distances. One somewhat recently formalized idea is that offenders might be limited by the time that they have in which to commit crimes (such as by employment or family demands) and that this will constrict the geographic mobility of offenders as they operate within those time constraints. This study tested this time-constraint hypothesis on a sample of sex offense incidents (N = 157) from the state of New Jersey. Findings revealed limited support for the time-constraint thesis, before and after controlling for offender, situational and geographic characteristics. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

TI  - The Rational Foraging Terrorist: Analysing the Distances Travelled to Commit Terrorist Violence
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB  - This paper applies the distance-to-crime approach to the case of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and shooting attacks conducted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) during the Northern Ireland conflict, 1970-1998. The aim is to (a) measure the typical 'distance to crime' (b) detect whether a distance-decay effect is noticeable and (c) investigate whether there is a discernible difference in the distance traveled depending upon individual offender characteristics or aspects of how the offence was committed. In particular, it highlights that many of the same dynamics that influence offender decision making within the volume crime world, also apply within the terrorism realm. Five findings stand out in particular. First, a distance decay effect is identifiable. Second, younger offenders travel significantly smaller distances. Third, complex attacks typically involve greater distances. Fourth, our results show the ability of leading decision-makers within PIRA to impact upon the day-to-day operations of the field operatives. Together the results reinforce the argument that when we focus on terrorism from a preventative angle, we should focus on their behaviors: what they do rather than remain preoccupied with concerns about who they are and/or what they might be like. Collectively the results also highlight the fact that for a finer-grained understanding of terrorist behavior we need to disaggregate on a number of levels: within the cadre of operatives, across terrorist attacks, across targets and within conflicts.

TI  - To initiate the conversation - Public health nurses' experiences of working with obesity in persons with mobility disability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim Developing a theory explaining how public health nurses accomplish and adapt counselling in lifestyle habits to decrease obesity in people with mobility disability. Design Empirical research - qualitative. Method Classic grounded theory with face-to-face interviews, 2017-2018, using inductive approach to understand public health nurses' intervening experiences with obesity patients. Results To initiate the conversation emerged as the main concern meaning having difficulties initiating conversations about obesity with patients. Public health nurses' facilitators to communicate lifestyle changes emerged as the pattern generating the theory, which consists of the categories; person-centeredness in the situation, experience and knowledge, strengthening conditions, access to other professionals and prioritization in everyday work. Conclusions Public health nurses hesitate to raise topics of obesity in patients with mobility disability. They advocate increased integration with lifestyle changes in everyday work including multi-professional cooperation. The implication is testing the emerged theory at primary health care centres. Impact Obesity is more common in people with mobility disability than in those without. There is a need to understand how public health nurses adapt counselling in lifestyle habits. Public health nurses hesitate to talk about obesity with patients in fear of offending anyone. Public health nurses did not distinguish between patients with or without mobility disability. Several facilitators could be helpful initiating conversation with the patients. Public health nurses need more time and resources to facilitate conversation with patients with mobility disability to counsel lifestyle changes.

TI  - The Political Consequences of Policing: Evidence from New York City
T2  - POLITICAL BEHAVIOR
AB  - This paper explores the effect that municipal policing can exert on politics, and specifically investigates the effect that Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) policing has had on voter turnout and candidate choice in New York City. While extant studies of the American criminal justice system have found that mass incarceration and felon disenfranchisement negatively impact political participation and engagement, few have explicitly explored policing's relationship with politics and fewer still consider its mobilizing potential. Mobilizing data from over 2.7million geo-coded police stops and data from a series of national and municipal elections this paper uncovers a pattern of voter demobilization, voter mobilization, and candidate choice that cannot be anticipated from extant studies in the literature. Specifically, it finds that while concentrated policing was associated with reductions in voter turnout in the 2006 and 2010 midterm elections, it was associated with higher rates of turnout in the 2008 presidential election and 2013 Democratic primary and general mayor. Further analysis demonstrates that stopping intensity was strongly associated with candidate choice in the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary, such that higher rates of policing were positively associated with support for the candidate (John Liu) who advocated for eliminating SQF and less support for the candidate (William Thompson) who supported SQF. Together, these findings highlight the impact that policing can exert on political behavior, characterize the impact that harmful policing policies can play in instigating policing participation and engagement, and foreground the importance of considering local criminal justice policy and political action.

TI  - Place after prison: Neighborhood attainment and attachment during reentry
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS
AB  - More than 600,000 people leave prison and become residents of neighborhoods across the United States annually. Using a longitudinal survey of people returning to Greater Boston, this study examines disparities in neighborhood attainment after prison. Accounting for levels of pre-prison neighborhood disadvantage, Black and Hispanic respondents moved into significantly more disadvantaged areas than Whites. Neighborhood residence was not attained by all: One-quarter of respondents left prison and entered formal institutional settings or lived in extreme social marginality throughout Boston. Neighborhood attachment was patterned by criminal justice involvement and experiences of material hardship in the year after prison. Findings indicate that housing insecurity, re-incarceration, and profound racial disparities in neighborhood context explain the ecological structure of social inequality in urban neighborhoods in an era of mass incarceration.

TI  - Focal Points, Dissident Calendars, and Preemptive Repression
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
AB  - This article explains temporal variation in repression as a function of the dissident calendar, the set of events that serve as natural focal points for coordination. The core argument is that regimes can anticipate the events that create these focal points and engage in preemptive repression to survive their passing. This dynamic produces predictable, often cyclical patterns in repression. An analysis of dissident detentions in China from 1998 to 2014 shows that focal events alone appear to be responsible for more than 20 percent of dissident detentions over the analysis period. Such detentions tend to be shorter and rely less on formal criminal procedures, suggesting a catch-and-release dynamic. Additional analysis of detentions in Tibet shows how the calendar may vary by issue or group.

TI  - An Examination of Spatial Differences between Migrant and Native Offenders in Committing Violent Crimes in a Large Chinese City
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Immigrants and natives are generally comparable in committing violent crimes in many Western cities. However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders.

TI  - Seasonal scheduling of shellfish collection in the Middle and Later Stone Ages of southern Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION
AB  - This study assesses the seasonal scheduling of shellfish harvesting among hunter-gatherer populations along the southernmost coast of South Africa, based on a large number of serial oxygen isotope analyses of marine mollusk shells from four archaeological sites. The south coast of South Africa boasts an exceptional record of coastal hunter-gatherer occupation spanning the Holocene, the last glacial cycle and beyond. The significance of coastal adaptations, in this region in particular, for later modern human evolution has been prominently debated. Shellfishing behaviors are an important focus for investigation given the dietary and scheduling implications and the abundant archaeological shell remains in numerous sites. Key to better understanding coastal foraging is whether it was limited to one particular season, or year-round. Yet, this has proven very difficult to establish by conventional archaeological methods. This study reconstructs seasonal harvesting patterns by calculating water temperatures from the final growth increment of shells. Results from two Later Stone Age sites, Nelson Bay Cave (together with the nearby Hoffman's Robberg Cave) and Byneskranskop 1, show a pronounced cool season signal, which is unexpected given previous ethnographic documentation of summer as the optimal season for shellfishing activities and inferences about hunter-gatherer scheduling and mobility in the late Holocene. Results from two Middle Stone Age sites, Klasies River and Pinnacle Point 5-6, show distinct seasonal patterns that likely reflect the seasonal availability of resources in the two locations. The Pinnacle Point 5-6 assemblage, which spans the MIS5-4 transition, records a marked shift in shellfishing seasonality at c. 71 ka that aligns with other indications of archaeological and environmental change at this time. We conclude that the scheduling and intensity of shellfishing in this region is affected by a suite of factors, including environmental and cultural drivers, rather than a single variable, such as population growth.

TI  - Discerning the Effects of Rural to Urban Migrants on Burglaries in ZG City with Structural Equation Modeling
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Both rural to urban migration and urban crime are well researched topics in China. But few studies have attempted to explore the possible relationships between the two. Using calls for service data of ZG city in 2014, the Sixth Census data in 2010, this study examines relationships between migrants and crime by using structural equation models. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) the distribution of migrants has direct effects on the spatial distribution of burglaries, and (2) migrants also indirectly affect burglary rate through mediating variables such as residential mobility and socio-economic disadvantage of their resident communities. The results showed that migrants have significant direct and indirect effects contributing to burglaries, although the indirect effect is much larger than the direct effect, indicating that community characteristics play a more important role than the migrants themselves.

AB  - Routine administration of the sexual assault medical forensic exam (commonly known as the "rape kit") is one of the most significant healthcare reforms advanced by the U.S. anti-rape movement since the 1970s. To promote reform, nurses acted as practitioner-activists in emergency medicine and created the new specialty of forensic nursing to administer the medical forensic exam independent of physicians. Their efforts suggest a new way of conceptualizing the interface of law and medicine: the proactive invocation of criminal law in clinical medicine for the purpose of institutional reform in healthcare organizations, or what I term legal mobilization in medicine. Using the framework of legal mobilization in medicine, I ask: (1) how did nurses mobilize criminal law and rights to health in emergency medicine to facilitate reform? and (2) what were the effects on clinical practice and knowledge production? To chart this history, I draw on a review of published writings by early forensic nurses, interviews with leaders in the field, and ethnographic observation at the 20th anniversary International Association of Forensic Nurses conference in 2012, commemorating the founders and origins of this new specialty. Bringing together scholarship on law and social movements in socio-legal studies and scholarship on health and social movements in science, technology, and medicine studies, I argue that nurses forged a porous boundary between the overlapping institutional spheres of medicine and law in order to align the objectives of medical care and criminal investigation and, thereby, seek rights to healthcare and rights to justice for patient-victims through the enactment of new medical routines. I demonstrate the historical emergence of a novel, hybrid form of professional jurisdiction and medical practice, and I explore its benefits as well as its unintended consequences. I conclude by discussing the ethical implications of this case for the use of medical evidence to corroborate rape.

TI  - Detecting Pickpocketing Offenders by Analyzing Beijing Metro Subway Data
T2  - 2019 4TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS (ICBDA 2019)
CP  - 4th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Analytics (ICBDA)
AB  - Nowadays, police are facing with the challenge that crime increases far more rapidly than police force, which generate many problems and cause the police have to seek for support from new technical ways. In this background, the new concept of intelligence-led-policing was proposed. This concept indicated that police should actively identify and analyze the problems by collecting data, such that the potential threatens could be known in early stage and prevention resources would be deployed in more efficient ways. In this paper, a typical work big data analysis in policing was introduced. Pick-pocketing offence is a kind of frequently occurred crime in public transportation, and identifying offenders is a great challenge for the police. With nearly a billion of metro subway traffic records accessed from Beijing metro line company, the passengers' routine mobility pattern was analyzed and some pickpocketing suspects were detected by defining some specific rules. The results indicated that significant traveling patterns exist for routine passengers, and some exceptional individuals who has the unique pattern which is quite different from routine passengers are discovered. However, the shortage of the work still exists as the identity of cardholders is anonymous and it cannot be confirmed, but it still provides an example of big data analysis in public security, which might inspire police for further work.

TI  - Text Mining for Malware Classification Using Multivariate All Repeated Patterns Detection
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2019)
CP  - IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)
AB  - Mobile phones have become nowadays a commodity to the majority of people. Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each.

TI  - Microvascular Decompression for Hemifacial Spasm Associated with Vertebral Artery: Biomedical Glue-Coated Teflon Sling Transposition Technique
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression is the most effective treatment for hemifacial spasm. However, when encountering hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery (VA), the procedure is more challenging and requires complicated operation techniques. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of this group of cases and investigated reasonable transposition procedures for different anatomic classifications.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 117 cases that underwent their first microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm between June 2010 and December 2016, which had all associated with vertebral artery compression diagnosed by preoperational radiology examination. The study first classified offending vessels into 3 types according to operative anatomy and designed personalized decompression management according to different forms of neurovascular conflict. Curative effects and complications were assessed.
   RESULTS: The offending vessels were artificially divided into 3 types according to both arterial pattern and compression direction: 1) ipsilateral VA plus anterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the ventrolateral direction in 72 (61.5%) cases; 2) ipsilateral VA plus posterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the caudal-medial direction in 31 (26.5%) cases; 3) bilateral VA compressing the facial nerve in 14 (12.0%) cases. We selected corridors to expose the neurovascular conflict site between the suprafloccular-transhorizontal fissure approach and subtonsillar-transcerebellomedullary fissure approach. The methods of decompression consist of anteromedial and posterolateral transposition by using biomedical glue- coated Teflon sling. Sufficient decompression of the offending vessels was safely performed in all cases. All cases had total relief of symptoms immediately after their operations. Follow-up periods ranged from 16-90 months, and total recovery occurred in 110 cases (94.0%). In 7 cases (6.0%), 90% recovery occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy and comprehensive recognition of anatomic features of the offending vessels are crucial for the management of hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery compression. Appropriate approaches combined with the biomedical glue-coated Teflon sling transposition technique can allow adequate mobilization of the vertebral artery and bring complete postoperative symptom relief for most cases.

TI  - Sex Offender Mobility: An Application of Crime Pattern Theory Among Child Sex Offenders
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group and exhibit various offense patterns. Often the location where the offender committed the offense is different from where the offender encountered their victim. Applying crime pattern theory, this study sought to understand if the type of location, victim, and situational characteristics could predict whether an offender would commit the sexual offense in a different and more secluded location than where he first encountered the victim. Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

TI  - Collective appropriation and cooperative uses of mobile telephony among Burmese fishers
T2  - INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Early research on mobile phone adoption among fishers followed an economistic perspective, focusing mainly on access to market price information. Researchers called for investigations into collective and cooperative uses of the technology. Responding to these calls, we explored Burmese fishers' use of mobile phones in the realms of social life and business, mainly related to information seeking and sharing among the community. Interviews with 23 fishers in three regions in Myanmar suggested that both social and commercial, as well as individual- and community-oriented, uses were prevalent. Mobile phones helped channel information on price and market demand among a limited number of fishers, especially the boat owners and fish dealers. The other segments in the fishing labor hierarchy desisted from individual ownership of the phone, while opting for a more community-based appropriation. A nuanced picture of use and non-use of mobiles emerged alongside fishers' socio-economic status and patterns of fishing.

TI  - The Organisation of Late Pleistocene Robberg Blade Technology in the Doring River Catchment, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGY
AB  - Emphasis on the production of small unretouched blades is the strongest defining technological characteristic of southern African assemblages referred to as the Robberg - a 'technologically uniform' technocomplex identified across the sub-continent. This paper explores the spatial organisation of Robberg blade technology from three rockshelter sites in the Doring River catchment of the eastern Cederberg Mountains. The Doring is both a key source of water and toolstone, and the three sites are located at varying distances from it. Blades and blade cores from these sites are used to explore the influence of distance to source on the abundance of raw materials, staging of production and maintenance/reduction of transported artefacts. Results suggest key differences in procurement and provisioning strategies for different materials. Hunter-gatherers 'geared up' with hornfels and silcrete blades at the river before moving up the tributaries where toolkits were supplemented by small numbers of blades made from transported silcrete cores and the situational use of local rock types such as quartz. Results demonstrate the importance of understanding local-scale controls on technological organisation before inferring patterns of broader behavioural import.

TI  - How Artificial Intelligence and machine learning research impacts payment card fraud detection: A survey and industry benchmark
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - The core goal of this paper is to identify guidance on how the research community can better transition their research into payment card fraud detection towards a transformation away from the current unacceptable levels of payment card fraud. Payment card fraud is a serious and long-term threat to society (Ryman-Tubb and d'Avila Garcez, 2010) with an economic impact forecast to be $416bn in 2017 (see Appendix A)(1) The proceeds of this fraud are known to finance terrorism, arms and drug crime. Until recently the patterns of fraud (fraud vectors) have slowly evolved and the criminals modus operandi (MO) has remained unsophisticated. Disruptive technologies such as smartphones, mobile payments, cloud computing and contactless payments have emerged almost simultaneously with large-scale data breaches. This has led to a growth in new fraud vectors, so that the existing methods for detection are becoming less effective. This in turn makes further research in this domain important. In this context, a timely survey of published methods for payment card fraud detection is presented with the focus on methods that use AI and machine learning. The purpose of the survey is to consistently benchmark payment card fraud detection methods for industry using transactional volumes in 2017. This benchmark will show that only eight methods have a practical performance to be deployed in industry despite the body of research. The key challenges in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to fraud detection are discerned. Future directions are discussed and it is suggested that a cognitive computing approach is a promising research direction while encouraging industry data philanthropy.

TI  - Family income inequalities and trajectories through childhood and self-harm and violence in young adults: a population-based, nested case-control study
T2  - LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Childhood poverty is associated with elevated later risks for self-directed and externalised violence, but how risks are modified by parental socioeconomic mobility remains unclear. We investigated parental income trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks of self-harm and violent criminality in young adulthood.
   Methods Using Danish national registers, we delineated a nested case-control study of Danish citizens born from Jan 1, 1982, to Dec 31, 2000, with first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and first violent crime convictions at ages 15-33 years. Each case was matched on age and gender to 25 randomly selected controls. Parental income was assessed in birth-year and at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. We considered parental age, the child's number of siblings, parental mental health, and parental education to be covariates. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by conditional logistic regression inherently adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year; we then made additional adjustments for the covariates considered.
   Findings We identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-harm, to which we matched 531 675 controls, and 23 724 first violent crime convictions, to which we matched 593 100 controls. We observed inverse relationships between parental income and risks for the two outcomes for each of the ages parental income was measured. The longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, the higher their subsequent risks for self-harm and violent criminality, and vice versa for time spent living in affluent conditions. Associations were stronger for violent criminality than for self-harm. Compared with individuals who were born and remained in the most affluent families, all other income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for both outcomes. Those who remained in the least affluent quintile showed the highest risks for self-harm (IRR 7.2, 95% CI 6.6-7.9; 1174 [6%] cases) and for violent criminality (IRR 13.0; 95% CI 11.9-14.1; 1640 [7%] cases). The risk patterns were attenuated, but essentially persisted, after covariate adjustment. For any parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated with lower risk compared with downward mobility.
   Interpretation Parental income represents a multitude of unmeasured familial sociodemographic indices. Tackling the causes of inequality and associated psychosocial and sociocultural challenges to enable upwards socioeconomic mobility could potentially reduce risks for self-directed and externalised violence.

TI  - Space-Time Analysis of Vehicle Theft Patterns in Shanghai, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - To identify and compare the space-time patterns of vehicle thefts and the effects of associated environmental factors, this paper conducts a case study of the Pudong New Area (PNA), a major urban district in Shanghai, China's largest city. Geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis indicated that there was a stable pattern of vehicle theft over time. Hotspots of vehicle theft across different time periods were identified. These data provide clues for how law enforcement can prioritize the deployment of limited patrol and investigative resources. Vehicle thefts, especially those of non-motor vehicles, tend to be concentrated in the central-western portion of the PNA, which experienced a dramatic rate of urbanization and has a high concentration of people and vehicles. Important factors contributing to vehicle thefts include a highly mobile and transitory population, a large population density, and high traffic volume.

TI  - Theft from the person in urban China: assessing the diurnal effects of opportunity and social ecology
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Opportunity theories and ecological theories are commonly used to explain spatial crime patterns, but diurnal variations in these patterns have received little attention. Furthermore, the theories have been developed in Western countries, and it has remained unclear whether they are also applicable in China, and how their core concepts can be measured in the Chinese context. We use official crime data from a large Chinese city to investigate whether neighborhood rates of theft from the person are related to characteristics of the population (ecological perspective) and to the presence of transport and retail facilities that shape daily activities (opportunity perspective). We test whether effects of these characteristics differ between daytime and nighttime. Our findings demonstrate that both theories are applicable to crime analysis in China, and that temporal variations should not be ignored. Furthermore, care is required regarding the operationalization of the concepts.

TI  - An analysis on e-waste generation in Chandigarh: quantification, disposal pattern and future predictions
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this study, an assessment of e-waste management in Chandigarh, India was done. A structured questionnaire based survey was used to know about various socio-economic characteristics. Based on the results, the quantification of, equipment wise, e-waste generation and their distinctive disposal patterns were acquired. Future, e-waste generation was also estimated using an approach investigated by Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit and Manufacturer's Association of Information Technology (GTZ-MAIT). The total amount of e-waste generation from households of Chandigarh was found out to be 3276.47 tons/annum, which was equivalent to 3.1 kg/capita/annum. It was also found that most of the e-waste generated was from the use of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) such as Mobile phones, Laptops, Cameras, Washing machines, Air conditioners, Heaters, Geysers, LEDs and LCDs. Moreover, taking the annual GDP growth rate of India into account e-waste generation from households was estimated to reach 9565.1 tons/annum by 2020. Among the various disposal channels "selling as scrap" was the most favored one among the respondents to discard the used EEE. Therefore, it can be concluded from the survey that informal sectors or scrap dealers are very active in e-waste collection as they are aware about the profitability from its dismantling and recycling.

TI  - Evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in decriminalizing mental illness: A systematic literature review
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Purpose
   People with mental illnesses are at a significantly greater risk of police arrest than the general population. This pattern of arrests has been associated with a phenomenon referred to as the criminalization of mental illness such that people with mental illnesses are inappropriately diverted to the criminal justice system rather than to treatment. To decrease arrests of people with mental illnesses experiencing a crisis, pre-booking diversion programs have been developed to intervene at the point of police contact. This systematic literature review examines the state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs by addressing the question, "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in reducing arrests (i.e., reducing criminalization) of people with mental illnesses?"
   Methods
   Systematic literature searches of seven databases were performed during May 2017. The searches sought to identify studies that examined the effectiveness of pre-booking diversion programs in decreasing arrests. A multi-phase screening process was completed independently by two pairs of reviewers as well as a risk of bias review.
   Results
   A total of 2,750 unique citations were identified. Of these, 4 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria; all were from the US. Three of the studies examined the effectiveness of Crisis Intervention Teams and one study looked at a mobile crisis program. Two of the studies were at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk.
   Conclusions
   This review indicates that this line of inquiry is still developing. There are a number of gaps yet to be filled. The current evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in reducing arrests (i.e., reducing criminalization) of people with mental illnesses is limited. However, these studies indicate there is moderate evidence that these programs increase linkages to mental health services.

TI  - Strategizing and Fatalizing: Self and Other in the Trauma Narratives of Justice-Involved Women
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - Jail admissions in the United States number nearly 1 million women annually. Many have limited access to public support and must seek assistance from family, friends, and strangers to maintain health and safety after release. This study sought to learn more about how women with a history of interpersonal trauma and criminal justice involvement perceive and manage social relationships. In-depth, story-eliciting interviews were conducted over 12 months with 10 participants who were selected from the convenience sample of an ongoing parent study in a Midwestern urban jail. Embedded trauma narratives were analyzed for self-presentation, form, and theme. The trauma narratives registered a continuum of agency, anchored at either end by patterns of strategizing talk and fatalizing talk. Providers and advocates can improve support for justice-involved women post incarceration by becoming familiar with and responding to patterns of strategizing and fatalizing in their personal narratives.

TI  - Using targeted Bayesian network learning for suspect identification in communication networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
AB  - This paper proposes a machine learning application to identify mobile phone users suspected of involvement in criminal activities. The application characterizes the behavioral patterns of suspect users versus non-suspect users based on usage metadata such as call duration, call distribution, interaction time preferences and text-to-call ratios while avoiding any access to the content of calls or messages. The application is based on targeted Bayesian network learning method. It generates a graphical network that can be used by domain experts to gain intuitive insights about the key features that can help identify suspect users. The method enables experts to manage the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy using information theory metrics. Unlike other graphical Bayesian classifiers, the proposed application accomplishes the task required of a security company, namely an accurate suspect identification rate (recall) of at least 50% with no more than a 1% false identification rate. The targeted Bayesian network learning method is also used for additional tasks such as anomaly detection, distinction between "relevant" and "irrelevant" anomalies, and for associating anonymous telephone numbers with existing users by matching behavioral patterns.

TI  - European Youth Gang Policy in Comparative Context
T2  - CHILDREN & SOCIETY
AB  - The past decade has seen increased reports of street gangs across a range of contexts. In Europe, anxieties over street-based youth has led to the development of gang-specific policies across a range of jurisdictions, most notably the UK. Following a similar pattern of policy mobility in criminal justice, many of these policies have origins in the US system. In this review of international gang policy developments, we critically examine a number of these policies in a comparative context - including gang policing units and intelligence databases - and interrogate their efficacy. Drawing on cogent examples from the UK, we argue for caution in adopting US gang intervention tactics due to the lack of empirical evidence relating to their applicability or efficacy, and the corresponding potential for discrimination toward the most marginalised and socially excluded children and young people in society.

TI  - Mobile Forensic Data Analysis: Suspicious Pattern Detection in Mobile Evidence
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Culprits' identification by the means of suspicious pattern detection techniques from mobile device data is one of the most important aims of the mobile forensic data analysis. When criminal activities are related to entirely automated procedures such as malware propagation, predicting the corresponding behavior is a rather achievable task. However, when human behavior is involved, such as in cases of traditional crimes, prediction and detection become more compelling. This paper introduces a combined criminal profiling and suspicious pattern detection methodology for two criminal activities with moderate to the heavy involvement of mobile devices, cyberbullying and low-level drug dealing. Neural and Neurofuzzy techniques are applied on a hybrid original and simulated dataset. The respective performance results are measured and presented, the optimal technique is selected, and the scenarios are re-run on an actual dataset for additional testing and verification.

T2  - 2018 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDEMOCRACY & EGOVERNMENT (ICEDEG)
CP  - 5th International Conference on eDemocracy and eGovernment (ICEDEG)
AB  - Modern communication is ubiquitous thanks to the advances in mobile devices and the spread of social networks across the world. It allows people to share ideas, opinions, and experiences. With an ever grown number of users, third party entities promote their services through online advertisements aimed to attract more customers. These services can be even illegal, making this kind of ads deceptive. In this work, we study the use of tweeter for human trafficking criminal network. Mining data from tweets, primarily to identify hidden information is a complicated process, which even requires human intervention. Thus, more sophisticated natural language methods are necessary. In our experiments, the term punters had the most explicit message related to human trafficking services, we find some phrases that depending on the context could lead to criminal activities, and we show that temporal analysis seems an exciting research area to identify behavioral patterns which certainly can help to combat this kind of criminal networks.

TI  - Agent-Based Simulation of Offender Mobility: Integrating Activity Nodes from Location-Based Social Networks
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS (AAMAS' 18)
CP  - 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (AAMAS)
AB  - In recent years, simulation techniques have been applied to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime. Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with prevention strategies, and crime prediction purposes, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents an agent-based model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure and location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as proxy for human activity. 18 mobility strategies have been tested, combining search distance strategies (e.g. Levy flight, inspired by insights in human dynamics literature) and destination selection strategies (enriched with Foursquare data). We analyze and compare the different mobility strategies, and show the impact of using activity nodes extracted from social networks to simulate offender mobility. This agent-based model provides a basis for comparing offender mobility in crime simulations by inferring offender mobility in urban areas from real world data.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2018 15TH INTERNATIONAL BHURBAN CONFERENCE ON APPLIED SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY (IBCAST)
CP  - 15th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences and Technology (IBCAST)
AB  - Increased use of secure chat and voice/ video apps has transformed the social life. While the benefits and facilitations are seemingly limitless, so are the asscoiacted vulnerabilities and threats. Besides ensuring confidentiality requirements for common users, known facts of non-readable contents over the network make these apps more attractive for criminals. Though access to contents of cryptograhically secure sessions is not possible, network forensics of secure apps can provide interesting information which can be of great help during criminal invetigations. In this paper, we presented a novel framework of profiling the secure chat and voice/ video calling apps which can be employed to extract hidden patterns about the app, information of involved parties, activities of chatting, voice/ video calls, status indications and notifications while having no information of communication protocol of the app and its security architecture. Signatures of any secure app can be developed though our framework and can become base of a large scale solution. Our methodology is considered very important for different cases of criminal investigations and bussiness intelligence solutions for service provider networks. Our results are applicable to any mobile platform of iOS, android and windows.

TI  - Institutional Reform and Violence Reduction in Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
AB  - If institutions are important for regulating violence, can institutional reforms make societies less violent? This article examines the north-east Brazilian state of Pernambuco primarily between 2007 and 2013, proposing that patterns of declining lethal violence can be explained by changes in both the accountability and effectiveness of formal state institutions and informal social norms. Drawing on two months of qualitative fieldwork, findings suggest that social and political mobilisation enabled a political coalition to initiate substantial changes under the Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life) public-security programme, which improved the legitimacy and operational effectiveness of the criminal justice system, and coincided with a marked reduction in homicide rates. While showing that these reforms were central in reducing lethal violence in Pernambuco between 2007 and 2013, the article concludes by discussing the challenges of policy continuity in light of increasing rates of lethal violence since 2014.

TI  - Eye tracking to evaluate evidence recognition in crime scene investigations
T2  - FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Crime scene analysts are the core of criminal investigations; decisions made at the scene greatly affect the speed of analysis and the quality of conclusions, thereby directly impacting the successful resolution of a case. If an examiner fails to recognize the pertinence of an item on scene, the analyst's theory regarding the crime will be limited. Conversely, unselective evidence collection will most likely include irrelevant material, thus increasing a forensic laboratory's backlog and potentially sending the investigation into an unproductive and costly direction. Therefore, it is critical that analysts recognize and properly evaluate forensic evidence that can assess the relative support of differing hypotheses related to event reconstruction. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to determine if quantitative eye tracking data and qualitative reconstruction accuracy could be used to distinguish investigator expertise. In order to assess this, 32 participants were successfully recruited and categorized as experts or trained novices based on their practical experiences and educational backgrounds. Each volunteer then processed a mock crime scene while wearing a mobile eye tracker, wherein visual fixations, durations, search patterns, and reconstruction accuracy were evaluated. The eye tracking data (dwell time and task percentage on areas of interest or AOIs) were compared using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Needleman-Wunsch (N-W) algorithm, revealing significant group differences for both search duration (EMD), as well as search sequence (N-W). More specifically, experts exhibited greater dissimilarity in search duration, but greater similarity in search sequences than their novice counterparts. In addition to the quantitative visual assessment of examiner variability, each participant's reconstruction skill was assessed using a 22-point binary scoring system, in which significant group differences were detected as a function of total reconstruction accuracy. This result, coupled with the fact that the study failed to detect a significant difference between the groups when evaluating the total time needed to complete the investigation, indicates that experts are more efficient and effective. Finally, the results presented here provide a basis for continued research in the use of eye trackers to assess expertise in complex and distributed environments, including suggestions for future work, and cautions regarding the degree to which visual attention can infer cognitive understanding.

TI  - Automatic gang graffiti recognition and interpretation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
AB  - One of the roles of emergency first responders (e.g., police and fire departments) is to prevent and protect against events that can jeopardize the safety and well-being of a community. In the case of criminal gang activity, tools are needed for finding, documenting, and taking the necessary actions to mitigate the problem or issue. We describe an integrated mobile-based system capable of using location-based services, combined with image analysis, to track and analyze gang activity through the acquisition, indexing, and recognition of gang graffiti images. This approach uses image analysis methods for color recognition, image segmentation, and image retrieval and classification. A database of gang graffiti images is described that includes not only the images but also metadata related to the images, such as date and time, geoposition, gang, gang member, colors, and symbols. The user can then query the data in a useful manner. We have implemented these features both as applications for Android and iOS hand-held devices and as a web-based interface. (C) 2017 SPIE and IS&T

TI  - Using a programmatic mapping approach to plan for HIV prevention and harm reduction interventions for people who inject drugs in three South African cities
T2  - HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Stigma, criminalisation and a lack of data on drug use contribute to the "invisibility" of people who inject drugs (PWID) and make HIV prevention and treatment service delivery challenging. We aimed to confirm locations where PWID congregate in Cape Town, eThekwini and Tshwane (South Africa) and to estimate PWID population sizes within selected electoral wards in these areas to inform South Africa's first multi-site HIV prevention project for PWID.
   Methods: Field workers (including PWID peers) interviewed community informants to identify suspected injecting locations in selected electoral wards in each city and then visited these locations and interviewed PWID. Interviews were used to gather information about the accessibility of sterile injecting equipment, location coordinates and movement patterns. We used the Delphi method to obtain final population size estimates for the mapped wards based on estimates from wisdom of the crowd methods, the literature and programmatic data.
   Results: Between January and April 2015, we mapped 45 wards. Tshwane teams interviewed 39 PWID in 12 wards, resulting in an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging from 568 to 1431. In eThekwini, teams interviewed 40 PWID in 15 wards with an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging from 184 to 350. The Cape Town team interviewed 61 PWID in 18 wards with an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging between 398 and 503. Sterile needles were only available at one location. Almost all needles were bought from pharmacies. Between 80 and 86% of PWID frequented more than one location per day. PWID who reported movement visited a median of three locations a day.
   Conclusions: Programmatic mapping led by PWID peers can be used effectively to identify and reach PWID and build relationships where access to HIV prevention commodities for PWID is limited. PWID reported limited access to sterile injecting equipment, highlighting an important HIV prevention need. Programmatic mapping data show that outreach programmes should be flexible and account for the mobile nature of PWID populations. The PWID population size estimates can be used to develop service delivery targets and as baseline measures.

TI  - Offender Mobility During the Crime: Investigating the Variability of Crime Event Contexts and Associated Outcomes in Stranger Sexual Assaults
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Using data from qualitative interviews and police reports, latent class analysis is used on a sample of 54 repeat stranger sexual offenders who committed 204 sexual assaults to identify discrete contexts present at the time of victim encounter that influence these offenders' decision to use more than one location to commit their crimes. Five distinct classes are identified: residential outdoor common area, spontaneous/quiet outdoor site, residential home, active green space, and indoor/public gathering place. An investigation into the outcome(s) that most often result from the offender's decision to move the victim during the sexual assault indicates that those who move the victim from an active green space overwhelmingly engage in sexual penetration, as well as forcing their victims to commit sexual acts on them. Crimes where the victim is moved from a residential home show evidence of the offender physically harming the victim as well as using more force than necessary to complete the assault. Implications for situational crime prevention are discussed.

TI  - Flexible cultural repertoires: Young men avoiding offending and victimization in township areas of Cape Town
T2  - ETHNOGRAPHY
AB  - Despite extensive studies of street culture and the risks of offending and victimization in urban marginalized areas, little is known about the role of cultural repertoires for variation in victimization risks among young men not involved in crime. Based on two ethnographic studies, conducted independently of the authors in neighbouring township areas of Cape Town, we offer insights into patterns of victimization among young men not involved in crime who live and attend school in the townships. Young men who perform decent cultural repertoires are highly exposed to victimization due to their moral rejection of crime-involved youth. Young men who perform flexible cultural repertoires, by incorporating and shifting between gang and decent repertoires, experience low victimization due to their adaptation to crime-involved youth. Findings emphasize the importance of detailed investigations of the way varying cultural repertoires, in particularly heterogeneous flexible repertoires, influence offending and victimization patterns among young men in high-risk settings.

TI  - The Mobilization of Criminal Law
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCE, VOL 13
AB  - Perhaps few decisions havemore of an impact on the operational functioning of the criminal justice system than the decision by victims of crime to notify the police. Researchers in the United States and abroad have found that victims often choose not to mobilize the criminal law in the aftermath of a victimization event. A large percentage of property and violent crimes never appear in official crime data estimates. Most remain hidden in the dark figure of crime. Victim nonreporting has numerous implications for criminal justice system processing, crime control policy, and substantive research on the causes and correlates of crime. Studies have long sought to identify the victim-, incident-, and community-based mechanisms that might account for patterns of police notification. Although several important findings have emerged, critical questions remain unanswered. This article provides a critical overview of the determinants of victim nonreporting and charts potential avenues for future research.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS (ICKEA)
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Applications (ICKEA)
AB  - The flourishing of social networking applications (SNA) in recent years has revolutionized the way we live. On the other hand, SNA are also used for malicious activities. Identifying the physical person behind a SNA account is a challenge task in investigations of SNA-involved criminal cases. As one way to address this challenge, automatic user attribute inference, which is also referred to as user profiling, has become an increasingly attractive research topic. However, existing methods may suffer from problems such as low quality content and complex social networks. The increasing amounts of user-generated geolocation data on SNA give rise to new opportunities for user profiling. In this paper, we study the problem of user profiling with user-generated geolocation data. Specifically, we take occupation profiling as an entry point. We design a supervised occupation classification framework and propose two categories of geolocation-based features, i.e., mobility pattern features (MPF) and location preference features (LPF). Experiments performed using real-world SNA data reveal that LPF can indicate the occupation to a certain extent and are more efficient than word count features and TF-IDF features. Moreover, it is also revealed that good occupation profiling accuracy can be achieved by integrating LPF and LDA topic features inferred from text content.

CP  - IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)
AB  - Understanding the geographic and environmental factors that affect local criminal activity is important for crime prevention. In this study, we use data from Geo-Twitter to analyze the reasons underlying the occurrence of local criminal activity. In recent years, abundant location-based social network (LBSN )(e.g., Foursquare, Geo-Twitter) data has become easily available at a low cost. Therefore, many studies have used LBSNs data to model and understand human mobile behavior, such as patterns of human travel and activity. However, few studies on local criminal activities have been reported. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to identify the reasons underlying local criminal activity from the view point of geographic and environmental factors. Our methodology consists of the following steps. First, we collect geo-tagged data from Twitter. In particular, we extract a large corpus with geo-tags, called tweets, from major cities in the United States. Second, we measure the sentiments expressed in tweets posted from a specific area using the fastText model [1]. Third, we apply a simple clustering technique called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify the topics that are clustered in each area using sentimental analysis. Lastly, we analyze the reasons for crime by comparing the topics and the information on all crime using the data portal.

TI  - Distinct neuronal patterns of positive and negative moral processing in psychopathy
T2  - COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Psychopathy is a disorder characterized by severe and frequent moral violations in multiple domains of life. Numerous studies have shown psychopathy-related limbic brain abnormalities during moral processing; however, these studies only examined negatively valenced moral stimuli. Here, we aimed to replicate prior psychopathy research on negative moral judgments and to extend this work by examining psychopathy-related abnormalities in the processing of controversial moral stimuli and positive moral processing. Incarcerated adult males (N = 245) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol on a mobile imaging system stationed at the prison. Psychopathy was assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Participants were then shown words describing three types of moral stimuli: wrong (e.g., stealing), not wrong (e.g., charity), and controversial (e.g., euthanasia). Participants rated each stimulus as either wrong or not wrong. PCL-R total scores were correlated with not wrong behavioral responses to wrong moral stimuli, and were inversely related to hemodynamic activity in the anterior cingulate cortex in the contrast of wrong > not wrong. In the controversial > noncontroversial comparison, psychopathy was inversely associated with activity in the temporal parietal junction and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that psychopathy-related abnormalities are observed during the processing of complex, negative, and positive moral stimuli.

TI  - Cross-border crime patterns unveiled by exchange of DNA profiles in the European Union
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - The aim of this study was to make a head start with unveiling transnational spatial patterns in offending. To that end, data are used from DNA profile exchange between The Netherlands and 18 other EU member states that have implemented EU legislation on forensic cooperation. Information was collected on all DNA stains entered into the database, including the region in The Netherlands where the stain was secured, the type of crime and how many matching DNA profiles had been identified in each of the other 18 countries. The results suggest that currently the profiles of offenders who are active in other Pram countries make up for about 4 per cent of all DNA stain profiles in the Dutch DNA database. The highest share of cross-border matches is found in the southeastern part of The Netherlands, where The Netherlands borders one of the most densely populated regions of Germany.

TI  - Abnormal fronto-limbic engagement in incarcerated stimulant users during moral processing
T2  - PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Stimulant use is a significant and prevalent problem, particularly in criminal populations. Previous studies found that cocaine and methamphetamine use is related to impairment in identifying emotions and empathy. Stimulant users also have abnormal neural structure and function of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and anterior (ACC) and posterior cingulate (PCC), regions implicated in moral decision-making. However, no research has studied the neural correlates of stimulant use and explicit moral processing in an incarcerated population.
   Here, we examine how stimulant use affects sociomoral processing that might contribute to antisocial behavior. We predicted that vmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and ACC would show abnormal neural response during a moral processing task in incarcerated methamphetamine and cocaine users.
   Incarcerated adult males (N = 211) were scanned with a mobile MRI system while completing a moral decision-making task. Lifetime drug use was assessed. Neural responses during moral processing were compared between users and non-users. The relationship between duration of use and neural function was also examined.
   Incarcerated stimulant users showed less amygdala engagement than non-users during moral processing. Duration of stimulant use was negatively associated with activity in ACC and positively associated with vmPFC response during moral processing.
   These results suggest a dynamic pattern of fronto-limbic moral processing related to stimulant use with deficits in both central motive and cognitive integration elements of biological moral processes theory. This increases our understanding of how drug use relates to moral processing in the brain in an ultra-high-risk population.

TI  - Exploring the impact of ambient population measures on London crime hotspots
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: Crime analysts need accurate population-at-risk measures to quantify crime rates. This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for 'theft from the person' crimes.
   Method:
   1. Collect 'ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media.
   2. Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor.
   3. Use the G(i)* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators.
   4. Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates.
   Results and Discussion: The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors - i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people.

TI  - Identification of smartphone brand and model via forensic video analysis
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Recording videos on smartphones and other mobile devices, given their enormous popularity, is currently very common. The portability of these devices facilitates their use for recording videos in a wide variety of situations, including while witnessing criminal activities. These videos can be later used as evidence in legal proceedings. Therefore, the forensic analysis of videos taken with mobile device videos is important, and could serve for legal and also investigative purposes. It is necessary, however, to use techniques that are quite specific to this type of devices, given some peculiar features of their cameras. In this paper, we will address the issue of video source acquisition identification by presenting a technique based on sensor noise and wavelet transform extraction from video key frames. These frames are extracted using an efficient algorithm that takes their content into account, improving the selection of frames to be analyzed over past proposals. The scheme presented consists of four stages: (1) Key frames extraction, (2) sensor pattern noise extraction, (3) feature extraction, and (4) classifier training and prediction. We also present experimental results that support the validity of the techniques used and show promising results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The association between childhood relocations and subsequent risk of suicide attempt, psychiatric problems, and low academic achievement
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Given the frequency with which families change residences, the effects of childhood relocations have gained increasing research attention. Many researchers have demonstrated that childhood relocations are associated with a variety of adverse outcomes. However, drawing strong causal claims remains problematic due to uncontrolled confounding factors.
   Method We utilized longitudinal, population-based Swedish registers to generate a nationally representative sample of offspring born 1983-1997 (n = 1 510 463). Using Cox regression and logistic regression, we examined the risk for numerous adverse outcomes after childhood relocation while controlling for measured covariates. To account for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounds, we also compared differentially exposed cousins and siblings.
   Results In the cohort baseline model, each annual relocation was associated with risk for the adverse outcomes, including suicide attempt [hazard ratio (HR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.20]. However, when accounting for offspring and parental covariates (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.09), as well as genetic and environmental confounds shared by cousins (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.09) and siblings (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.04), the risk for suicide attempt attenuated. We found a commensurate pattern of results for severe mental illness, substance abuse, criminal convictions, and low academic achievement.
   Conclusions Previous research may have overemphasized the independent association between relocations and later adverse outcomes. The results suggest that the association between childhood relocations and suicide attempt, psychiatric problems, and low academic achievement is partially explained by genetic and environmental confounds correlated with relocations. This study demonstrates the importance of using family-based, quasi-experimental designs to test plausible alternate hypotheses when examining causality.

TI  - <i>Qenja</i>: child fostering and relocation practices in the Amhara region, Ethiopia
T2  - CHILDRENS GEOGRAPHIES
AB  - In this article we discuss temporary relocation and informal labour of children in rural Ethiopia. We respond to the call to understand the wider logic underlying child relocation and non-parental residence among populations experiencing poverty' (Boyden, J. 2013. We're Not Going to Suffer Like this in the Mud: Educational Aspirations, Social Mobility and Independent Child Migration among Populations Living in Poverty. Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education 43 (5): 580-600. 582). Drawing on the perspectives of children and families involved in the practice of qenja (meaning teaming' or forming a coalition') we examine how - in contexts of uneven distribution of rural labour - children's involvement in transient agricultural labour outside the home is a fundamental feature of social reproduction. We argue that qenja is a social coping strategy that co-exists alongside gendered and generational relations of household production and reproduction. An understanding of the practice as merely transactional and exploitative ignores long-standing community strategies of labour acquisition and redistribution. We stress that child protection campaigns by non-governmental organizations and national legislations that intend to criminalize the practice are not in the interest of children, families, and communities.

T2  - CONTEMPORARY BRITISH HISTORY
AB  - This article demonstrates the reconceptualisation of female criminality in interwar British popular culture. It argues that in fiction and the popular press, the period signalled the rise of the strategic female career criminal who challenged traditional gendered patterns of law-breaking, appropriated wider notions of fashionable modernity and transgressed social and geographic boundaries as poorer women embraced new opportunities for masquerade and used crime for upward social mobility. The article shows that the modern female criminal reflected broader shifts and changes in opportunities and roles for women, suggesting that she functions as a prism through which to explore wider debates and anxieties around femininity, 1918-1939.

T2  - DISCO 2016: TOWARDS OPEN EDUCATION AND INFORMATION SOCIETY
CP  - 11th International Conference on Towards Open Education and Information Society (DisCo)
AB  - Corruption cases represented in media are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of all corruption cases happening in society. However, media itself is not only a scene of discourse about corruption but an important tool of enlarging publicity regarding the topics of corruption. In this paper we take considerations for an exploratory basic research with focus groups of X-, Y- and Z-generations. In this paper we gather the most problematic aspects of corruption representation in old and new media, emphasizing the importance of social context. A future mission is given to teachers and media experts: creating a cross-curricular MIL education system including the topic of media and integrity by forming recommendations in integrity education. Informal education may fruitfully apply several platforms and techniques to promote the integrity approach: mobile applications, development of the existing SNSs to give a broader awareness and recognition, elaborating gamified methods for anti-corruption and integrity (just like it happened in the case of Integrity Game and - concerning to data security - by Data Dealer game [datadealer.com]). Ultimately, after mapping the correlations and finishing the research we can explore the potential target group of such games, applications and informal education programs (CSR activities) and their attitudes, thoughts and interest in a qualitative way.

T2  - SECURITY OF INFORMATION AND NETWORKS (SIN'16)
CP  - 9th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN)
AB  - Botnets have become one of the most significant cyber threats over the last decade. The diffusion of the "Internet of Things" and its for-profit exploitation, contributed to botnets spread and sophistication, thus providing real, efficient and profitable criminal cyber-services. Recent research on botnet detection focuses on traffic pattern-based detection, and on analyzing the network traffic generated by the infected hosts, in order to find behavioral patterns independent from the specific payloads, architectures and protocols. In this paper we address the periodic behavioral patterns of infected hosts communicating with their Command-and-Control servers. The main novelty introduced is related to the traffic analysis in the frequency domain without using the well-known Fast Fourier Transform. Moreover, the mentioned analysis is performed through the exploitation of the proxy logs, easily deployable on almost every real-world scenario, from enterprise networks to mobile devices.

CP  - 7th IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)
AB  - Android enabled mobiles/ devices are high in use by huge number of users for various purposes. Other than for just calling, most of the users are using these devices for storing and maintaining important data such as personal information, calendar schedules, photos, videos, office documents and much more. These devices are also used for chatting through various instant chat messaging and social networking applications, emailing and internet browsing. In the investigation of many of the cyber crime cases, digital devices enabled with an android operating system are found as prime evidence at the crime scenes. With these devices an investigator can get the handful of information to track the call records, chat messages and activities on the device links to crime happened. This evidence is very useful in tracking down the culprit or criminals involved in the cyber crimes. In order to analyze the found devices, the devices lock must be bypassed to access the available sources of evidence in the digital form. This paper discusses the rooting of the android devices and methods to bypass the pattern lock.

TI  - Catching up faster data in digital crime using mobile devices
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Mass storage media are becoming increasingly common due to the spread of smartphones to which new technologies are applied. Correspondingly, the amount of data collected from digital crime has considerably increased. Previously, if an investigator did not properly conduct the initial response, valuable evidence would be lost. Thus, collection of digital evidence within a short time frame is required. Further, in searches using data from the smartphones to gather evidence, evidence must be collected and analyzed quickly. Therefore, in this paper, a method is proposed for rapidly collecting data at a crime scene based on the type of criminal charge. Once implemented, our method can collect data by accounting for each feature of the software, providing rapid results through a pattern search. There is also a range of options available with parallel routines. Single or multiple options can be utilized depending on the investigator's requirements.

TI  - How Far to Travel? A Multilevel Analysis of the Residence-to-Crime Distance
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study investigates whether individual- and area-level factors explain variation in the residence-to-crime distances (RC distance) for 10 offense types.
   Five years of police data from Dallas, Texas, are analyzed using multilevel models (hierarchical-linear/multi-level modeling).
   Residence-to-crime distances for Dallas offenders varied notably across offense types. Although several area characteristics such as residential instability and concentrated immigration were associated with the overall variance in RC distance, neither these nor the individual-level characteristics used in our models explained the offense-type variance in the RC distance.
   Although individual- and neighborhood-level factors did not explain substantial variation in RC distance across the various offenses, neighborhood-level factors explained a significant portion of neighborhood-level variance. Other finding included a curvilinear effect of age on RC distance. The salience of these findings and their implications for future research and offender travel theory are discussed.

TI  - The impact of using social media data in crime rate calculations: shifting hot spots and changing spatial patterns
T2  - CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB  - Crime rate is a statistic used to summarize the risk of criminal events. However, research has shown that choosing the appropriate denominator is non-trivial. Different crime types exhibit different spatial opportunities and so does the population at risk. The residential population is the most commonly used population at risk, but is unlikely to be suitable for crimes that involve mobile populations. In this article, we use "crowd-sourced" data in Leeds, England, to measure the population at risk, considering violent crime. These new data sources have the potential to represent mobile populations at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than other available data. Through the use of two local spatial statistics (Getis-Ord GI* and the Geographical Analysis Machine) and visualization, we show that when the volume of social media messages, as opposed to the residential population, is used as a proxy for the population at risk, criminal event hot spots shift spatially. Specifically, the results indicate a significant shift in the city center, eliminating its hot spot. Consequently, if crime reduction/prevention efforts are based on resident population based crime rates, such efforts may not only be ineffective in reducing criminal event risk, but be a waste of public resources.

TI  - Sexual Behaviors and Partner-Specific Correlates of Heterosexual Anal Intercourse Among Truck Drivers and Their Wives in South India
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
AB  - It is important to know about patterns of sexual behaviors among married couples in order to develop effective HIV prevention strategies for them. Herein we describe the sexual behaviors, estimate prevalence of anal intercourse (AI) among truck drivers ("truckers") and their wives, and determine partner-specific demographic and behavioral correlates of AI. We carried out a cluster-sampled cross-sectional survey among 18-49 year-old wives and their trucker husbands in a south Indian district. Data were collected by same-gender research team members with color-coded computer-assisted interviews. We used random intercept logistic regression to identify the independent correlates of AI. Thirteen percent of 475 wives and 467 truckers reported ever having AI with their spouse. Of those who responded, 55 % of 40 wives and 47 % of 36 truckers never used condoms during AI. Of those who responded, 22 of 32 wives and 24 of 32 husbands felt that condoms were unnecessary during AI. Reporting ever having AI was associated with younger age and higher education of both husband and wife. AI reported by wives was associated with having sexual partner(s) other than husband (adjusted OR 8.8 [95 % CI 3.2-24.0]), correctly answering all HIV knowledge items (adjusted OR 4.9 [95 % CI 1.9-12.5]), husband's sexual debut occurring before marriage (adjusted OR 1.9 [95 % CI 1.0-3.5]), and husband's high HIV risk perception (adjusted OR 2.5 [95 % CI 1.2-5.4]). AI reported by truckers was associated with having sex with a male or transgender (adjusted OR 4.0 [95 % CI 1.2-13.3]). Reported prevalence of AI was high considering that in India anal sex is non-normative, heavily stigmatized and, criminal. Indian heterosexual mobile populations need to be informed about the greater risk of HIV infection consequent to unprotected AI.

TI  - From Private Nuisance to Criminal Behaviour: Neighbour Problems and Neighbourhood Context in an Australian City
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - The problems that arise between neighbours have not received the academic scrutiny they deserve despite neighbour problems and disputes appearing to be a growing phenomenon. In this paper, we begin to address this omission by examining the kinds of problems residents in the city of Brisbane, Australia, are likely to encounter with neighbours and identifying patterns in their distribution on the basis of neighbourhood characteristics. Making a distinction between private nuisance problems on the one hand and antisocial and criminal behaviour on the other hand, we observe how neighbourhood levels of concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility and population density all increase the chances of residents encountering a combination of nuisance and antisocial or criminal neighbour problems over nuisance problems only or no problems at all. Conversely, a higher concentration of foreign-born residents is found to be associated with residents being more likely to experience nuisance or no problems over more criminal and antisocial forms.

AB  - In this paper, we are examining and analyzing human behavior model throughout reality data sources to extract patterns and clues of criminal and suspicious acts. Reality data composed of the digital traces people leave while interacting with computing devices. In this paper, we are focusing on data from people's interaction with social networks and mobile usage such as location markers and call logs. This work also introduces a model for detecting suspicious behavior based on social network feeds. It is based on classification model that can categorize a set of input actions and movements into three types of behavior, criminal, suspicious, or normal. The proposed system is expected to help crime analysts create faster and precise decisions. The model is expected to provide a behavior profile to help crime analysts in the process of crime prevention, understanding crime motivations, and proactive policing.

TI  - IMPACT OF VICTIMIZATION ON RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY: EXPLAINING RACIAL AND ETHNIC PATTERNS USING THE NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Criminal victimization is known to influence households' moving decisions, but theories suggest that the processes leading to a moving decision can vary across racial and ethnic groups. Drawing from current literature, we hypothesized that victimization would have a stronger effect on moving decisions for Whites than for Blacks or Hispanics, and that racial/ethnic residential segregation would moderate the impact of victimization on mobility. Using a longitudinal sample of 34,134 housing units compiled from the National Crime Victimization Survey for the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States (1995-2003), we found results that both support and contradict the hypotheses. Specifically, White residents display consistent evidence that victimization is a significant predictor of household mobility. Blacks and Hispanics, in contrast, are more varied in their moving behavior after victimization. In addition, significant differences exist among these groups in responses to victimization and in how mobility is influenced by residential segregation. Higher levels of residential segregation play a part in the victimization-mobility relationship among Blacks in a way that is more complex than we hypothesized.

TI  - Mental health at the intersections: The impact of complex needs on police contact and custody for Indigenous Australian men
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Indigenous Australians experience significant social risk, vulnerability and disadvantage. Nowhere is this more starkly demonstrated than in the levels of contact that Indigenous Australians have with the criminal justice system, particularly the police. Utilizing a linked dataset of extant criminal justice, human and health service administrative data in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, this paper explores patterns of police contact and custody for a cohort of Indigenous males with complex needs. Four significant factors are identified that alone or in combination appear to impact on the frequency with which these men experience police contact and custody, including young age at first police contact, experiencing out of home care as a child, alcohol misuse, and limited locational mobility. Whilst it might be expected that the presence of mental ill-health and/or cognitive disability would be a key predictor of the frequency and intensity of police contact and custody, the findings suggest rather that the presence of multiple disadvantages beginning in the early years and compounding throughout individuals' lives, in which mental illness may or may not be a factor, is more significant than the presence of any one diagnosis in precipitating police contact and custody for this group.

TI  - Distribution and Chemical Speciation of Arsenic in Ancient Human Hair Using Synchrotron Radiation
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Pre-Columbian populations that inhabited the Tarapaci mid river valley in the Atacama Desert in Chile during the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate Period (AD 500-1450) show patterns of chronic poisoning due to exposure to geogenic arsenic. Exposure of these people to arsenic was assessed using synchrotron-based elemental X-ray fluorescence mapping, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectromicroscopy measurements on ancient human hair.- These combined techniques of high sensitivity and specificity enabled the discrimination between endogenous and exogenous processes that has been an analytical challenge for archeological studies and criminal investigations in which hair is used as a proxy of premortem metabolism. The high concentration of arsenic mainly in the form of inorganic As(III) and As(V) detected in the hair suggests chronic arsenicism through ingestion of As-polluted water rather than external contamination by the deposition of heavy metals due to metallophilic soil microbes or diffusion of arsenic from the soil. A decrease in arsenic concentration from the proximal to the distal end of the hair shaft analyzed may indicate a change in the diet due to mobility, though chemical or microbiologically induced processes during burial cannot be entirely ruled out.

TI  - A Mobile Visual Analytics Approach for Law Enforcement Situation Awareness
T2  - 2014 IEEE PACIFIC VISUALIZATION SYMPOSIUM (PACIFICVIS)
CP  - IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)
AB  - The advent of modern smartphones and handheld devices has given analysts, decision-makers, and even the general public the ability to rapidly ingest data and translate it into actionable information on-the-go. In this paper, we explore the design and use of a mobile visual analytics toolkit for public safety data that equips law enforcement agencies with effective situation awareness and risk assessment tools. Our system provides users with a suite of interactive tools that allow them to perform analysis and detect trends, patterns and anomalies among criminal, traffic and civil (CTC) incidents. The system also provides interactive risk assessment tools that allow users to identify regions of potential high risk and determine the risk at any user-specified location and time. Our system has been designed for the iPhone/iPad environment and is currently being used and evaluated by a consortium of law enforcement agencies. We report their use of the system and some initial feedback.

TI  - A Group Member Search Method Based on Similarity Analysis of Mobile Patterns
T2  - FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING (ICICIP)
CP  - 5th International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing (ICICP)
AB  - Searching for the group members that participate in a joint action based on collecting and analyzing the position information of moving objects could provide an important support for the decision makers in the fields such as the investigation of criminal cases, group emergency disposal, a large- scale military action etc. Following the pattern analysis of mobile objects based on their position information, this paper proposes a group member search method for mobile objects based on pattern similarity, which identifies group members by utilizing the correlation information of the mobility attributes such as trajectory, speed, direction and acceleration. Compared with group clustering or classification based on trajectory distance, the overlapping interference can be effectively avoided between members in different groups, and this method fits the objective law of group movement better. Combining with the application background, the experimental analysis confirms that the proposed method can quickly and accurately find the group members.

TI  - TRANSITORY MOBILITY, CULTURAL HETEROGENEITY, AND VICTIMIZATION RISK AMONG YOUNG MEN OF COLOR: INSIGHTS FROM AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY IN CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - The coupling of racial and economic stratification has been found to result in a range of adverse outcomes for youth of color, including disproportionate exposure to violence and victimization. Primary explanations of these patterns, particularly at the micro-level, have focused on the impact of street culture. In this article, we draw from a multiyear ethnography in Cape Town, South Africa, to offer a theoretical elaboration of the place of culture in contributing to victimization risks among urban minority young men. The study is based on data collected from a sample of 26 young men of color who lived on the Cape Flats between 2003 and 2006. Using grounded theory methods, we suggest the import of unequal access to spatial mobility as a multifaceted means by which culture mediates young men's risks for victimization in disadvantaged communities. We find that transitory mobilityconceptualized as youth's temporary access to cultural spaces outside their segregated residential neighborhoodsis an important source of cultural heterogeneity in townships that can intensify the strength of local social identities and outgroup antipathies directed at those whose mobility is perceived as a cultural threat. Transitorily mobile young men's cultural repertoires are a key facet of street efficacy that can either insulate them from risk or heighten their vulnerabilities. Our findings are suggestive of important sources of variation in young men's victimization outcomes in disadvantaged communities, offering insights about factors that shape risks beyond those linked to the victim-offender overlap in high-risk settings.

TI  - Social Class Rank, Essentialism, and Punitive Judgment
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that perceptions of social class rank influence a variety of social cognitive tendencies, from patterns of causal attribution to moral judgment. In the present studies we tested the hypotheses that upper-class rank individuals would be more likely to endorse essentialist lay theories of social class categories (i.e., that social class is founded in genetically based, biological differences) than would lower-class rank individuals and that these beliefs would decrease support for restorative justice which seeks to rehabilitate offenders, rather than punish unlawful action. Across studies, higher social class rank was associated with increased essentialism of social class categories (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and decreased support for restorative justice (Study 4). Moreover, manipulated essentialist beliefs decreased preferences for restorative justice (Study 3), and the association between social class rank and class-based essentialist theories was explained by the tendency to endorse beliefs in a just world (Study 2). Implications for how class-based essentialist beliefs potentially constrain social opportunity and mobility are discussed.

TI  - Brain Response to Empathy-Eliciting Scenarios Involving Pain in Incarcerated Individuals With Psychopathy
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Importance: A marked lack of empathy is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with psychopathy. However, neural processes associated with empathic processing have not yet been directly examined in psychopathy, especially in response to the perception of other people in pain and distress.
   Objective: To identify potential differences in patterns of neural activity in incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated persons serving as controls during the perception of empathy-eliciting stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain.
   Design: In a case-control study, brain activation patterns elicited by dynamic stimuli depicting individuals being harmed and facial expressions of pain were compared between incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated controls.
   Setting: Participants were scanned on the grounds of a correctional facility using the Mind Research Network's mobile 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging system.
   Participants: Eighty incarcerated men were classified according to scores on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) as high (27 men; PCL-R, >= 30), inter-mediate (28 men; PCL-R, 21-29), or low (25 men; PCL-R, <= 20) levels of psychopathy.
   Main Outcome Measure: Neurohemodynamic response to empathy-eliciting dynamic scenarios revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Participants in the psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and peri-aqueductal gray relative to controls but showed greater activation in the insula, which was positively correlated with scores on both PCL-R factors 1 and 2.
   Conclusions and Relevance: In response to pain and distress cues expressed by others, individuals with psychopathy exhibit deficits in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex regardless of stimulus type and display selective impairment in processing facial cues of distress in regions associated with cognitive mentalizing. A better understanding of the neural responses to empathy-eliciting stimuli in psychopathy is necessary to inform intervention programs.

TI  - Security for Smart Mobile Networks: The NEMESYS Approach
T2  - 2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN MOBILE SYSTEMS (PRISMS)
CP  - International Conference on Privacy and Security in Mobile Systems (PRISMS)
AB  - The growing popularity of smart mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has made them an attractive target for cyber-criminals, resulting in a rapidly growing and evolving mobile threat as attackers experiment with new business models by targeting mobile users. With the emergence of the first large-scale mobile botnets, the core network has also become vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service attacks such as the signaling attack. Furthermore, complementary access methods such as Wi-Fi and femtocells introduce additional vulnerabilities for the mobile users as well as the core network. In this paper, we present the NEMESYS approach to smart mobile network security. The goal of the NEMESYS project is to develop novel security technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem, and to improve mobile network security through a better understanding of the threat landscape. To this purpose, NEMESYS will collect and analyze information about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting smart mobile devices and the core network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We are developing a data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots and honeyclients in order to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile attacks and understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile devices. By correlating the extracted information with known attack patterns from wireline networks, we plan to reveal and identify the possible shift in the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against smart mobile devices.

TI  - The Impact of Drug Market Pulling Levers Policing on Neighborhood Violence An Evaluation of the High Point Drug Market Intervention
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - Pulling levers policing draws upon the focused deterrence framework, which has shown considerable promise when directed at youth, gun, and gang offenders. However, much less is known about the viability of pulling levers when applied to different contexts as well as to diverse groups of offenders. We examine the High Point (North Carolina) Drug Market Intervention (DMI), the first site to use pulling levers as a place-based policing approach to disrupt a series of open-air drug markets across the city. Eleven years of longitudinal data are analyzed by using difference-in-difference panel regression analyses combined with finite mixture estimation as a means to test for divergence in violent crime patterns. Several key, although inconsistent, findings are presented. First, we found a statistically significant reduction in violent offenses in specific high-crime places (i.e., high-trajectory census blocks) located across the different targeted neighborhoods compared with the remainder of High Point, and relative to comparable nontargeted areas. Second, the citywide violent crime rate actually increased after a series of interventions unfolded, which may suggest limitations with the approach. Finally, trend analyses indicated the strategy had different levels of violent crime impact throughout unique geographic contexts.
   Policy Implications
   Rather than arresting every offender identified as having participated in illicit drug trafficking across various geographic contexts within the city, officials in High Point decided to invite low-risk drug offenders to community notification sessions in order to change their perceived risk of punishment as well as to mobilize community members across the different targeted neighborhoods. The suggestive evidence of potential, although limited, violent crime impact illustrates that this type of policing strategy may hold considerable promise. This interpretation gains credence when considered with prior evaluations of the DMI approach that illustrated the potential for reducing drug-related crime and in light of reports of improved police-community relations. The inconsistent findings across all locations and the overall city increase in violent crime toward the end of the study period, however, raise several concerns when interpreting study results. Additionally, our findings suggest that further replications should include systematic problem-identification, process measures, and more precise research designs.

TI  - Take the car keys away: Metropolitan structure and the long road to delinquency
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: This research fulfills a void in offender mobility discourse. Metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure, defined in crime pattern theory as the urban backcloth, plays a significant role in shaping travel behavior; and yet, current analysis of offender mobility continues to favor individual characteristics to account for travel range.
   Methods: Using a large sample of juveniles, both delinquent and at-risk youth (N=2,552), this study compared the predictive utility of individual characteristics against indicators of urban backcloth.
   Results: Delinquent youth were found to be more sensitive to the environmental conditions exerted by community-level socioeconomic characteristics than their at-risk counterparts. However, two factors-intercity hierarchical structure and motor vehicle access-accounted for travel variability among all youth.
   Conclusions: Offending behavior must be examined within the context of a dynamic environmental context formed by the metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure. Delinquents constitute an identifiable subgroup of youth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of differences in lipid A structure on TLR4 pro-inflammatory signaling and inflammasome activation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - The vertebrate immune system exists in equilibrium with the microbial world. The innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns via a family of Toll-like receptors (TLR) that activate cells upon detection of potential pathogens. Because some microbes benefit their hosts, mobilizing the appropriate response, and then controlling that response is critical in the maintenance of health. TLR4 recognizes the various forms of lipid A produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Depending on the structural form of the eliciting lipid A molecule, TLR4 responses range from a highly inflammatory endotoxic response involving inflammasome and other pro-inflammatory mediators, to an inhibitory, protective response. Mounting the correct response against an offending microbe is key to maintaining health when exposed to various bacterial species. Further study of lipid A variants may pave the way to understanding how TLR4 responses are generally able to avoid chronic inflammatory damage.

TI  - Popular Mobilization in Syria: Opportunity and Threat, and the Social Networks of the Early Risers
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS
AB  - This paper explores the dynamics and underlying conditions of the first few months of the uprising in Syria, from mid-March 2011 until the summer of that year. Together with the contributions from Dalmasso and Kandil, it exploits the opportunity created by the Arab uprisings to shed new light on patterns of social mobilization and collective action that research programmes focusing on authoritarian resilience had tended to overlook. Specifically, it presents an analysis that critically and loosely borrows from, communicates with and hopes to make a modest contribution to social movement theory (SMT). While threat and opportunity are necessary elements for popular mobilization, they are not sufficient. Both 'threat' and 'opportunity' therefore need to be contextualized within the specific social and political environment, real or perceived, of the 'early risers' in Syria, in order to appreciate their local significance. The article further argues that protestors, when under threat and faced with the opportunity, collectively rose up by capitalizing on their dense social networks. Strong clan-based or tribal social structures, circular labour migration, cross-border linkages and proliferating practices denoted as 'criminal' variably played a key role in cementing these social networks. It is also contended that these networks' ability easily to dissolve into one another due to their high degree of interconnectedness was instrumental in collective mobilization and their ability to pose a strong and enduring challenge to the regime.

TI  - Recruiting the 'martial races': identities and military service in colonial India
T2  - PATTERNS OF PREJUDICE
AB  - British rule in India was entirely reliant on local troops, and the mobilization and recruitment of Indian communities gave rise to a multiplicity of discourses, traditions and identities reflecting the peculiar relationship between colonial power and indigenous military labour. Through the late nineteenth century, these discourses became increasingly racialized: only certain native communities were deemed to possess the 'spirit' necessary for military service. These so-called 'martial races'-including Nepalese Gurkhas, Punjabi Sikhs and Muslims from the northern and frontier provinces-provided the backbone of the imperial military and played a vital role in defending and extending colonial authority. By the early twentieth century, the racialized nature of soldiering in India was invoked to explain the composition of imperial forces and to legitimize the preservation of colonial rule. While the theory of 'martial races' is the subject of an increasingly diverse literature, relatively little attention has been paid to the practice-and practical origins-of restricted recruitment. In this article Rand and Wagner seek to re-examine the role of martial-race theories in British recruitment policies and practices in colonial India, drawing attention to the incoherence and complexity that marked the relationship between ideas of race and the practicalities of colonial military administration. They focus in particular on long-term patterns of continuities, rather than neat periodizations, and suggest that racialized discourses regarding soldiering have to be considered within the context of mutually advantageous relationships between the colonial state and its indigenous allies.

TI  - LITIGATION AT WORK: DEFENDING DAY LABOR IN LOS ANGELES
T2  - UCLA LAW REVIEW
AB  - Local opposition to day laborers is built upon a standard diagnosis of the day labor "problem" and a common approach to its "remedy." The diagnosis views day labor as a public nuisance that imposes negative externalities on a locality by disrupting normal patterns of business, traffic, and pedestrian exchange. The remedy involves the enactment of new land use regulations, known as antisolicitation ordinances, designed to remove day laborers from the street corners-thereby undermining their ability to earn a living. Such ordinances regulate immigration indirectly by criminalizing conduct engaged in disproportionately by immigrant workers. Their proliferation, in turn, has invited a specific type of legal challenge focused on the deprivation of day laborers' First Amendment right to seek work. This Article examines a pivotal struggle in the national day labor movement: the two-decade long legal campaign to contest antisolicitation ordinances in the greater Los Angeles area. It asks whether and how litigation-often portrayed as a nemesis of social movements-has advanced the day laborers' cause. What it shows is that litigation has been an indispensible social change tool in the fight for day laborers' rights, albeit one that carries inherent risk. On the positive side of the ledger, the Los Angeles day labor campaign has drawn upon strong legal capacity to mobilize a rights strategy, coordinated with grassroots organizing, against the backdrop of limited political options. It has thus avoided many of the familiar pitfalls of social change litigation in successfully challenging key ordinances. Yet, despite its success in preserving public space for day labor solicitation, the campaign's outcome rests in the hands of a federal appellate court, underscoring a fundamental social change reality: Even the most sophisticated litigation campaign ultimately hinges on the presence of sympathetic decisionmakers in the court of ultimate authority.

TI  - THE SUCCESS OF THE CIVILIZATION OFFENSIVE: SOCIETAL ADAPTATION OF REFORMED BOYS IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY IN THE NETHERLANDS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
AB  - Societal adaptation after reform school was studied for almost 200 men born around 1900 in the Netherlands. The men came mostly from disadvantaged backgrounds: parents were ill-equipped to raise them, alcoholics, criminal or extremely poor. The men held significantly higher occupations than their father, and outperformed general upward social mobility. Their marriage chances were approximately normative; divorce chances were much increased. Almost half were delinquent and one in six was either a chronic or a serious criminal. Marriage and employment patterns were associated and were associated with childhood risk factors as well. Delinquency was predicted only by having a convicted father. We conclude that the civilization offensive was partly successful in that it mainly equipped these men for better than expected employment careers.

TI  - Vertebral artery pexy for microvascular decompression of the facial nerve in the treatment of hemifacial spasm
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB  - Object. Hemi facial spasm (HFS) is caused by arterial or venous compression of cranial nerve VII at its root exit zone. Traditionally, microvascular decompression of the facial nerve has been an effective treatment for posterior inferior and anterior inferior cerebellar artery as well as venous compression. The traditional technique involves Teflon felt or another construct to cushion the offending vessel from the facial nerve, or cautery and division of the offending vein. However, using this technique for severe vertebral artery (VA) compression can he ineffective and fraught with complications. The authors report the use of a new technique of VA pexy to the petrous or clival dura mater in patients with HFS attributed to a severely ectatic and tortuous VA. and detail the results in a series of patients.
   Methods. Six patients with I-IFS due to VA compression underwent a retrosigmoid craniotomy. combined with a far-lateral approach in some patients. On identification of the site of VA compression. the vessel was mobilized adequately for the decompression. Great care was taken to avoid kinking the perforating vessels arising from the VA. Two 8-0 nylon sutures were passed through to the wall of the VA and then through the diva! or petrous dura, and then tied to alleviate compression on cranial nerve VII.
   Results. Patients were followed for at least 1 year postoperatively (mean 2.7 years. range 1 4 years). All 6 patients had complete resolution of their HFS. Facial function was tested postoperatively. and was stable when compared with the preoperative baseline. Two of the 3 patients with preoperative Minims had resolution of this symptom after the procedure. Postoperative imaging demonstrated VA decompression of the facial nerve and no evidence of stroke in all patients. One patient suffered from hearing loss, another developed a postoperative transient unilateral vocal cord paralysis, and a third patient developed a pseudomeningocele that resolved with the placement of a lumbar drain.
   Conclusions. Hemifacial spasm and other neurovascular syndromes are effectively treated by repositioning the compressing artery. Careful study of the preoperative MR images may identify a select group of patients with I-IFS due to an ectatic VA. Rather than traditional decompression with only pledget placement, these patients may be from a VA pexy to provide an effective. safe. and durable resolution of their symptoms while minimizing surgical complications.

TI  - Predictive models of dissocial behavior by sexes in two low socioeconomic status neighborhoods
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - Although the characteristics of the adolescent stage favor the emergence of disruptive behaviors, not all adolescents engage in them in equal degree. For the majority of adolescents, the problematic behaviors are limited to an experimentation period and are temporary. However, for some individuals, the first contacts with the disruptive behavior progress to more severe antisocial behavior patterns. The progression of the dissocial behavior from the childhood to the adolescence seems related to a difficult temperament, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, improper relationships with peers, precocious sexuality, poor parent-adolescent communication, arrests by delinquency and repetition.
   Traditionally, the dissocial behavior has been associated with low socioeconomic status, lack of public services, unemployment, marginalization and schools with unsuitable educational programs. However, current conceptualizations view this problem as much more complex. In communities that have covered the basic needs, even in those that possess a good quality of life, we can find children and adolescents with dissocial behavior that thereinafter become adults with antisocial personality. Therefore, during the last decades, research has displaced its attention from the structural variables to community (lack of attachment with the vicinity, social mobility, and population density), family (bonding, communication, supervision) and personal processes, favoring a biopsychosocial perspective to this problem.
   The aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model of dissocial behavior (as defined by the 27-item Dissocial Behavior Scale, ECOD127) based on the following predictor variables: a) Parent communication (Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale, PACS), b) Empathy (Interpersonal Relationship Index, IRI), c) Assertiveness (Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, RAS), d) Sensation seeking (Sensation Seeking Scale Form V, SSS-V) and e) Risk socialization (Social Relationship Questionnaire, SRQ, created for this study) controlling for the impression management effect (Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding version 6, BIDR-6).
   Method
   A probability sample of adolescents, 14 to 17 years of age, living in two neighborhoods with high indexes of gangs and offenses was collected. Males were 112 and women 86, without statistical difference of frequencies (chi(2) [1, N=196]=3.41, p=.06). All participants resided in San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Pearson's product-moment correlation, partial correlation and stepwise linear regression were used for data analysis.
   Results
   There was a significant difference in dissocial behavior cases between male and female adolescents (chi(2) [1, N=194]=14.75, p<.00), with Yates' correction: (chi(2) [1, N=194]=12.59, p<.01). The percentage of cases is 18% in women and 45% in men.
   The total score of the 27-item Dissocial Behavior Scale (ECOD127) presented significant correlation with social desirability (.47 in men and 44 in women) and its factor of impression management (.53 in men and .47 in women). The self-deception factor was independent in men (r=.18, p=.06), but not in women (r=.26, p=.02). Higher dissocial behavior features were associated with lower scores on social desirability and its factors. The effect of the impression management factor had to be controlled for its statistical significance in men and women.
   Of the 18 variables of the social relationships questionnaire (SRQ) by the point-biserial correlation coefficient (dichotomic variables) and Pearson's product-moment correlation (ordinal and numerical variables), only four were significantly correlated to the ECOD127 total score: to belong (1) or not (2) to a gang outside of the school and job (n=193, r(pb)=.45, p<.01) and in the school (n=133, r(pb)=.35, p<.01), to have 1) or not 2) a friend group outside of the school and job (n=193, r(pb)=.20, p=.01), as well as to have 1) or not 2) a girlfriend or boyfriend in the school (n=131, r(pb)=.26, p=.02) and outside of the school and job (n=193, r(pb)=.18, p=.01). These correlations were positive, that is to say, acted as risk factors (lower score on ECOD127, more dissocial behavior). The variable of risk socialization was created with the sum of these five variables, giving more weight to the two variables of gangs by their higher correlations, so they are multiplied by two. The created variable has a range of 0 (not risk) to 7 (high risk).
   Of the 20 variables contemplated, nine presented significant correlation with dissocial behavior in men, after partializing the effect of he impression management: sensation seeking and its four factors (disinhibition, excitement seeking, emotion seeking and boredom susceptibility), risk socialization, total and open communication with the father and perspective taking. In women there were also nine significant variables: risk socialization, sensation seeking and its factors of disinhibition, boredom susceptibility and excitement seeking, total and open communication with the mother, total communication with the father and school grade.
   The regression models by sexes were calculated with the nine variables whose correlations with the ECOD127 total score resulted significant after partializing impression management.
   In men the calculation process ended in the fifth step. The model explained 49% of the variance of the ECOD127 total score and was significant (F[5, 106]=21.99, p<.01). Five variables integrated the model: disinhibition (beta=-.32), risk socialization (beta=-.28), open communication with the father (beta=.27), excitement seeking (beta=-.20) and perspective taking (beta=.16). In women the calculation process ended in the third step. The model explained 40% of the variance of the criterion and was significant (F[3, 78]=19.38, p<.01). Three variables integrated it: total communication with the mother (beta=.33), risk socialization (beta=-32) and sensation seeking (beta=-.28).
   Conclusions
   The results of the present study can only be extrapolated to the population of the two studied neighborhoods and must be handled as generators of testable hypotheses in other similar populations. In addition, their self-report nature must be considered as an additional potential limitation. However, they indicate that the presence of dissocial behavior was high in the present sample, with an intermediate percentage (33%) between high school students (8.5%) and imprisoned offenders (50%). Risk socialization (engaging in gangs, friend group in the neighborhood and precocious sexuality), sensation seeking and little communication with the parent or tutor of the same sex than adolescent in men and women, as well as lack of perspective taking in men, were predictors of dissocial behavior. The sensation seeking was defined in the regression models by the SSS total score in women and by its factors of disinhibition and excitement seeking in men.
   These data make an attention call to the Council authorities of a propitiatory environment for dissocial behavior. From the obtained models, the intervention must be addressed to eradicate the phenomenon of the gangs; to encourage the internal control or planning and perspective taking in the pupils, through specific workshops within the school subjects of ethic or health care. They also call for the importance to work the open communication, above all with the parent or tutor of the same sex than the adolescent, through these workshops as well as during the meetings with the pupil's parents. Furthermore, to seek occupational-formative opportunities for those adolescents that have left the school seems critical, especially for those of 16-year-old or younger, considering the prohibition of working at that age.

TI  - REASSESSING TRENDS IN BLACK VIOLENT CRIME, 1980-2008: SORTING OUT THE "HISPANIC EFFECT" IN UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS ARRESTS, NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY OFFENDER ESTIMATES, AND US PRISONER COUNTS
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Recent studies suggest a decline in the relative Black effect on violent crime in recent decades and interpret this decline as resulting from greater upward mobility among African Americans during the past several decades. However, other assessments of racial stratification in American society suggest at least as much durability as change in Black social mobility since the 1980s. Our goal is to assess how patterns of racial disparity in violent crime and incarceration have changed from 1980 to 2008. We argue that prior studies showing a shrinking Black share of violent crime might be in error because of reliance on White and Black national crime statistics that are confounded with Hispanic offenders, whose numbers have been increasing rapidly and whose violence rates are higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks. Using 1980-2008 California and New York arrest data to adjust for this "Hispanic effect" in national Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data, we assess whether the observed national decline in racial disparities in violent crime is an artifact of the growth in Hispanic populations and offenders. Results suggest that little overall change has occurred in the Black share of violent offending in both UCR and NCVS estimates during the last 30 years. In addition, racial imbalances in arrest versus incarceration levels across the index violent crimes are both small and comparably sized across the study period. We conclude by discussing the consistency of these findings with trends in economic and social integration of Blacks in American society during the past 50 years.

TI  - Guideline Development of Mobile Phone Design for Preventing Child Abuse
T2  - HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN (HCD)
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Human Centered Design (HCD)/14th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
AB  - This paper is studied to develop a guideline of mobile phone design that protects a child from crimes. It is studied that the criminal commits crimes through the three steps of 1) approach, 2) attract, and 3) plunder - movement. Through this research, it was found that the child's recognition of the criminal situation could prevent the child from crimes. Because of limitations of child's cognition, this study is conducted to provide diverse solutions that could notify abnormal signs to the guardians using a mobile phone, even when the child has no awareness of the situation. In addition, the patterns of the child's usual route and walking speed are logged for detecting the criminal situation. This feature enables the guardians to intervene the crime. A design guideline for developing hardware and applications of a mobile phone is suggested through case analysis and expert interviews.

TI  - Policing mobile criminality: implications for police forces in the UK
T2  - POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider how the national intelligence model (NIM) of policing in Britain has been affected by changing patterns of mobility, since its inception in 2004.
   Design/methodology/approach - Conceptually, the paper draws on the "new mobilities paradigm". Empirically, it is based on a small, exploratory study, comprising analysis of investigations carried out over a three-month period in 2007 and 2008, by a serious and organised crime unit in a police force in England, and 11 interviews carried out in three police forces in England. The data are used for illustrative purposes only.
   Findings - It is argued that increased levels of mobile criminality are impacting significantly on British police forces, placing considerable strain on the practical structures which underpin the NIM, and posing serious challenges to operational efficiency and effectiveness.
   Originality/value - This paper makes a contribution by linking the social changes documented in the emergent social science field of "mobilities study" with changes in the organisation of criminality, particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality, which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational as well as "lower level" crime. Examining this phenomenon enables us to see that despite the attention paid to transnational policing in the organised crime literature, the burden of policing both organised and opportunistic crime continues to fall upon local police forces.

TI  - Contesting Europe: the constitutive impact of discursive dynamics on national referendum campaigns
T2  - EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB  - A comparison of two referendum campaigns on Europe in France and Ireland shows two different patterns of mobilisation. Focusing on the perceived influence of the European treaties on national legislation on abortion, two different types of Euro-scepticism can be discerned. One is settled in a potentially universal project of 'enlightenment' (fearing the 'criminalisation' of abortion due to EU (European Union) regulations), the other is concerned with the defence of the nation's democratic sovereignty against the EU (and fears 'liberalisation' of abortion due to the same EU regulations). A discourse analysis of these two different settings establishes the 'discursive dynamics' of each campaign: How were actors constituted (into 'legitimate' actors) and how could the (differing) interpretations of EU treaty provisions become plausible and constitute into different national discourses? Instead of perceiving social variables (norms, rules, identities) as 'independent' factors that explain outcomes, the social process of their constitution is at the centre of this analysis. Understanding how and when certain actors and certain topics (or problematiques) come into being (are 'constituted') may, in turn, allow some 'reasoned claims' on the character of popular Euro-scepticism.

TI  - Childhood predictors of adult substance abuse
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - Identification of the early determinants of substance abuse is a major focus of life course research. In this study, we investigated the child, family, and school-related antecedents of the onset and prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 for a cohort of 1208 low-income minority children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Data on well-being have been collected prospectively since birth from administrative records, parents, teachers, and children. Results indicated that the prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 was 26% (self-reports or criminal justice system records) with a median age of first use of 17. Probit regression analysis indicated that substance abuse prevalence was primarily determined by gender (males had a higher rate), trouble-making behavior by age 12, school mobility, and previous substance use. Family and peer predictors included involvement in the child welfare system by age 9, parent expectations for school success at age 9, parent substance abuse by child's age 15, and deviant peer affiliation by age 16. Age of first substance use was predicted by gender and race/ethnicity (males and Blacks had earlier incidence), involvement in the child welfare system, and family risk status at age 8. As with prevalence, the pattern of predictors for males was similar to the overall sample but the magnitude of effects was stronger. The predictors of the timing of substance use dependency were gender, family conflict by age 5, involvement in the child welfare system, social maturity at age 9, adolescent school mobility, and school dropout by age 16. Findings indicate that the promotion of family involvement and positive school and social behaviors can reduce the risk of substance abuse. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Investigating mobility patterns for repetitive sexual contact in adult child sex offending
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - In the present study, geographic mobility exhibited by child sex offenders was examined. Geographic mobility was defined as the use of multiple locations to obtain repetitive sexual contact with the same victim. The sample consisted of 77 adult offenders convicted for having committed a sexual offence against a child, and who agreed to provide confidential self-report data concerning their offending behaviours. Based on a set of offence characteristics, offenders who used a single location were compared to offenders who used multiple locations for sexual contact. Results showed that offenders who used multiple locations are more likely to isolate the victim, use violence, involve the victim in several sexual episodes, abuse the victim for a period exceeding one year, and make the victim participate and perform sexual behaviours on them during sexual episodes. Examining more closely offenders who used multiple locations for abuse, three offence patterns were further identified (i.e., familial-low mobility offence, non familial-high mobility offence, and familial-high mobility offence). Going for a car ride was also found to be a common location/situation used in the familial-low mobility offence subgroup, while the use of outdoor locations on a regular basis was found to be rare in high mobility patterns subgroups.

TI  - Sexual Predators, Energy Development, and Conservation in Greater Yellowstone
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - In the United States, as elsewhere, a growing debate pits national energy policy and homeland security against biological conservation. In rural communities the extraction of fossil fuels is often encouraged because of the employment opportunities it offers, although the concomitant itinerant workforce is often associated with increased wildlife poaching. We explored possible positive and negative factors associated with energy extraction in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), an area known for its national parks, intact biological diversity, and some of the New World's longest terrestrial migrations. Specifically, we asked whether counties with different economies-recreation (ski), agrarian (ranching or farming), and energy extractive (petroleum)-differed in healthcare (gauged by the abundance of hospital beds) and in the frequency of sexual predators. The absolute and relative frequency of registered sex offenders grew approximately two to three times faster in areas reliant on energy extraction. Healthcare among counties did not differ. The strong conflation of community dishevel, as reflected by in-migrant sexual predators, and ecological decay in Greater Yellowstone is consistent with patterns seen in similar systems from Ecuador to northern Canada, where social and environmental disarray exist around energy boomtowns. In our case, that groups (albeit with different aims) mobilized campaigns to help maintain the quality of rural livelihoods by protecting open space is a positive sign that conservation can matter, especially in the face of rampant and poorly executed energy extraction projects. Our findings further suggest that the public and industry need stronger regulatory action to instill greater vigilance when and where social factors and land conversion impact biological systems.

TI  - Probabilistic Vehicular Trace Reconstruction Based on RF-Visual Data Fusion
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS AND MULTIMEDIA SECURITY, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 11th IFIP International Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security
AB  - Geolocation information is not only crucial in conventional crime investigation, but also increasingly important for digital forensics as it allows for the logical fusion of digital evidence that is often fragmented across disparate mobile assets. This, in turn, often requires the reconstruction of mobility patterns. However, real-time surveillance is often difficult and costly to conduct, especially in criminal scenarios where such process needs to take place clandestinely. In this paper, we consider a vehicular tracking scenario and we propose an offline post hoc vehicular trace reconstruction mechanism that can accurately reconstruct vehicular mobility traces of a target entity by fusing the corresponding available visual and radio-frequency surveillance data. The algorithm provides a probabilistic treatment to the problem of incomplete data by means of Bayesian inference. In particular, we realize that it is very likely that a reconstructed route of a target entity will contain gaps (due to missing trace data), so we try to probabilistically fill these gaps. This allows law enforcement agents to conduct off-line tracking while characterizing the quality of available evidence.

TI  - Education and social (in)justice for mobile groups: re-framing rights and educational inclusion for Indian pastoralist children
T2  - EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
AB  - Social exclusion is not random, but concentrated in already marginalised groups and often related to the ofrozen accidentso of particular forms of thinking about education and development that come to dominate policy and strategies for service provision. This paper examines how accessing the recently enacted right to education raises a range of justice concerns for mobile, and particularly transhumant pastoralist, children in India. It argues that provision of formal education reflects institutionalised patterns of economic discrimination and status inequality that deny such children what Nancy Fraser terms oparticipatory parityo. The policy norm of habitation-based provision fails to fulfil the rights criteria of making schooling available and accessible, while the colonial criminalisation of mobility leaves an enduring legacy of discrimination. Formal education is complex and contradictory in relation to both moral dimensions of the human right and its contribution to social justice.

TI  - E<SUP>3</SUP>TP: A Novel Trajectory Prediction Algorithm in Moving Objects Databases
T2  - INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - Pacific Asia Workshop on Intelligence and Security Informatics (PAISI 2009)
AB  - Prediction of uncertain trajectories in moving objects databases has recently become a new paradigm for tracking wireless and mobile devices in an accurate and efficient manner, and is critical in law enforcement applications such as criminal tracking analysis. However, existing approaches for prediction in spatio-temporal databases focus on either mining frequent sequential patterns at a certain geographical position, or constructing kinematical models to approximate real-world routes. The former overlooks the fact that movement patterns of objects are most likely to be local, and constrained in some certain region, while the later fails to take into consideration some important factors, e.g., population distribution, and the structure of traffic networks. To cope with those problems, we propose a general trajectory prediction algorithm called (ETP)-T-3 (an Effective, Efficient, and Easy Trajectory Prediction algorithm), which contains four main phases: (i) mining "hotspot" regions from moving objects databases; (ii) discovering frequent sequential routes in hotspot areas; (iii) computing the speed of a variety of moving objects; and (N) predicting the dynamic motion behaviors of objects. Experimental results demonstrate that (ETP)-T-3 is an efficient and effective algorithm for trajectory prediction, and the prediction accuracy is about 30% higher than the naive approach. In addition, it is easy-to-use in real-world scenarios.

TI  - Household exposure to violence and human rights violations in western Bangladesh (I): prevalence, risk factors and consequences
T2  - BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
AB  - Background: The ruling parties in Bangladesh have systematically used violence against political opponents and criminals. It is essential to 1) determine the magnitude and burden of organised crime and political violence (OPV) and human rights violations in the affected community, and to 2) identify the risk factors and key indicators for developing effective health intervention and prevention measures.
   Methods: The population-based study consisted of two parts: a household survey and OPV screening at mobile clinics (presented in Part II). A cross-sectional, multistage cluster household survey was conducted in the Meherpur district in February-March 2008; 22 clusters with a sample size of 1,101 households (population of 4,870) were selected.
   Results: Around 83% of households reported being exposed to at least two categories of OPV or human rights violations: 29% reported that the family members had been arrested or detained; 31% reported torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Crude mortality rate was 17.9/1,000 and under 5 mortality rate was 75/1,000. The annual injury rate was 36%, lifetime experience of violence-related injury was 50%, and pain experience within 2 weeks was reported by 57%. Over 80% of the population over 35 years old complained of pain. High prevalence of injury, lifetime experience of OPV-related injury and pain complaints are related to the level of exposure to OPV and human rights violations. A financial burden was imposed on families with an injured person. A geographical variation was revealed regarding reports of torture and lifetime experience of violence-related injury. A combination of individual, relational, community and societal factors, including variables such as political party affiliation, conflict with other families, household income and residential area, affected the risk of victimisation in the household. The odds ratio for reporting extrajudicial execution of a family member was 9.22 for Awami League supporters, 9.15 for Bangladesh Nationalist Party supporters; and 3.97 for Jamaat-e-Islami Party supporters compared with families with no political involvement.
   Conclusion: The level of violence and human rights violations is high. The affected population suffers from violence-related injuries and traumas, which could be a factor contributing to poverty. Victimisation is not random.

TI  - The Great Cut: The Support for Private Modes of Social Evasion by Public Policy
T2  - SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
AB  - The counterpart city represents an attempt to conceptualize the hidden spaces inhabited by social problems and 'problem' people who are counter to the mainstream, or included, modes of contemporary urban social life. This 'opposite', or negative, space comprises the spatially withdrawn and socially excluded who are largely outside the purview of the comfortable classes of the same cities. Not only has residential segregation been sustained over recent decades, so too have mobile circuits of mutual exclusion been created, which enable higher-income groups to avoid the associated negative externalities of poverty (visibility, disorder, aggression and so on). As responsibility for dealing with social risks has become devolved to the level of the household, the desire for social evasion, as politicians, media systems and welfare patterns mark out threatening territories, has become more evident. The counterpart city is shunned in ever more elaborate ways and with the support of public policies. As the 'spatial' social policies, housing and urban, have become increasingly criminalized in the focus of their agendas, such interventions expend energy to facilitate this separation between affluent and poor. Traditional imperatives for public intervention are diminished as poverty has become more concealed from affluence - its costs and impacts evaded by technologies, socio-spatial circuits and policies that skirt those who are locked into places of poverty and abject marginality, a constellation of social forces and effects I term the great cut.

TI  - Organized fraud and organizing frauds: <i>Unpacking research on networks and organization</i>
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY & CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - This article examines the settings for frauds in the context of crime networks, fraud opportunities and of a victim-centric typology of fraud. It demonstrates the variety of actors, settings and the variable need for knowing collaboration between co-offenders in frauds of different types. It explores what is known about those involved in the organization of some forms of frauds; how they find both co-offenders and victims in face-to-face and remote settings; and the barriers to growth of the 'fraud business'. It concludes that the globalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between settings, with their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns of business, consumer and investment activities), the variable abilities of would-be perpetrators to recognize and act on those opportunities (the 'crime scripts' perspective), and their interactions with controls (including, but not restricted to, law enforcement). Constructs of 'organized crime' are becoming less obsessed with the structure of groups than with what people need from the largely illicit and largely licit worlds before they commit fraud. Although some frauds are committed by generic transnational 'organized crime' networks, others are merely mobile small groups or individuals who can transplant techniques wherever they go; and others still commit very large one-off frauds without a need for long-term or any involvement in 'organized crime'.

TI  - Crime and punishment in the "American dream"
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS
AB  - We observe that countries where belief in the "American dream"(i.e., effort pays) prevails also set harsher punishment for criminals. We know that beliefs are also correlated with several features of the economic system (taxation, social insurance, etc). Our objective is to study the joint determination of these three features (beliefs, punitiveness and economic system) in a way that replicates the observed empirical patterns. We present a model where beliefs determine the types of contracts that firms offer and whether workers exert effort. Some workers become criminals, depending on their luck in the labor market, the expected punishment, and an individual shock that we call "meanness". It is this meanness level that a penal system based on "retribution" tries to detect when deciding the severity of the punishment. We find that when initial beliefs differ, two equilibria can emerge out of identical fundamentals. In the "American" (as opposed to the "French") equilibrium, belief in the "American dream" is commonplace, workers exert effort, there are high powered contracts (and income is unequally distributed) and punishments are harsh. Economists who believe that deterrence (rather than retribution) shapes punishment can interpret the meanness parameter as pessimism about future economic opportunities and verify that two similar equilibria emerge.

TI  - Mobility, control and criminality in early colonial India, 1760s-1850s
T2  - INDIAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY REVIEW
AB  - The article looks into the ways certain mobile groups like the banjaras, gosains, fakirs and sanyasis were 'criminalised' by the colonial state between the periods of the 1760s and 1850s. Historiographically, the article argues for looking at the early colonial period more closely than has hitherto been done to understand the changing material and circulatory regimes in which these peripatetic groups operated. Unlike the current historiographical convention, which would explain crime as the artefact of a paranoid colonial mind-set, this article traces criminality to the disruption in prevailing patterns of trade and transport, and the livelihoods supported by them, consequent to colonial settlement and, in this region (eastern India), the rise of the kingdom of Nepal.

TI  - The physiology of willpower: Linking blood glucose to self-control
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Past research indicates that self-control relies on some sort of limited energy source. This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.

AB  - We present a family of algorithms to uncover tribes-groups of individuals who share unusual sequences of affiliations. While much work inferring community structure describes large-scale trends, we instead search for small groups of tightly linked individuals who behave anomalously with respect to those trends. We apply the algorithms to a large temporal and relational data set consisting of millions of employment records from the National Association of Securities Dealers. The resulting tribes contain individuals at higher risk for fraud, are homogenous with respect to risk scores, and are geographically mobile, all at significant levels compared to random or to other sets of individuals who share affiliations.

T2  - O3A: OPTICS FOR ARTS, ARCHITECTURE, AND ARCHAEOLOGY
CP  - O3A - Optics for Arts, Architecture, and Archaeology Conference
AB  - A new mobile optical 3D measurement system using phase correlation based fringe projection technique will be presented. The sensor consist of a digital projection unit and two cameras in a stereo arrangement, whereby both are battery powered. The data transfer to a base station will be done via WLAN. This gives the possibility to use the system in complicate, remote measurement situations, which are typical in archaeology and architecture. In the measurement procedure the sensor will be hand-held by the user, illuminating the object with a sequence of less than 10 fringe patterns, within a time below 200 ins. This short sequence duration was achieved by a new approach, which combines the epipolar constraint with robust phase correlation utilizing a pre-calibrated sensor head, containing two cameras and a digital fringe projector.
   Furthermore, the system can be utilized to acquire the all around shape of objects by using the phasogram-metric approach with virtual land marks introduced by the authors(1,2). This way no matching procedures or markers are necessary for the registration of multiple views, which makes the system very flexible in accomplishing 0 different measurement tasks. The realized measurement field is approx. 100 mm tip to 400 mm in diameter.
   The mobile character makes the measurement system useful for a wide range of applications in arts, architecture, archaeology and criminology, which will be shown in the paper.

TI  - Diet, mobility, and settlement pattern among Holocene hunter-gatherers in southernmost Africa
T2  - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - Integration of new biological information ( stable isotope analyses of archaeological human skeletons) with the archaeological sequence of southernmost Africa and with wider sociocultural studies of hunters and gatherers shows that between 4,500 and 2,000 BP coastal hunter-gatherers buried on the Robberg Peninsula and adjacent Plettenberg Bay ate large quantities of high-trophic-level marine protein. This contrasts with more mixed diets reflected in skeletons from Matjes River Rock Shelter, only 14 km along the shore. Assuming that the burials represent the populations that inhabited the sites, such clear economic separation could have come about only if these were two separate groups of people who lived in clearly demarcated, mutually exclusive territories. Such a settlement pattern directly contradicts ethnographic studies of southern African hunter-gatherers, all derived from inland areas. Later Stone Age material culture, including the assemblages from these sites, shows many similarities to that of twentieth-century Kalahari foragers, but settlement pattern and social organization were sometimes very different.

T2  - 2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE ADHOC AND SENSOR SYSTEMS, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems
AB  - Unlike in conventional networks, node positions in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) usually change over time. As a side effect of managing routes, routing protocols to some extent also disseminate neighborship and topology information in the network, thereby disclosing at least some information on a node's own position to other nodes. Due to the wireless nature of ad hoc networks, this information can become available even to third parties which are not participating in the network. Using this information, location profiting may become possible, where attackers gather information on node positions or mobility patterns. This information may then be used for anything ranging from targeted advertisement to criminal activities. Therefore, location privacy is an important issue in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we analyze to what extent an attacker can track the precise location of a node, assuming a powerful attacker model where an attacker knows all neighbor relationships plus information on node distances. We present a new approach which uses these information and uses geometric constraints and heuristics to find node positions efficiently. The quality of our results is discussed and compared to other approaches. Based on the localization precision that such an "omniscient" attacker can reach, we will be able to evaluate the quality of future, more realistic attack models.

TI  - The political psychology of race
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - As both everyday experience and a wealth of social-scientific data attest, race continues to play an important role in conditioning not only individuals ' life outcomes, but also their social and political attitudes (Dawson, 1994; Kinder & Winter, 2001; Sears, Hetts, Sidanius, & Bobo, 2000; Tate, 1993). In particular, it is clear that identifications and preferences often thought of as purely " political" have become increasingly saturated with racial meaning (Carmines & Stimson, 1989; Glaser, 1996; Huckfeldt & Kohfeld, 1989; see also Gilens, 1999; Mendelberg, 2001), and that conflicts between racial groups and conflicts over racial issues have become more and more central to the main axes of political conflict in the United States and other societies.
   The purpose of this symposium is to bring together the contributions of five young scholars doing important work on the psychological dimensions of the intersection between race and politics. While this nexus also has critical historical and institutional dimensions (Huckfeldt & Kohfeld, 1989; see also Mendelberg, 2001), political psychology is uniquely positioned to analyze the linkage between race and politics. Perhaps the most important contribution of political psychology in this area has to do with matters of social identity - or to be more precise, attachments to racial ingroups and ingroup- related social institutions, on one hand, and resentments toward racial outgroups, on the other (Kinder & Winter, 2001; Tajfel & Turner, 1986). Simply put, a variety of research suggests that racial-group attachments and resentments are primary psychological antecedents of both White and Black Americans ' attitudes toward social policies with explicit and implicit racial content (see Sears, 1988; Sears, Hetts, Sidanius, & Bobo, 2000; see also Gilens, 1999). In turn, identity- related variables may provide an essential link between broad social and historical factors - such as the cultural values of a particular society, or the ways its institutions condition and regulate intergroup competition for power and material resources - and the political behavior of individuals. This psychological focus on attachment and resentment has played a particularly important role in making sense of the growing intersection between race and ostensibly nonracial identifications and preferences. For example, an important line of research has examined the growth of covert links between attitudes toward African Americans and various "race- coded" issues (Gilens, 1999; Mendelberg, 2001). This body of work suggests that White resentment toward African Americans has become a strong predictor of support for punitive social policies in the domains of social welfare and criminal justice and that these resentments may provide a crucial psychological link between biases in media coverage and elite discourse, on one hand, and White individuals ' actual political attitudes and behaviors, on the other (see esp. Gilens, 1999). Elsewhere, largescale analyses have suggested that intergroup differences in the valence and intensity of these resentments - along with ingroup attachments - may account for a large portion of the "racial divide" in public opinion about racial and nonracial matters alike (Kinder & Winter, 2001).
   Race-related social identifications also appear to play a role in various forms of political involvement and participatory behavior. One of the simplest of these involvements is party identification or a psychological attachment to a political party that transcends voting behavior (Campbell, Converse, Miller, & Stokes, 1960). In studies of race and politics, an enduring theme is the role of racial identity and group- interest perceptions in the development of African Americans ' ties to the major political parties. Work in this area suggests that a strong sense of "linked fate" with other African Americans - coupled with the enduring historical role of race in conditioning access to power and resources in American society - leads Blacks from a variety of class backgrounds to form party attachments on the basis of how well different parties pursue shared Black interests (e. g., Dawson, 1994). The operation of this principle can be seen in the longstanding attachment of African Americans to the Democratic Party. While African Americans initially gravitated toward the Democratic Party for economic reasons during the New Deal era (Weiss, 1983), the migration of Black voters from the South to the North created the necessity for the Democratic Party to adopt race-based platforms in order to win elections in Northern urban areas (Carmines & Stimson, 1989). Subsequently, the Democrats ' commitment to and successful passage of critical civil- rights legislation solidified a pattern of Black support of the Democratic party which continues to this day.
   At the same time, social ties and identifications associated with the Black church continue to be an important force in Black political socialization and participation. In addition to imparting community values and bonds, the church helps distribute political information, teaches political skills, and encourages norms of political activity (Calhoun- Brown, 1996; Tate, 1993; Verba, Schlozman, & Brady, 1995). In particular, as a political organization the church is uniquely able to mobilize by creating "selective social incentives" for those who participate in the political activities that it encourages (Rosenstone & Hansen, 1993). Thus, political psychology has made a variety of important contributions to our understanding of the linkage between race and politics. Moreover, in doing so, it has not merely supplemented other approaches: Rather, it has made the examination of psychological processes and constructs a central part of inquiry in this area without ignoring broader historical and institutional aspects of the race- and- politics interface. The five contributions which make up this symposium - all offered by young scholars currently at the forefront of work in this area - exemplify this mode of analysis. Three of the contributions focus primarily on the effects of racial attitudes, cues, and identifications on political attitudes among Whites, while the other two focus on the connection between race- related social attachments and various forms of political mobilization (e. g., party identification, political activism, etc.) among African Americans.
   The first contribution is offered by Christine Reyna, Amanda Tucker, William Korfmacher, and P. J. Henry, who examine the differing beliefs of supporters and opponents of affirmative action. Taking their cue from earlier work on the different frames used in elite discussions of affirmative- action policy, Reyna and her colleagues argue that supporters of affirmative action may think of the policy in terms of its " merit- upholding" applications (e. g., making special efforts to recruit members of underrepresented groups), while opponents may think of it in terms of " merit-violating" applications (e. g., quotas). Using data from two Chicago-area samples, they find a strong pattern of support for this hypothesis. However, they also find that both supporters and opponents of affirmative action show more support for merit-upholding than merit-violating applications of the policy. Additional analyses indicate that a similar pattern can be found among respondents with different attitudes toward African Americans. As the authors note, these findings suggest that supporters and opponents of this highly controversial policy may actually share more common ground than is often admitted.
   From a very different perspective, Christopher Federico addresses another policy-related topic: the relationship between negative perceptions of African Americans and attitudes toward welfare. As a number of studies have suggested, negative perceptions of African Americans are strongly related to hostility toward welfare among Whites, particularly in the presence of racial cues (e. g., Gilens, 1999). Nevertheless, a long line of research on the liberalizing effects of education suggests that these effects might be weaker among college-educated Whites. Taking issue with this interpretation, Federico argues that the role of education may be more complex. While education should lead to an increased awareness of tolerant norms, reducing the overall prevalence of negative racial perceptions, it should also lead to higher levels of cognitive ability, thereby strengthening the relationship between these perceptions and policy attitudes. Consistent with this argument, Federico shows that racial cues are more-rather than less-likely to strengthen the relationship between negative racial perceptions and evaluative responses to welfare among college-educated Whites. This strongly suggests a need to reconsider the assumption that education inevitably weakens the influence of intolerant attitudes and racially tinged environmental cues. Rather than focusing specifically on attitudes toward racial groups and racerelated policy issues, Cara Wong and Grace E. Cho take a step back and examine a potentially important antecedent of these attitudes: White racial identification. In contrast to approaches which have downplayed the role and even the existence of White racial identity, their analyses of data from eight different National Election Studies conclude that about half of American Whites do feel some sense of racial identification. Validating the significance of this identification pattern, Wong and Cho find that White identification relates to racial attitudes among Whites in much the same way as Black identification does among African Americans: White identification leads to more positive feelings about Whites and slightly more negative feelings about African Americans among Whites, while Black identification leads to more positive feelings about African Americans and an inconsistent pattern of feelings about Whites among African Americans. However, despite the apparent reality of White racial identification, they find that closeness to the White ingroup is only weakly related to Whites ' actual policy attitudes. Thus, Wong and Cho ' s work suggests that social identity may be relevant not just to the attitudes of minority groups, but also to the attitudes of majority groups often assumed to have no real sense of attachment to the ingroup.
   As noted above, the other two contributors examine the connection between race-related social attachments and political identification and engagement among African Americans. Harwood McClerking and Eric McDaniel explore the continuing importance of the church in mobilizing political participation among African Americans. In this effort, they go beyond traditional studies of the role of black churches that focus on their ability to educate, impart political skills, and develop norms for political behavior. Instead, they focus on the specific activities within churches that encourage participation. More importantly, their model acknowledges heterogeneity among political churches; some churches engage in activities that are more likely to promote participation than others do. In particular, the authors assert that churches with activities that underwrite the costs of participation and churches or that create obligations to participate are more successful in mobilizing their members. To test this theory, they analyze the effects of a number of types of church activities on both political and nonpolitical participation. Interestingly, and corresponding with their hypothesis about the power of creating obligations, communication between congregation members appears to have as great an effect on participation as direction from clergy members does.
   Finally, Samantha Luks and Laurel Elms address a related issue in race and politics: the dynamics of black party identification. As it has been well documented, the overwhelming majority of blacks have supported Democratic candidates (Tate, 1993; Miller & Shanks, 1996). However, they note that in the years since the Civil Rights movement, African Americans have become less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to call themselves independents or say they identify with no political party at all. They argue that one force behind the changing partisan composition of blacks is generational replacement. As the portion of the black population who did not directly experience the Civil Rights movement grows larger, African Americans as a group have become less strongly Democratic. To isolate the effects of generational replacement, the authors estimate an age-period-cohort model on a series of over 200 public opinion surveys ranging from 1973 to 1994. Additionally, they examine variables that can be considered sources of partisan differences caused by age, period, and cohort effects and examine the forces of regional and economic trends on the partisan composition of African Americans.
   In sum, the papers gathered here represent the cutting edge of contemporary work on the psychological dimensions of the interface between race and politics. In addition to appreciating the psychological constructs relevant to this interface as important variables in their own right, the perspectives which follow also take care to link these constructs to the broader social, historical, and institutional contexts in which intergroup relations are actually enacted. In doing so, they provide an excellent and more general example of how the uniquely interdisciplinary approach associated with political psychology can enrich our understanding of problems in a particular domain.

TI  - The influence of purchase price and ownership levels on theft targets - The example of domestic burglary
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - In this paper, we use police recorded crime data and purchase price information to investigate patterns in property stolen during domestic burglaries. We test the hypotheses that frequently stolen items are 'CRAVED' (Clarke 1999) and that the levels at which items are stolen vary over time, according to a product's position in the consumer goods life cycle of innovation, growth, mass market, saturation (Felson and Clarke 1998). We focus on audio-visual equipment and mobile telephones, comparing the trends with those for cash. The results show that the prevalence of theft of the products considered has changed significantly over the period studied, consistent with the life cycle hypothesis. The crime prevention implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for further research considered.

TI  - Traveling to violence: The case for a mobility-based spatial typology of homicide
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - According to routine activities theorem crime is the result of an intersection between victims and offenders in both time and space. We introduce a spatial typology that identifies five combinations of victim and offender mobility to homicide incident locations: internal, predatory, intrusion, offense mobility, and total mobility types. The authors' argue that the joint mobility pattern of the victim and offender is the mechanism underlying routine activities theory, and made explicit by the spatial typology. Using information on the 420 homicides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between 1987 and 1995, we demonstrate that the majority of homicides involve at least some mobility oil the part of victims and/or offenders. Our results also indicate that mobility to homicide incident locations is most associated with event characteristics such as motive, rather than with characteristics of the participants. With most offenders committing the homicide outside of their own neighborhood, levels of lethal violence in a community are influenced more by the interaction among nonlocal participants than by the violent actions of local residents.

AB  - The system for person facial identification based on mobile devices and the remote server application is considered. The existing system allows taking the facial portrait of the unknown person in real environment by the PDA and digital camera, sending photo to the remote server and obtaining results of the recognition to the PDA screen. The recognition is performed by the neural network model implemented as the core engine of the CGI application. The CGI executables work with the SQL-based database containing all necessary visual and textual information. The considered system is now utilized by a number of police departments in Russia and supports the operative criminal investigations in cases of existing information from witnesses and suspected person identification.

TI  - Getting away with the stolen vehicle: An investigation of journey-after-crime
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
AB  - Analyses of criminals' travel patterns can provide significant suggestions to improve crime management. This study extends the investigation of criminals' travel behavior from journey-to-crime to journey-after-crime. Moreover, new methods are developed to examine the spatial patterns of location pairs when restricted by the underlying geographical process. The methods are employed to investigate criminals' journey-after-auto-theft in the city of Buffalo, New York. The analyses reveal that auto thieves' trips from vehicle-theft locations to the corresponding vehicle-recovery locations are local in nature. The travel distances are significantly shorter than the randomly simulated trips; the travel directions are biased from the random directions as well.

TI  - The racial and ethnic typification of crime and the criminal typification of race and ethnicity in local television news
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Local news programming from three television stations in Orlando, Florida was analyzed for racial and ethnic content in relation to crime. The data show that Blacks are not overrepresented among TV news suspects relative to their proportion in the population or among those arrested in Orlando. Hispanics are slightly overrepresented in relation to their numbers in the population. Qualitatively, Blacks and especially Hispanics who appear as crime suspects do so in more threatening contexts than Whites. Blacks are more likely to appear as criminal suspects than as victims or positive role models, but this pattern is especially amplified for Hispanics. These results suggest that local TV news may contribute to the social construction of threat in relation to Blacks and Hispanics, a condition that is associated with fear of crime, "modern racism," and the mobilization of various social controls anti exclusions.

TI  - SPARTA -: A mobile agent based intrusion detection system
T2  - ADVANCES IN NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS SECURITY
CP  - 1st Annual Working Conference on Network Security
AB  - The large number of machines with different operating systems and applications in an enterprise network makes it very difficult for the system administrator to close all security holes and install the latest OS and software patches. When the network is connected to the Internet and services are remotely available they become a potential target for hackers, As the number of security related incidents is constantly increasing at an alarming rate the need for automated tools to detect intrusions becomes evident. Such tools are called intrusion detection systems.
   We present Sparta, a system that allows to detect security policy violations and network intrusions in a heterogeneous, networked environment. We have designed a pattern language in order to express intrusions (i.e. offending event patterns) in a declarative manner. This allows to specify what to detect instead of how to detect, A fully distributed approach to find the given patterns is presented as well, We use mobile agents to correlate event data instead of moving the whole information to a central location, This increases the fault tolerance and scalability of our system.

TI  - Orthodoxy and advocacy in criminology
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - In his belated riposte to my critique of the 'critical consensus' (P.A.J. Waddington, 1991), David Waddington (1998) seek; to defend the conceptual adequacy and methodological integrity of that position, and especially his own 'flashpoints' model (D. Waddington et al., 1987, 1989). In this reply, I demonstrate that not only is his defence unconvincing, but my original critique can be further developed. Conceptually, the notion of 'precipitating incidents' is inevitably applied ex post facto, but also compresses complex patterns of interaction into a single, arbitrary incident and, furthermore, relies upon an impoverished notion of the crowd. Methodologically, lack of equivocation and hesitancy are no substitute for careful and systematic recording of what occurs. The 'critical consensus' remains not only value-ladened, but advocacy. Moreover, it illustrates a characteristic feature of social movements/moral entrepreneurs: the attempt to 'frame' events so as to cast claimants as 'victims'. indeed, there seem to be good grounds for regarding the 'critical consensus' as simply part of a wider social movement that received political impetus from the riots of the early 1980s.

TI  - The framing of political advocacy and service responses in the crime victim rights movement
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WELFARE
AB  - This paper analyses two major aspects of the mobilizing frames found among local organizations in the crime victim rights movement. A national survey of 301 organizations demonstrated that organizations shape their service/action responses in terms of three conceptualizations of the ''victim problem.'' These conceptualizations clearly influence the pattern of service programs found in different types of organizations. In addition it is shown that some types of organizations are more oriented to political advocacy than others; yet all types of organizations are more apt to be involved in political action if their staff members are oriented to ''victim rights'' framed as changing the status of victims in the criminal justice system.

TI  - ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS REGARDING SECURITY AND PREMISES LIABILITY
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH
AB  - American common law traditionally did not hold landlords civilly liable for criminal attack against their tenants and other business invitees. There is a trend, however, to find for plaintiffs where inadequate security measures have been taken, particularly if the risk of criminal attack is determined to have been reasonably foreseeable. Some premises liability cases have involved architects and engineering professionals where it has been argued that negligent design and/or site selection contributed to the likelihood crime would occur Principles of environmental criminology can be utilized to determine if there is actual notice that crime is reasonably foreseeable by looking at official and unofficial records. Constructive notice involves consideration of crime magnets, crime displacement, criminal mobility, population and vehicle traffic patterns, pedestrian traffic, and Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design.
