AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

AB  - Based on a rational choice approach, this study compares the decision making involved in the crime commission process of rapists (n = 30), child molesters (n = 17), and victim-crossover sex offenders (n = 22). Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Motiveless homicides are usually defined as homicides in which a victim is killed by an offender and a motive was not determined by the police investigation. Motiveless does not mean that the police do not know the motive for the homicide, but rather that no other motive could accurately and objectively explain the reason for why the homicide occurred. However, this is especially problematic for the police because failing to establish a homicide motive is considered an investigative shortcoming. Due to the limited research conducted to date on motiveless homicides and the significant challenges they pose to investigators, the current study examines the geographic mobility patterns involved in these homicides. Using a sample of 194 solved cases of motiveless homicide from France, the criminal mobility triangle approach was used to explore their geographic patterns. Moreover, correlates of the entire criminal event were included for an in-depth understanding of these cases. The findings revealed various mobility patterns involved in motiveless homicides, combined with some specific correlates of the criminal event. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of the investigation of these crimes.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - ObjectivesCrime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day.MethodsWe put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations.ResultsThe results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day.ConclusionOur extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.

AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions.

AB  - Property crimes and mobile banditry: an introductionThis editorial focuses on traditional types of property crime in the Netherlands and Belgium, such as burglary and theft, and property crimes involving mobile organised crime groups (MOCGs) originating from Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and the Balkan countries. Over the past four decades, a relatively limited number of studies addressed specific types of traditional property crime, but in both countries a body of literature focusing on target selection by residential burglars has been established. Overall, a wide range of perpetrators can be identified, for example individual opportunists; itinerant groups which mostly originate from urban networks who commit property crimes in their areas of residence, but also in other parts of the country and abroad; and foreign mobile organised crime groups. Similar to observations in other countries, traditional property crime also dropped substantially in the Low Countries, although since 2022 figures regarding for instance car theft, theft of vehicle parts, e-bikes, and pickpocketing have started to increase. A solid explanation for both the crime drop and the recent rise in crime levels cannot be provided, although the latter is associated with increased activity of MOCGs, which may now be responsible for a quarter to one-third of traditional property crime. Highly professional MOCGs from Eastern Europe, and Lithuania in particular, focus on burglary, theft of expensive cars and e-bikes, agricultural produce and equipment, and theft of car parts, such as navigation, steering, and airbags. MOCGs originating from South-Eastern Europe and the Balkan countries are often composed of men, women and children and focus for instance on shoplifting, pickpocketing, residential burglary, metal theft and (forced) begging. In both cases, some members, particularly minors but also adults, can be considered victims of criminal exploitation.

AB  - Despite the intense and prolonged public attention received when a child is abducted and killed, there are major gaps in the academic literature. One of the gaps pertains to the distances traveled by the offender between key crime locations. The overall aim of this study was to provide information concerning typical travel distances of offenders. This project utilized an archival data set compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The database constructed for this project consisted of 72 victims who were abducted and murdered by 68 offenders. The date range for these offenses was 1970–2006. The research questions were addressed with t-tests for independent samples and multiple linear regressions. Three primary dependent variables under investigation in this study were (a) the distance between the offender's residence and the abduction site, (b) the distance between the abduction site and the disposal of the victim's remains, (c) the distance between the location of the body disposal site and the offender's residence. Additionally, a multitude of bivariate analyses were examined. The variables examined in various combinations using bivariate analyses were offender characteristics, victim characteristics, distance variables, and crime event variables.  Although findings were primarily insignificant, they contribute to the general literature regarding child abduction homicide offenses. While a number of studies have related child abduction/homicide to specific contexts, little research has been done relating child abduction to theoretical frameworks. This study explored routine activities theory, rational choice theory, and crime pattern theory as they relate to the geographical behavior of child abductors/murderers.

AB  - According to a rational choice theory of crime location choice, offenders commit crimes at locations where the mix of expected rewards and costs is optimal. The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crime -- illicit drug dealing in an open air drug market -- and tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for criminological theory and research methods. [web URL: http://ccj.sagepub.com/content/31/4/376.abstract]

AB  - Purpose - Most researchers have found that property crimes have a local focus: offenders tend to operate in the vicinity of their residence. This has led the police to organise themselves to concentrate their resources in highly populated, urban areas. Over the last decade mobile property offenders have been found in various Western European countries that differ from this norm. These groups of mainly Eastern European multiple offenders engaging in property crime tend to travel further than other offenders. As such, their operations differ from most criminals, challenging the way the police are organised and undermining criminological theories on journey to crime. The aim of this paper is to look at the specificity of mobility patterns of these groups, to examine the precise interpretation of their mobility and to consider the implications. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the Belgian police database containing all serious property crimes in Belgium for the period 2002-2006. Some basic offender characteristics have been identified and for these offenders journey-to-crime patterns have been established. Findings - Eastern European multiple offending groups tend to commit their crimes in rural areas. Although they start their journey in regions considered "crime importing", they carry out their crimes in "crime exporting" areas. As such, they are atypical, challenging traditional theories on journey-to-crime and the way in which police forces are organised. Research limitations/implications - Observing a special group is one thing, but explaining these differences is another. Further research is needed, in particular with regard to the motivational aspects for these offenders. Originality/value - Whereas most researchers have found crime (including property crime) to be mainly local, the present research focuses on more mobile offenders. The challenges that these groups create for law enforcement authorities make it important for them and their patterns of activity to be understood.

AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the US District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

AB  - Coal miners’ struggles with black lung disease can be traced to the 1800s. Back then, coal miners fought to make the industry accept that coal mine dust was the culprit behind black lung disease, but they failed. By 1900, some clinicians started recognizing that coal miners suffered from anthracosis or asthma. The miners realized that they could accomplish more if they worked as a team and formed the United Mine Workers of America. They attempted to get compensation for disabled coal miners but failed repeatedly. Their hard work gradually brought about change with the passage of the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act which allowed the government to inspect coal mines, establish safety coal-dust level policies, and compensate sick coal miners. Gaining black lung disease benefits was not as easy as expected. Despite several thousand coal miners applying for black lung disease benefits, only a few thousand received them since the coal companies would mostly appeal benefit award claims for decades until the coal miner and/or his wife gave up or died. After the act was passed, there was a decrease in black lung disease cases until 2000, when the number started to rise again, especially among young coal miners.Many scholars have been looking for an explanation for the sudden increase in black lung disease cases since 2000. Some theorize that the increase was caused by coal mining companies cutting corners and not maintaining safe coal dust levels; the true extent of the problem was unknown because all coal miners do not test themselves for black lung disease. This research uses rational choice theory to analyze the decisions of key players, such as the federal government (Congress and the President), coal miners, black lung disease medical experts, coal mine operators/owners, and appellate courts, to identify patterns in the way their decisions impacted the US Department of Labor’s ability to implement the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act (Policy) and the amendments added years later and also determine whether the federal government has properly implemented coal mining safety and health policies in the coal mining industry. The researcher would consider coal mine explosion investigations, criminal and/or civil cases related to coal mine explosions, violations to Environmental Protection Agency policies, and attempts by coal miners, and watchdog and coal mining organizations to obtain monetary damages and/or a judicial order to stop the federal government from issuing a coal mining permit or stop implementing the policies for coal mining federal agencies such as the MSHA. Coal mine explosion investigations and criminal/civil cases began in 2000 and has continued since then. The literature review suggests that the black lung cases among coal miners first noticeably rose in the mid 1990s. This research will answer the following questions:1.	How are the major findings of the mine explosions reports, criminal cases, and civil cases related to the administration of justice?2.	How are the major findings from the mine explosions reports, criminal cases, and civil cases related to the administration of black lung disease benefits?3.	How do the actions of key players (state and federal legislators, coal mining operators/owners, coal miners, and the federal government and federal agencies) possible hinder the US Department of Labor’s ability to implement the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act (Policy) and its later amendments? How can it be determined whether the federal government has properly implemented coal mining safety and health policies in the coal mining industry?

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbers targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available." [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. In addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements - the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention - to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases—100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Quantitative Approaches to the Study of TerrorismRational choice perspectives maintain that seemingly irrational behavior on the part of terrorist organizations may nevertheless reflect strategic planning. In this paper we examine spatial and temporal patterns of terrorist attacks by the Spanish group ETA between 1970 and 2007. Our analysis is guided by a public announcement by ETA in 1978 that the group would shift from emphasizing attacks in the Basque territory to instead launch attacks more widely in the hopes of exhausting the Spanish government and forcing it to abandon the Basque territory. This announcement suggests that prior to the end of 1978 ETA attacks were based mostly on controlling territory in the Basque region that they hoped to rule; and after 1978 the organization decided to instead undertake a prolonged war of attrition. Accordingly, we argue that before the end of 1978 ETA was mostly perpetrating control attacks (attacking only within the Basque territories) and that the diffusion of attacks between provinces was mostly contagious (spreading contiguously). After the 1978 proclamation, we argue that the attack strategy shifted toward attrition (attacking in areas outside of the Basque territories) and that the attacks were more likely to diffuse hierarchically (spreading to more distant locations). As predicted, we find that after ETA moved toward a more attrition based attack strategy, subsequent attacks were significantly more likely to occur outside the Basque region and to target non-adjacent regions (consistent with hierarchical diffusion). We also find that hierarchical diffusion was more common when a longer time elapsed between attacks (a likely consequence of the fact that more distant attacks require more resources and planning) and that attacks against Madrid were unlikely to be followed immediately by more attacks on Madrid or surrounding provinces. After ETA announced a shift in policy, they maintained a highly dispersed attack strategy even during their period of decline. Using information about where and when prior attacks occurred could provide useful information for policy makers countering groups like ETA.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Examining the role of individual differences in perceptions of risk and rewards to offending has become an important line of inquire (Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, & Madensen, 2006); however, psychopathy has yet to be considered. We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending.

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that "taste" preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.

AB  - Relying on rational choice theory, we compare burglars' varying levels of offense planning to understand differences among types of burglars. Surveys were collected from a sample of incarcerated male and female burglars in three states. Participants answered questions detailing aspects of a burglary including motivations, target selection, deterrents, and techniques. Comparisons were made between 119 deliberate (32%) and 257 impulsive (68%) burglars. Deliberate burglars focused on obtaining cash, whereas impulsive burglars were more motivated by drug habits. Impulsive burglars were more easily dissuaded from a target when multiple obstacles are present. Burglars consider how many obstacles they may have to overcome, providing support for rational choice-based, situational crime prevention efforts. Differences in burglar motivation emerged and are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the trends in and spatial distribution of recorded offending by Australian outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) affiliates at the onset of a territorial conflict between two clubs in the state of New South Wales. Results show an increase in recorded offending by OMCG affiliates involved in the conflict and based in the disputed territory. Comparable increases in recorded offending by these clubs were not detected in the areas surrounding this territory or in the rest of New South Wales, and there was little mobility into the conflict region by those outside of it. There was a smaller, short-lived increase in recorded crime by affiliates of other gangs in the conflict region but not elsewhere. In short, changes in offending patterns were largely limited to the clubs involved in the conflict and localised to the territory in dispute. This research can help guide focused law enforcement responses during periods of gang conflict.

AB  - The current study investigates body disposal patterns in sexual homicide and examines whether offender’s behavior differ between solved and unsolved cases. To address these two research questions in line with rational choice perspective, a series of logistic regression analyses was conducted on a sample of 250 solved, and 100 unsolved sexual homicide cases in Canada. Within solved cases, results show that if victim is a prostitute, body found concealed, and found lying face down, it is likely the body was moved. For unsolved cases, the role of victim as a prostitute, and body recovered outdoors suggest that the body was moved. Further, results indicate that post-crime phase factors predicted the most whether the victim’s body was moved in solved cases. Whereas within unsolved cases, crime-phase factors contributed the most at predicting whether the body was moved post-homicide. Theoretical and practical implications from this study are discussed.

AB  - ObjectivesThe burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets.MethodsUsing police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling.ResultsImportance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations.ConclusionsImportance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making.

AB  - The article examines space-time patterns of maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa. Using rational choice theory and optimal foraging theory as the theoretic frame, 6 years of recorded pirate attack data were used to test whether spatial and temporal attack patterns were independent. The results indicate evidence for a communicability of risk; that is, pirate activity clusters in space and time. Incorporating this finding means that forecasting of high-risk areas could be made more effective. The theoretical implication is that pirates' target selection appears to be consistent with other crime types, such as burglary, car crime and shootings. The results have implications for informing maritime piracy prevention and suppression efforts.

AB  - Crime scene analysts are the core of criminal investigations; decisions made at the scene greatly affect the speed of analysis and quality of conclusions that directly impact the successful resolution of a case. If an examiner does not recognize the pertinence of an item on scene, it cannot be used to support his or her theory regarding the crime. Conversely, unselective evidence collection will include irrelevant material, thus increasing a forensic laboratory's backlog and sending the investigation into an unproductive and costly direction. Therefore, it is critical that analysts recognize and properly evaluate forensic evidence that can support or disprove hypotheses and accurately reconstruct events. With this in mind, the aim of the study was to determine if quantitative eye tracking data and qualitative observations could be used to distinguish investigator expertise. In order to assess this, 32 participants were recruited and categorized as experts or trained novices based on their educational and practical backgrounds. Each volunteer then processed a mock crime scene while wearing a mobile eye tracker, wherein visual fixations, duration, search patterns and qualitative reconstruction accuracy were evaluated. Quantitative eye tracking data were compared using pursuit percentage on areas of interest (AOIs), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Needleman-Wunsch (N-W) algorithm. Results indicate significant group differences (Mann-Whitney U test,  α = 0:05) for two out of 14 AOIs selected for analysis in this study. In addition, significant group differences were also detected for both search duration on specific AOIs (EMD), as well as search sequence (N-W), wherein experts exhibited more dissimilar search durations, but more similar search sequences than their novice counterparts (with possible implications regarding hypothesis-based scene reconstruction). Finally, hierarchical and  k-means clustering based on multivariate AOIs suggest that latent variables may be present, which is the topic of future research. In addition to the quantitative visual comparisons, each participant's reconstruction skill was assessed using a 22-point binary system. Significant group difference (Mann-Whitney U test,  α = 0:05) was detected as a function of total reconstruction accuracy. However, the total number of cases processed does not correlate linearly (or well) with total reconstruction score. Equally of interest was the fact that canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) provided good group separability as a function of participant education (which was found to be more important for this cohort than professional development). Overall, results from this study found significant and interesting group differences, but likewise revealed the complexity associated with using gaze behavior as a means of assessing cognitive processes.

AB  - ObjectivesTo empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars’ choice of residence to burglarize.MethodsWe combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars’ target choice in a conditional logit model.ResultsBurglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection.ConclusionsBoth area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars’ target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.

AB  - Recently, increased attention has been given to the social and environmental context in which crimes occur (Wells & Weisheit 2004). This new interest in the human ecology of crime is largely demographic, both in terms of subject matter and increasingly in terms of the analytic methods used. Building on existing literature on the social ecology of crime, this study introduces a new approach to studying sub-county geographies of reported crime using existing census place and county definitions coupled with spatial demographic methods. Spatially decomposing counties into Census places and what Esselstyn (1953) earlier called "open country," or non-places, allows for the development of a unique but phenomenological meaningful sub-county geography that substantively holds meaning in conceptualizing rural and urban localities in the demographic analysis of crime. This decomposition allows for the examination of core-periphery relationships at the sub-county level, which are hypothesized to act similarly to those at the national level (Agnew 1993; Lightfoot and Martinez 1995). Using 1990 to 2000 Agency-level UCR data within this approach, I propose to use spatial statistics to describe and explain patterns of crime across differing localities. Potential processes of spatial mobility in regards to the spread of criminal activity from places to non-place localities are also examined.  In order to adequately understand these spatial patterns of crime while testing the usability of the new place-level geography, several of the generally accepted theories of crime and a number of explanatory factors and covariates are tested. Furthermore, using this sub-county geography, significant patterns of spatial diffusion and contagion are through the implementation and modification of the spatio-temporal model, which provides the current point of departure and put forth by Cohen and Tita (1999). The results are promising and suggest a meaningful contribution to the ecological analysis of crime and the larger sub-discipline of spatial demography.

AB  - Objectives:This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week.Method:The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.Results:The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open.Conclusions:The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

AB  - Informal social control at micro-level places such as addresses, collections of addresses, and streetblocks is a critical factor in understanding crime patterns. Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing "eyes on the street" and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events. The article explains each theory, discusses the spatial scale at which the dynamics operate, highlights gaps in the current body of knowledge, and proposes a two-pronged research path forward.

AB  - In recent years, criminologists have increasingly focused on understanding stability and change in crime over the life-course. Transitions such as marriage, work, and military service are considered to be potential turning points in the life-course that redirect one’s criminal career. Relatively neglected in life-course scholarship is a consideration of whether residential mobility is also a turning point that facilitates desistance from crime and substance use. The few studies that have examined this topic suggest that individuals who make long-distance moves are less likely to engage in crime compared to those who stay or those who make short-distance moves within their community (Kirk, 2009; 2012; Laub and Sampson, 2003; Osborn, 1980; Sharkey and Sampson, 2010; Shaw, 1966). Yet, several important gaps in the literature exist. The purpose of this dissertation is to advance life-course scholarship by addressing two important gaps in the existing body of research on residential mobility and desistance. First, this dissertation is the first study to examine the relationship between residential mobility (defined as a between-county move) and desistance from crime and substance use during the transition to adulthood. This gap is noteworthy given that residential mobility is an age-graded life event that is central to the transition to adulthood. In the U.S., rates of residential mobility are highest in the young adult years compared to any other developmental period, and scholars suggest that such moves constitute key role transitions and have important implications for locational attainment. Second, this dissertation is also one of the first studies to examine whether the relationship between residential mobility and desistance from crime depends on the context of the move. Although the average effect of moving may be protective, the effect likely depends on a number of factors. Two factors may be especially salient to residential moves during the transition to adulthood: (1) whether the move occurs in the presence of other adult social roles and (2) whether the move results in improvements in community context. There are reasons to expect residential mobility to have stronger or weaker effects depending on these features. This dissertation uses public and restricted geocode data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). These data contain a wealth of information about the transition to young adulthood, including respondents’ residential mobility, crime and substance use, adult social roles, and community context. In addition, restricted geocode data allows me to construct residential mobility patterns of respondents from 1997–2013 and determine the county-level characteristics of every residential location respondents reported living at during the survey. The primary contribution of this dissertation consists of three empirical chapters. The first empirical chapter examines the effect of residential mobility on desistance from crime and substance use during the transition to adulthood. The second empirical chapter examines whether the effect of residential mobility on crime depends on whether the move is accompanied by positive or negative adult social role transitions. The last empirical chapter examines whether moving into, out of, or remaining in counties marked by concentrated disadvantage and racial/ethnic segregation influences desistance from crime. In all three chapters, random effects regression is used to model within-individual change in residential mobility on change in offending, controlling for important time-stable and time-varying confounders. Results revealed that respondents experience immediate reductions in offending after moving, but with delinquency and substance use, the reductions were smaller (and possibly shorter lived); whereas, the reductions for arrest were larger and more sustained. Results also revealed that the effects of moving were relatively robust across key groups (i.e., gender, race, age, and criminal propensity). Finally, results revealed that the effects of residential mobility often depend on whether they are accompanied by adult social roles as well as the community context.

AB  - Since the last decade of the twentieth century, several authors have claimed that the contemporary and 'new' developments in (private) policing and crime control form part of the process of neo-liberal policies and rational choice approaches to crime. However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned.

AB  - ObjectivesThis study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders.MethodsAnalyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age.ResultsFindings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders.ConclusionsThis research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.

AB  - Research into offender mobility has shown that, generally speaking, most offenders commit crimes in the vicinity of their homes. Several approaches can be taken to explain such behavior, including rational choice of perspective which states that offenders weigh their costs and benefits, and offender's awareness space which refers to all spaces of which an offender has knowledge. Here, Van Daele and Vander Beken address how the crime patterns of mobile offenders are shaped by their awareness space.

AB  - ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

AB  - Objective: We investigate the role that neighborhood socioeconomic contexts and defendant mobility patterns play in prosecutorial charge reductions. Methods: Using data from a large sample of criminal defendants prosecuted during 2010 to 2011 in New York County (N = 68,113), we analyze differences in charge reductions for defendants who reside and offend in low- and high-income areas, and for those who traverse socioeconomically divergent neighborhoods when committing crime. Results: Net of individual defendant characteristics, like gender and race, we find that defendants from low-income neighborhoods who offend in high-income locales are significantly less likely to benefit from discretionary charge reductions. Conclusions: Defendant mobility patterns play a key role in defining the social context of criminal punishment. This suggests it is essential to consider both where a defendant resides and where their crime is committed when assessing the role of ecological stereotypes and place-based attributions in criminal court actor decision-making.

AB  - People ebb and flow across the city. The spatial and temporal patterning of crime is, in part, reflective of this mobility, of the scale of the population present in any given setting at a particular time. It is also a function of capacity of this population to perform an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in any specific crime type, itself shaped by the time-variant activities undertaken in, and the qualities of, particular settings. To this end, this paper explores the intra-daily influence of activities and settings upon the weekday spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public spaces. This task is achieved through integrating a transient population dataset with travel survey, point-of-interest and recorded crime data in a study of Great Manchester (UK). The research deploys a negative binomial regression model controlling for spatial lag effects. It finds strong and independent, but time-variant, associations between leisure activities, leisure settings and the spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public space. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings.

AB  - PurposeThis paper analyzes trading and tipping activities in insider trading litigation decided by federal courts from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014.Design/methodology/approachLegal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes.FindingsResults of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements.Originality/valueThis paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense.

AB  - Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

AB  - Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example. Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour -- central place foraging, Brownian walks and Levy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Levy walks, respectively. Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Levy walks. The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Levy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed.

AB  - Presently, 1 of every 200 American adults is confined in a state or federal prison. The vast majority of these prisoners are eventually released, and each year approximately 700,000 convicted offenders leave prisons and return to communities across the country. Where they go after prison is an important part of the community reentry and reintegration process. Ex-inmates who move frequently after prison or who live in poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to recidivate and return to prison. While it is generally recognized that housing and residential characteristics are important during reentry, little is known about the actual residential mobility patterns of individuals with a history of incarceration. The current study uses nationally representative longitudinal data to examine how incarceration (and especially life after release) impacts individual residential mobility behavior. I draw on core perspectives of stratification and attainment to place incarceration alongside other life events known to be correlated with residential mobility. I find that, like many life events, incarceration creates short-term residential mobility. However, in contrast to events like marriage and homeownership, which foster residential stability, incarceration contributes to long-term patterns of residential instability. The difference in observed mobility between survey respondents with and without a history of incarceration becomes larger across time. With this information in mind, I then examine if ex-inmate mobility patterns are associated with upward or downward social mobility (or locational attainment). Housing careers of non-inmates generally move in an upward direction, as individuals and households use residential mobility to match their residences to evolving housing needs. I argue that incarceration might block or even reverse this process, ultimately trapping ex-inmates in poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods. I find that incarceration is associated with downward mobility into poor neighborhoods, but is unrelated to upward mobility out of them. I close by noting the implications and contributions of my findings, some important study limitations, and highlighting areas for future research.

AB  - While the use of mobile phones and text messaging has made it easier for hostage negotiators to communicate with other law enforcement personnel in crisis situations, little research has examined how text messaging could be used to communicate with the perpetrator.  The purpose of this preliminary, qualitative study was to explore the similarities and differences in communication patterns of two hostage negotiations, one that took place verbally and one that occurred through text message. Both transcripts were analyzed using the Crisis Communication Rating Scale (CCRS), a behavioral coding system developed by McClain (2004). The study provided initial insight into several important similarities and differences between the modes of communication. First, the hostage negotiator relied heavily on the use of personal and situational disclosures to resolve the situation, regardless of the mode of communication. Additionally, both the hostage negotiator and barricaded suspect used reflective statements more frequently when they were able to communicate verbally. Lastly, when communicating through text message, the hostage negotiator used persuasive statements more frequently, while the barricaded suspect used expressive statements of anger more frequently. Possible implications for training and practice are discussed.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives -- crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender—Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives:This article examines to what extent repeat offenders’ crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times.Methods:Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.Results:Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime.Conclusions:Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.

AB  - Law-breaking behaviors, especially those surrounding the use of illicit drugs and substances, has been an ever-increasing issue within our society, especially with the perceived “addiction as disease” or “disorder” models (see Volkow, 2000, 2016; Goldstein, 2002; Brewer, 2008; Hall, 2015). There is plenty of evidence to demonstrate that drugs alter one’s state of mind, and often leads to “poor decision making.” However, the real question proposed in the debates here is, are levels of alteration sufficient to conclude rational or irrational calculations absent or devoid…does an altered state invalidate all possibilities of one’s free-agency in the function of the “choice” equation. The current arguments of addiction are similar in nature to those which pose “society,” or external mechanisms are to blame for the choices of individuals, in their restrictive capacity.Contemporary approaches have largely been ineffective in their methods, as often they remove the capacity of free-agency, mistaking flawed  logic for being equivalent to no logic. The purpose of this work is to show the need to include rational choice as party to any developing model to the subjects of sociology. Further, to investigate  pre- and post-understanding before and after substance use. Peripheral intent, to explore the ideas of the “appearance of rationale,” and adaptational views and concepts, looking towards the future of RCT-based models.This study explores three areas of inquiry concerning substance use understanding, in an attempt to identify patterns of conflicting personal philosophies or identify potential evidence of decisions based on what “seems rational” among the subjective experiences. The primary gaps in the literature, appear to be due to self-created “blind-spots;” by blaming inanimate things as “drugs” or the environment, failing to account in full for how the individual actor may be perceiving, reacting, or interacting within and without a given social atmosphere. There is a large failure to see the individual as a rational being even amidst “bad choices.” Poor decisions do not negate that rationalizing may have occurred, perhaps rather only flawed, underdeveloped or perhaps impaired  rationale. Even the schizophrenic suffering from a state of delusion is acknowledged as making perceived logical and reasoned decisions, accordingly to environmental stimuli, along with the information they believe and perceive themselves to be receiving (see Csukly et al., 2011). To them, there is an ordered logic, which remains true, present and occurring regardless of how illogical these behavioral choices seem to outsiders.There is emerging literature which contradicts many of the contemporary ideological approaches to law-breaking behaviors, chiefly among views on substance use, demonstrating that there is a clear conflict and irreconcilable understanding of the issues under current theoretical approaches (see Hart, 2014; Lewis, 2015; Fenton & Wiers, 2017 & Hather, 2017). Many are pushing against those which have adopted excusatory policies, in labeling addiction as “disease.” Theory’s which lead to the labeling of “drug use” and “addiction” as being so simplex or viewed merely as a disease-ridden ailment for the sufferer, fail to account for alternative behavior and free-will exercise. Likewise blaming the environment alone, in exclaiming “they had no choice,” both outlooks significantly diminishes both the capacity and potential of what the human experience is and could be. Hard science-based theory’s, as those built on laboratory experiments (see Yanagit et al., 1965; Alexander & Hadaway, 1981; Peele, 1985), have mixed and often conflicting results, and are insufficient to be translative in terms of conceptualization regarding human thinking and behavior.

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single‐family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

AB  - The importance of neighborhoods and places in understanding crime has been widely noted in criminology. Using various units of analysis (e.g., states, counties, cities, neighborhoods, places), studies have found that crime tends to be spatially concentrated. Based on social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, relationships between the level of crime and various neighborhood characteristics have been noted in the literature. Reviews of the existing literature, however, have identified several limitations of neighborhood level studies of crime. First, many neighborhood level studies have utilized cross-sectional samples and failed to analyze temporal dynamics between neighborhood changes and crime. Second, until recently, criminological studies paid little attention to two spatial processes, spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity, in developing spatial regression models. Third, most studies examined only places and neighborhoods where crimes were committed and failed to account for where offenders were coming from. By integrating newly developed statistical methods from interdisciplinary fields with social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, this dissertation pursued a series of research questions that examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of crime at the neighborhood level. First, a longitudinal analysis of crime between 1960 and 2005 in Seattle, WA, indicated that neighborhood crime rate trajectories were characterized by quadratic functions, although there was considerable variability in both the initial level of crime and rate of change over time. The results indicated that neighborhood characteristics based on social disorganization theory and routine activities theory were important in explaining the variability in crime rate trajectories. In particular, social disorganization predicted changes in crime rates decades later, while the level of crime also changed depending on time specific opportunities for crime. For example, racial heterogeneity and residential mobility predicted the initial level of crime in 1960, while the linear rate of change was predicted by socio-economic disadvantage. Furthermore, an increase in the percentage of employed women was related with high levels of burglary and auto theft, while an increase in the percentage of public transportation users increased robbery at each time point.Second, an analysis of spatial effects indicated the importance of considering both spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity when examining the association between neighborhood characteristics and crime. In particular, although global regression models produce a single measure of association between an independent variable and a dependent variable that applies to a whole study area, the results indicated there was considerable variability in the local patterns of association between neighborhood characteristics and the level of crime. For example, the results indicated that the effects of racial heterogeneity on the level of crime varied in strength and direction across space. That is, although social disorganization theory predicts that racial heterogeneity hinders the realization of common goals among residents and increases crime, the results indicated racial heterogeneity may actually reduce crime in some neighborhoods. Variability in local patterns of association are important in further understanding social processes linking the structural characteristics of neighborhoods to the level of crime and developing place-focused crime prevention strategies.Third, an analysis of burglars’ target selection indicated that neighborhood characteristics were highly predictive of which neighborhoods burglars target. In particular, it was found that the likelihood of burglars selecting a neighborhood for the commission of their crimes increased as criminal opportunities for crime increased (e.g., weakened household guardianship due to high employment). Furthermore, the analysis also indicated that burglars’ target selection varied by burglars’ characteristics, such as age, race, and the presence of co-offenders. For example, burglars’ target selection was strongly affected by their race and the racial composition of the target neighborhood. Furthermore, younger offenders’ target selection was strongly influenced by distance from their residence to a target neighborhood, while, in addition to distance, various neighborhood characteristics also affected older offenders’ target selection.Overall, the three studies conducted in this dissertation found support for both social disorganization theory and routine activities theory in explaining crime at the neighborhood level. By empirically studying the spatial and temporal aspects of crime at the neighborhood level, this dissertation adds to existing research on the role that neighborhood characteristics play in producing crime-conducive environments.

AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Burglary represents not only a violation of privacy and theft of private property; it also causes considerable fear, and this is true across the world. Unfortunately, most burglary research is conducted with data for Western countries, and there is especially little comparative research of U.S. and Asian countries, which have different social and cultural contexts. This study draws on the rational choice perspective which argues offenders who are likely to engage in rational decision making processes as they estimate the costs and benefits of committing a given crime. Two central questions guide this study: What considerations Thai offenders have when deciding whether or not to commit crime, and how they choose specific targets. This study addresses these questions using data from interviews with incarcerated residential burglars in Thailand. Data were collected primarily though semi-structured interviews with 45 Thai inmates who had been incarcerated in federal and local correctional institutions around Bangkok and vicinity, and had been convicted of residential burglary at some point in their criminal careers.Interviewees were asked about their own experiences in committing burglaries, including those in which they wanted to commit a burglary but chose not to do so as originally planned. Interviewees were asked to complete a map task to clarify the locations of their targets on a map of Bangkok City. A central focus of the study was the offenders' target selection methodology, and in the study interviewees were explicitly queried as to how they went about identified suitable residential targets for burglary. Special attention was given to the extent to which offenders utilized rational processes to select potential burglary targets, and what environmental conditions and features they used as discriminative cues in the process.Although the findings of this study should be interpreted carefully due to the relatively small sample size of the interviewees, analysis of the study data indicates that both the risks and the rewards of residential burglary influence burglars' target selection. However, when assessing potential residential burglary targets, burglars are significantly more influenced by environmental cues related to risk than by cues related to reward. Most burglars considered some burglary prevention measures such as burglary alarms, neighborhood watch, dogs, and sign of repeat victimization.Important key findings relate to cultural differences in burglars’ target selection and the decision making during the burglary process. For example, most burglars believed in fate and luck when they decided to commit burglary. Gender and age are both important factors causing differences in residential burglars’ decision making about target selection and crime commission. Based on the findings of this study, guidelines that could be useful in the development of various residential burglary prevention initiatives and measures, such as increasing more police patrol, developing job training programs inside prison, and establishing neighborhood watch programs, are put forward for consideration.

AB  - Mass transit is often thought to be dangerous, eliciting concerns for personal security when waiting for and traveling on mass transit. One of the first steps in preventing crime in mass transit environments is to obtain accurate figures of crime. There are two mechanisms linking mass transit to crime: extension of offenders’ journey-to-crime and development of crime attractors and generators. The first mechanism has been tested by comparing crime patterns when a new light rail system was expanded into new areas; these studies reported that new transit systems do not change crime patterns. Testing the second mechanism, whether mass transit enhances crime opportunities in the neighborhoods by attracting targets and offenders alike, however, faces more challenges; testing the impact of small places on larger areas such as transit stations on crime is fraught with difficulties due to the interactions with their surrounding environments. These difficulties are even more relevant for bus stops located without clear demarcation or controlled access. Using frameworks of routine activity, crime pattern, and rational choice theories, the present study set out to investigate the relationships between bus stops and crime using Newark, New Jersey as the study area. To delineate the impact of bus stops on their surroundings from other possible covariates, the existence of commercial activities in the areas was also examined. The present research study examined five crime types: robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, theft from motor vehicle, and burglary. To better understand the impacts of spatial aspects of the data, several data analyses methods were utilized. First, the study examined the magnitude and structure of spatial dependence in the data. Second, spatial process models were performed and compared with the OLS regression results to examine the impacts of spatial aspects on the regression results. Third, to address non-normality and spatial dependence of the data, the count response model was run by adding spatial lag as one of the predictors. The data analysis results showed that both bus stops and commercial establishments were associated with increased crime in the neighborhoods. Among the business types, some of them displayed more robust relationships than others. For instance, the category of food store was almost always significant to increased crime whereas banks were not statistically significant across crime types and regression methods. Considering the fact that fear of crime plays a strong role as actual risk of crime in making travel decisions, it is suggested that the physical and social incivilities should be analyzed by performing an environmental survey using case-control design. In addition, future research should incorporate both short-term and long-term temporal analysis.

AB  - A central question in criminology is the degree to which adult transitions are sources of stability or change throughout the life course. Transitions in the form of marriage and employment are said to represent turning points for those most prone for a life course of persistent offending, as such experiences 'knife off' a criminal past. Few studies, however, have considered college completion as an adult transition capable of redirecting one's criminal trajectory. Moreover, research largely assumes that any attainment represents a positive turning point, but whether transitions like educational attainment really are positive depends on how these resources compare to prior generations, such as those of one's parents.The study of social mobility broadens our understanding of socioeconomic attainments by encompassing continuity and change within the life course, as certain achievements may be indicative of stability while others may represent a change – either positive or negative. For instance, obtaining a high school diploma may symbolize a positive turning point for those who grew up in poverty, while similar achievements for those from a higher social class may reflect a loss in social status if it is not followed by further educational attainment. Drawing on theories of social mobility, strain, and relative deprivation, I analyze the relationship between educational mobility and crime using data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). First, I examine the relationship between educational mobility (i.e., one's own achieved education in relation to parents' attainment) and various types of crime (i.e., instrumental crime, violent crime, and illegal drug use). Next, I investigate how gender and race/ethnicity moderate the association between educational mobility and crime. Finally, I assess the concern of selection into educational mobility pathways via propensity score analyses, with the purpose of accounting for the confounding bias that may explain the alleged educational mobility and crime association. Results show that upward and downward intergenerational mobility are associated with decreases and increases in instrumental crime, violent crime, and illegal drug use, respectively. Effects are slightly attenuated in size after controlling for occupational and familial transitions in adulthood, as well as financial stressors and social psychological measures. Moreover, downward educational mobility is associated with greater increases in crime for females compared to males, and upward mobility results in greater reductions in crime for blacks and native-born Hispanics. Finally, results show that overall patterns of intergenerational mobility are robust when incorporating a series of propensity score techniques that account for confounding bias. In total, this dissertation contributes to the long speculated socioeconomic status and crime connection by integrating social mobility and education into criminological research as meaningful sources of change in the life course.

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

AB  - While violence across the United States has declined dramatically over the past two decades, gang-related crimes remain at unacceptably high rates, especially within the city of Los Angeles, America's gang capital. Gang-related crimes generally involve groups of individuals and have a strong territorial component, lending themselves to geographically targeted interventions. A strategy that has charmed law enforcement agencies with its ability to take advantage of both the social and spatial features of a gang is the civil gang injunction (CGI). Essentially, a CGI is a tailored restraining order against a gang, prohibiting its members from engaging in specific nuisance behaviors within a demarcated geographical region, termed a "safety-zone." Evaluations suggest that CGIs are effective at reducing serious crime and residents' fears; yet, CGIs remain a time-consuming and costly strategy with an unstudied mechanism for why they work. Do CGIs influence how gang members associate and where they hangout? And, more importantly, how do CGIs contribute to changes in gang violence?  Using the framework of routine activities theory, this dissertation focuses on the relationship between CGIs, gang members' patterns of association and lethal violence. To address these questions I utilize two unique datasets: homicide case files and field identification (FI) cards gathered from the Hollenbeck Community Policing Area of the Los Angeles Police Department. My first chapter utilizes social network and spatial analyses to investigate the patterns of association among enjoined gang members at the individual- and group-level. I examine both the characteristics of enjoined gangs' social networks, ascertaining their influence in disrupting social ties, as well as examining the geographic characteristics of FIs to discern if enjoined gangs have changed the spatial patterns of their associations. My second chapter looks at both the homicide trends over the last decade and the disparities between non-gang and gang homicides, both enjoined and non-enjoined, to consider how CGIs influence the characteristics of violence. Lastly, in my third chapter I construct a turf-based spatial typology of gang homicide to investigate the impact that CGIs have on the mobility patterns of participants involved in gang-related homicides. If CGIs influence gangs' spatial patterns of association by discouraging members from congregating in public, then a CGI in theory shifts members' activity and travel patterns, suggesting that gang homicides involving enjoined gang members would experience a different mobility pattern than gang homicides involving only non-enjoined gang members.  Results from this dissertation indicate that CGIs are able to influence the patterns of association of individual gang members, particularly in the short-run. Conversely, at the group-level, enjoined gangs do not always respond as predicted by the rational of a CGI, with a gang's social network either being disrupted, with members' social ties losing connectedness, or a gang's social network converges, with members' social ties increasing in connectedness. It also appears that while CGIs are able to dislodge enjoined members from their gang's hangouts, a CGI actually constrains the overall mobility of enjoined gang members, reducing the likelihood that enjoined gang members are venturing outside of their gang's claimed turf. In relation to influencing the overall patterns of gang violence, the findings suggest that CGIs could be shifting enjoined gang homicides away from the street and into less public spaces, along with involving fewer suspects and victims. Results also indicate that the presence of CGIs in Hollenbeck has impacted the mobility patterns of participants who are involved in a gang homicide. Specifically, an increase in internal gang homicides and a reduction in predatory gang homicides were observed in the data. These findings are consistent with earlier results indicating that the mobility of an enjoined gang member is restricted by the presence of a CGI. Overall, the goal of this dissertation is to provide both scholars and criminal justice professionals with a better understanding of CGIs, and ascertain if they are an appropriate strategy to disrupt a gang's patterns of association and diminish their opportunities to participate in violent acts.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study investigates illegal border crossings by rhino poachers into a fenced reserve in South Africa, comparing journeys to and after crime using a rational choice approach. Using various regression models, our analysis indicates poachers prefer to enter and exit the reserve near high rhino densities, while high road densities outside the reserve increase the odds of an illegal entry. The results also show that half of the incursions occurred at a single location, leading us to describe the special circumstances of this outlier. The study lays a foundation for understanding the location choices poachers make and presents a methodology that can be replicated in other reserves.

AB  - The present article examines the key concepts underlying victimization theories (i.e., exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, guardianship). Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization.

AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions. Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.

AB  - Understanding the targeting decisions of terrorist organizations is a key concept that has been largely overlooked in counter-terrorism research. The success of terrorist organizations in Lebanon motivates the current study to assess how their operational decisions changed as Lebanon transitioned from civil war to state instability. Guided by rational choice theory, I explore the idea that terrorist organizations target entities that are most threatening to their chances of survival using data from the Global Terrorism Database. Specifically, the study uses multinomial logistic regression models to understand terrorist targeting choices in Lebanon from 1975 to 2018. While Lebanon is only a case study, I anticipate that the conclusions drawn here can help us understand similar dynamics in other parts of the world. The primary analysis finds a lack of support in predicted patterns of  terrorist targeting. This study also includes a supplemental analysis providing directions for future research.

AB  - Environmental criminology attempts to explain why criminals choose one crime location over another.  Evidence suggests that criminals prefer to stalk neighborhoods with which they are somewhat familiar, yet which are sufficiently populated to provide them with anonymity.  Criminals also prefer areas of the city where there is little chance that law-abiding citizens will intervene against criminal attack.  Thus, security managers must understand the "business envelope" that surrounds their location.  By answering pertinent questions from the potential criminal's point of view, security managers may assess the likelihood that their facilities would be the targets of attack.  Environmental criminologists tend to assume that property criminals will make somewhat rational choices about crime targets to maximize their profits and minimize their efforts.  An understanding of criminal thought patterns allows for the design of target hardening and other preventive efforts.

AB  - Criminological theories such as routine activities theory, rational choice theory, broken windows and disorder theory, crime pattern and environmental criminology, and social disorganization and collective efficacy theory all suggest the potentiality of a correlation between the presence of abandoned and dilapidated housing and crime. This thesis investigates the geographical locations of homicides that occurred in Kansas City, Missouri in 2016 and dangerous buildings as identified by the municipality. Examination indicates independent clustering of homicides and dangerous buildings and this clustering occurs in the same locational space within the city. Further, the presence of dangerous buildings within census block groups and in surrounding census block groups is correlated with homicides. This finding remains significant when measures of population, poverty, and vacancy are included in the analysis. These outcomes suggest that policies considering the presence of dangerous buildings in conjunction with other violence prevention strategies may be valuable in reducing homicide.

AB  - Considering the extent of the motor vehicle theft (MVT) problem, it is surprising that there is such a dearth of studies on these crimes at the neighborhood level. In 2008, nearly one million vehicles, valued at 6.4 billion dollars, were reported stolen in the United States. Additionally, only half of these stolen vehicles were ever recovered. The purpose of this study is to increase the limited knowledge base on the characteristics of neighborhoods that predict MVT levels. Its focus is on the identification of specific types of land use that increase MVT levels, net the impact of sociodemographics, as posited by the opportunity theories of rational choice, routine activities, and crime pattern theory. The study site is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with its 1816 census block groups serving as the unit of analysis.The percentage of total land area for each block group utilized by various theorized criminogenic land uses is determined by Geographic Information System (GIS). Evaluated land uses include shopping centers, bars, high schools, colleges, parking lots, youth hangouts, and single family homes. A ‘proximity space’ variable is also computed consisting of the percentage of block group area that is located within one street block of the combined criminogenic land uses. Its usefulness is in determining whether the impact of crime-producing land uses spreads into the surrounding neighborhood. Negative binomial regression models test various hypotheses around the general research question “After controlling for socio-structural correlates, is the presence of certain land uses predictive of MVT levels found at the neighborhood level?”Results demonstrate that land use, both independently and through neighborhood demographic structure, promotes or suppresses MVT levels, a finding consistent with opportunity theories. Specifically, the percentage of land use in block groups utilized by shopping centers, bars, and commercial parking lots is related to higher MVT counts, but that utilized by colleges and single family homes predicts lower MVT counts, net the impact of neighborhood sociodemographics. Interaction models demonstrate that SES, racial heterogeneity, single-parent families, and percentage 15-24 year olds moderate the impact of land use on MVT. Findings are relevant to urban planners, crime practitioners, and crime theorists.

AB  - Technological evolutions and burglary target selection: a study on the use of Google Maps and Google Street ViewTechnological progress has a great impact on the lives of many citizens. The increasing amount of available information may however be used by criminals too, for example by burglars in their search for a suitable target. Applying the rational choice perspective and by means of an experiment with students, this paper first investigates whether it is likely or not that tools such as Google Maps and Google Street View are used for burglary. Furthermore, we investigate whether the considered target characteristics differ when such tools are used. The results indicate that we cannot give an affirmative answer to these questions so far.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail -- crime pattern and social disorganization theory -- and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

AB  - Objectives:To determine whether criminogenic “edges,” as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES).Methods:The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected.Results:The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected.Conclusions:The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.

AB  - According to current scholarship on offender decision making, choosing to rob another is based on a variety of individual and situational characteristics. Explanatory models often invoked within environmental criminology include routine activity, rational choice and crime pattern theories. Situational action theory’s suggestion that this decision depends, at least in part, on the interaction between offender criminal propensity and the setting’s moral context has yet to be examined. This investigation tests this idea by conducting structured interviews with active probationers and parolees centered on their decoding of streetscapes to clarify offenders’ perceptions of street robbery opportunities (Part I). These results inform an agent-based simulation contrasting the merits of assumptions made in the previously stated theories to learn how well each generates realistic concentrations of street robbery (Part II). Support emerges for both environmental criminology and situational action theory, but the results differed by the method employed. Implications follow for clarifying the theoretical processes driving these incidents and for promoting public safety.

AB  - Geography and time are the two constraints on illegal acts. The extant research on terrorism suggests that terrorists make an expected cost-benefit analysis, and thus make bounded, rational choices regarding their attacks. They carry out attacks that are likely to benefit their organizational goals, and they commit attacks choosing the easiest way with the least effort. This assumption leads to the conclusion that their attacks are likely to be clustered over space and time, and hence predictable. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the attacks of the PKK—a separatist terrorist organization—form microcycles in Turkey. In this study, we use the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to examine 1261 terrorist attacks of which locations are known and attributed to the PKK. Our research findings suggest significant evidence to conclude that a pattern exists over both space and time regarding distribution of the terrorist attacks. Results from our logistic regression model demonstrate that non-lethal attacks or those occurring in Istanbul or Ankara are more likely to be contagious. We argue that our research findings and policy implications could be useful to create more effective terrorism prevention strategies and policies.

AB  - Although rational choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, there is a lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of "forensic awareness" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use. Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada. Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness. Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.

AB  - Behavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders. Using a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences. Findings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered -- some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others. The findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.

AB  - Motor vehicle theft costs the United States billions of dollars each year in direct and indirect losses. More specifically, vehicle theft in areas near borders and ports has been cited as a significant growing problem in both academic studies and media reports. Although no reliable measure of international vehicle theft exists, the National Insurance Crime Bureau and other agencies acknowledge that a disproportionate number of vehicles are stolen in cities and towns near borders and ports. Yet, with few exceptions, research studies have not focused on vehicle theft in these high-risk areas. This dissertation utilizes incident-level data from a U.S.-Mexico border area city (Chula Vista, California) and a U.S. port area city (Newark, New Jersey) to investigate vehicle theft patterns related to exporting in the two locations. Two separate analyses were conducted using recovery status and recovery country as dependent variables in logistic regression models. Predictor variables were constructed based on previous research findings and expectations from a rational choice framework. In the multivariate comparison between unrecovered vehicles and recovered vehicles in both sites, few significant predictors emerged. Overall, there were more statistically significant predictors in Chula Vista than in Newark. Specifically, in Chula Vista, unrecovered vehicle thefts are more likely to be larger vehicle types. In a second analysis, vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered in Mexico were compared to a random sample of vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered domestically. Vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered in Mexico are significantly younger and more expensive than vehicles recovered in the U.S. Additionally, sports utility vehicles and pick-up trucks are more likely to be taken to Mexico, while 2-door cars are more likely to be recovered domestically. The current study provides partial support for a link between rational choice perspective’s focus on increasing rewards and professional vehicle theft in Mexico. It appears that less consideration is given to reducing effort and risk by professional thieves in these areas in comparison to amateur thieves. From a policy standpoint, this study indicates that prevention efforts should target certain vehicles in border cities and focus less on space and time.

AB  - As many states, including California, legalized marijuana for medicinal and recreational use, the federal government for the previous 50 years never legally waivered in its position prohibiting cannabis manufacturing, sales, transportation, distribution, and possession. Considered on par with opioids and methamphetamine, cannabis was federally illegal and determined to have no accepted medical use and the highest potential for drug abuse. There was very little literature and a significant gap in qualitative research when considering California's cannabis legalization regulations and their impact on local police officers. Therefore, the generic qualitative study sought to determine how California's local law enforcement officers perceived and were affected by the disparity between state cannabis legalization regulations versus federal cannabis prohibition. The research question asked, considering the opposing federal and state cannabis laws, what were the behaviors, perceptions, attitudes, and lived experiences of police officers in California when dealing with cannabis? A representative sample of experienced, local police officers from California were purposefully selected to voluntarily participate in the study, framing the theoretical perspective in terms of the rational choice theory. The findings revealed that California's ambiguous cannabis regulations were the source of confusion and frustration for police officers who perceived an increased pattern of cannabis use and abuse in their communities with juveniles, intoxicated driving, and within the unregulated criminal cannabis market. The findings further determined that more research was needed to consider the broader implications of California's complicated legalization regulations and the overall impact on California's criminal justice system.

AB  - In the past decade, there has been an exponential adoption and ownership of smartphones by billions of users worldwide. However, as smartphone usage increases, criminals have taken advantage of them for illicit or criminal purposes. In criminal investigations, smartphone data has become an invaluable source of information. This study focuses on constructing a snapshot of Android-operated smartphone data to assist investigators in answering critical investigative questions. A thorough review of the literature with regard to the use of smartphone evidence in criminal cases, with the goal of emphasising the investigative phase and the supportive role of mobile data evidence in guiding investigations will be performed. In order to identify additional persons of interest and develop a thorough understanding of the case, the methodology will entail analysing user profiles, smartphone usage patterns, communication logs, application usage, geographic lookups, and device interactions. By conducting a thorough examination of relevant literature, designing a suitable model, and executing a case study, the study intends to offer valuable perspectives on the creation of timelines or visual representations derived from smartphone data. The results of this study will contribute to improving the efficacy of mobile forensics in assisting investigators and facilitating the use of Android-operated smartphone data as supporting evidence in criminal investigations.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

AB  - In Australia, past and present, Pacific Islanders have been labelled as undesirable others, included to temporarily fill labour shortages as required, controlled while resident in the country and removed when no longer deemed necessary. Pacific Islanders’ experiences in Australia reveal the inception, continuity and durability of differential inclusion produced by border control mechanisms. This paper traces Australia’s history of deporting Pacific Islanders over more than a century: from indentured labour and blackbirding, colonial occupation of Pacific Islands and the White Australia Policy, to more recent patterns of selective inclusion, such as the labour mobility schemes, to the disproportionate effects on Pacific Islanders of modifications to the criteria for deportability introduced in 2014 with the amendments to Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). By tracing the past–present circular border policies, this paper argues that the high number of Pasifika New Zealanders deported from Australia represents a continuation of a regime of differential inclusion.

AB  - People's movements across time and space affect crime opportunities, and in turn, are influenced by the physical environment. Facilities such as bars, shopping malls, schools, and entertainment districts for example affect routine activities and the criminal event. Such places act as crime attractors or generators. Attractors possess crime opportunities, pulling intending criminals who act on these opportunities, while generators do not necessarily draw intending criminals, but possess many opportunities resulting in crime problems. Spectator events such as hockey games draw large numbers of people and may function as crime attractors and/or generators and such impacts on crime patterns have been largely unexplored. This analysis examines the home arena of a local National Hockey League club as a possible attractor/generator.

AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers' incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods.

AB  - The current study examines mass public shooters who target government agents and institutions in the United States. This research uses a rational choice perspective to examine the incidence, motivations, and target selection. Additionally, this work provides an in-depth investigation of ideological attacks, as well as a comparison against general mass public shooting perpetrator, planning, and incident characteristics. Results indicate non-ideological attacks against government targets occur more than ideologically motivated shootings. Importantly, the majority of ideologically motivated mass public shooters do not attack government targets. These findings provide implications for security, policy, and prevention strategies that have historically focused on ideologically motivated mass public shootings against government targets.

AB  - The daily rhythms of the city, the ebb and flow of people undertaking routines activities, inform the spatial and temporal patterning of crime. Being able to capture citizen mobility and delineate a crime-specific population denominator is a vital prerequisite of the endeavour to both explain and address crime. This paper introduces the concept of an exposed population-at-risk, defined as the mix of residents and non-residents who may play an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in a specific crime type, present in a spatial unit at a given time. This definition is deployed to determine the exposed population-at-risk for violent crime, associated with the night-time economy, in public spaces. Through integrating census data with mobile phone data and utilising fine-grained temporal and spatial violent crime data, the paper demonstrates the value of deploying an exposed (over an ambient) population-at-risk denominator to determine violent crime in public space hotspots on Saturday nights in Greater Manchester (UK). In doing so, the paper illuminates that as violent crime in public space rises, over the course of a Saturday evening, the exposed population-at-risk falls, implying a shifting propensity of the exposed population-at-risk to perform active roles as offenders, victims and/or guardians. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and policy relevance of these findings.

AB  - This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment involving subway station closures to examine how subway ridership is associated with the impact of robbery victimization within spatial network buffers immediately surrounding subway stations in Bronx (County), New York. The New York City subway system is the busiest in the USA, with an annual ridership estimated at 1.8 billion people. Key findings of this research include noteworthy relationships between robbery hot spots and subway stations, as well as substantial reductions in robbery frequency during temporary subway station closures, with larger reductions occurring in closer proximities to the subway stations. There was also a significant robbery pattern “normalization process” that occurred after the closed subway stations were reopened where robbery frequency returned to historically “normal” pre-closure levels. These notable decreases of crime in and around subway stations during the station closure time periods, as well as the prominent increases in robbery when subway stations reopened, should be taken into consideration when planning transit maintenance, conducting crime prevention initiatives, and scheduling crime control strategies.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to discover how mass incarceration and other historical methods of racialized social control in the South have preserved and reinforced habits of judgment that adversely affect the social mobility of Black males in Mississippi. A historical research method was employed to locate and analyze recurring themes of habitual judgment patterns justifying age-old systems of social control and how those patterns have influenced the current trend of Black male incarceration at disproportionate rates. Questionnaires were administered to professional employees from the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) in attempt to gather useful data about the socioeconomic backgrounds of the Black male inmate population and identify the key factors for their imprisonment. Theories of crime and deviance were applied to establish and identify relationships between recurring concepts found in existing literature and inferences made from data collected from questionnaires completed by MDOC employees. Findings suggest that disconnections from institutions because of discriminatory practices and social stratification, and the weakening of Black males' bonds to the very institutions of power that prevent crime (e.g., family, education, and employment) as a consequence of imprisonment, enable the reproduction of habits of judgment which manifest through popular culture (e.g., media, literature, etc.) rationalizing public concern. In turn, policies implemented to ensure public safety target disadvantaged Black communities, engender higher rates of arrest and incarceration, and facilitate a vicious cycle of crime and poverty preserving the socioeconomic inferiority of Black males in Mississippi.

AB  - This study looks at the spatial distribution of robbery against residents as a function of nonstationary density and mobility patterns in the most densely populated city in Spain, Barcelona. Based on the geographical coordinates of mobile devices, we computed two measures of density of the ambient population and the tourist presence, for work days, weekends, and holidays in 2019. Negative binomial regressions are then estimated to analyse whether these measures are correlated with the risk of robbery, controlling for land use and the characteristics of the social environment. The model reveals that residents’ chances of being exposed to robbery in Barcelona depend on the social relevance and tourism attractiveness of certain places at particular times of the year. Our results disclose two sources of social disorganization as stronger predictors of the occurrence of robbery in Barcelona, respectively linked to structural processes of residential instability and daily and seasonal mobility patterns. On the one hand, we found that the effect of the density of international tourists on the outcome variable is mediated by residential volatility, which is assumed to be associated with housing shortages in neighbourhoods where short-term vacation rentals are widespread. On the other hand, the ability to exert effective social control is significantly undermined in urban areas, where the ambient population and the volume of tourists outnumber the resident population, thus increasing incidents of robbery victimization. The implications of these findings for urban policy and crime prevention in the Catalan capital are discussed.

AB  - This dissertation proposes that ecological theories are incomplete for explaining both large-scale provisioning of organizational justice and violence precipitating from interpersonal disputes. Ecological theories (e.g., some rational choice theories, human behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology) posit that individuals are capable of maximizing their goals (e.g., fitness) within their environmental constraints. These theories assume that knowledge of human nature and environmental contingencies are enough to explain behavior. In contrast, cultural evolutionary theory proposes that institutions are a central component of human environments. Thus, with mechanistic predictions about the dynamic nature of institutions, cultural evolutionary theory can explain patterns of justice behavior—all other environmental variables held constant—that vary between regions or throughout history. Further, with specific attention to the cooperative nature of justice, cultural evolutionary theory explains how institutional rules are required to promote participation, trust, and legitimacy. Part I of this dissertation describes the institutional rules of Sungusungu “vigilante” organizations that emerged as a grass-roots social movement to control crime. A few organizational chapters were studied in southwestern Tanzania using participant observation and survey methods. First, cultural evolutionary theory is used to explain dynamic patterns of Sungusungu behavior. Second, with attention to ecological and cultural evolutionary theories of cooperation, it is found that institutional rules motivate Sungusungu cooperation, especially on large scales. Finally, methods developed by experimental economists are used to show that institutional rules influence preferences to share and punish between different ethnic groups and at different social scales. Part II uses cultural evolutionary theory and definitions of social control institutions to explain dynamic patterns of male dispute-related violence. Empirical data illustrate ecological theories of mate competition cannot explain historical trends in violence, diversity of institutions in similar environmental conditions, and other seemingly cultural patterns. Finally, homicide data from United States counties are used to test the hypothesis that “culture of honor” institutions are stronger than peacemaking institutions in the rural South. Assuming honor institutions influence age-specific offending rates, the cultural evolutionary hypothesis is supported. Dispute-related homicide rates involve greater relative proportions of older offenders in the rural South as compared to the rural North.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In recent years, along with the development of the urban public transport system, bus pickpocketing crimes have garnered increasing attention. In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes.

AB  - The rise in prescription drug abuse is changing crime patterns among drug users and the structure of illegal drug markets. The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. This study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. The findings of this study indicate that individual-level characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-to-crime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted.

AB  - Individuals with disabilities experience victimization at rates higher than their typically-functioning peers. Because they are often perceived as unreliable reporters, the likelihood that victimizations of individuals with disabilities are reported is low. Data regarding the lived victimization experiences of individuals with specific disabilities are scant. Grounded in the rational choice theory and Cohen and Felson’s routine activity theory, this qualitative study investigated the victimization experiences of school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the rural Southern US. This study involved 21 public school students between the ages of 12 and 17 who were interviewed using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire, second revision. Multiple themes were extricated from interview data through descriptive coding. Students with autism are most likely to be victimized in areas that are unstructured and have inadequate supervision. When a weapon was used during victimization, it was most often a weapon of opportunity, and types of victimization most experienced by students involved chasing, grabbing, or being forced to do something they did not want to do. This study identified fear of punishment and embarrassment as the most considerable barriers to self-reporting victimizations to appropriate authorities. This study’s results can be used by families, educators, and service providers to assist in supporting change for individuals with autism that are at risk for experiencing victimization. Study data may have a positive social impact by preventing victimization through the identification of potential victims, providing situational intervention in high risk areas, and supporting intervention in situations involving victimization for individuals with autism

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders’ knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders’ pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members’ home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge—where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities—and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders’ crime location choices.

AB  - This study was a population-based, retrospective, cohort study that examined the trajectory of domestic violence within individual households as reported via emergency 911 calls. A contextual, multi-level, geographically-referenced model was used to explain the relationships among neighborhood level factors, social disorganization indicators; household factors, number of previous episodes and total number of calls; and the escalation of domestic violence, the interval between calls and the level of severity of episodes, within individual households. The neighborhood data were derived from 1990 U.S. census data. Data on the number of domestic violence calls from individual households, the interval between each call, and the level of severity of the episode were derived from the 1997 emergency 911 database of a large southeastern city in the U.S. The pattern of recurrent calls from individual households was examined. Each emergency 911 call in the sample was coded for a set of variables. Associations among neighborhood variables that included economic status, family structure, racial composition, residential mobility, and structural density and the two outcome measures were examined. To estimate the effects of the neighborhood variables, the emergency 911 calls were linked to their respective census tracts using street addresses. Data were analyzed using a hierarchical approach. Evidence was found for the escalation of domestic violence. The number of days between consecutive episodes of violence decreased as the number of episodes of violence within a household increased. The severity of episodes of violence also increased with each subsequent episode of reported violence from the household. The proportion of female-headed householders with children in a neighborhood, a measure of family structure, was related to both the initial call interval and severity of the initial episodes of violence in households. There was significant unexplained variation among households within neighborhoods for both outcome measures. Further, neighborhood social disorganization was related to the rate of domestic violence in neighborhoods. Emergency 911 call data could provide a promising source of data for a domestic violence surveillance system, especially when linked to other data sources such as official police records.

AB  - Sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators is a particularly worrying phenomenon given that the severity of psychopathological sequelae for the victims are increased when the sexual offense is committed by more than one offender. Preliminary studies showed that sexual violence committed by solo offenders is different from that of duos or groups of offenders. This study explores the heterogeneity within 983 cases of sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators, with a focus not only on offenders’ modus operandi, but also victims’ routine activities and situational aspects of the crime. Results from a latent class analysis identified four offending patterns: sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators where: 1) stranger victims were randomly selected; 2) offenders were geographically mobile; 3) victims were assaulted during social events; and 4) offenders were non-sexually motivated. Findings help identify situational characteristics interacting with offenders’ behaviors and victims’ routine activities associated with sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators. The implications regarding the heterogeneity of criminal patterns in these forms of violence is discussed in relation to police practice, situational crime prevention strategies, and future research.

AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent rational choice plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that power as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - As mobile technology advances and the demand for WiFi and phone coverage increases, electronic device theft is becoming an international problem in metropolitan public transportation systems. Using transit police reports, this dissertation applies crime opportunity theories to understand which factors increased electronic device theft in Boston subway stations from 2003-2011. This approach addresses previous studies regarding crime on public transportation, robbery and larceny on subways and electronic device theft - as none have focused on this problem as the theft of a "hot product" within a "hot environment." Negative binomial regression, crime script analysis, sign tests and temporal pattern identification are used. This study identifies 24 subway stations where electronic device theft is concentrated. The findings suggest that district crime rates and subway station characteristics may help transit police understand why certain stations serve as activity spaces for electronic device theft. It also recognizes "hot times," risky passenger behavior and potential offender tactics. Policy implications and recommendations are discussed.

AB  - ObjectivesWe aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences.MethodsThe data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services.ResultsThe results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders.ConclusionsBy replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.

AB  - The terrorist decision-making process is the key component of understanding the types of attacks terrorists execute, and the group’s ideology is the goal-orientation portion of that rational decision-making process. Terrorist group ideology determines a number of aspects of the decision-making process that expand or limit the targets groups will attack and the tactics they will use to achieve their larger ideological goals. These aspects include: a group’s long-term goals, short-term objectives, an attack’s purpose, the audience, the group’s constituency, its enemies, and its message. Terrorism is a tactic of asymmetrical warfare and a unique form of violent crime. Acts of terrorism and their perpetrators come in a variety of forms, each of which presents a different threat of violence, and occurs within a set of intricate circumstances. Using a database of terrorist group ideologies of my own making, the Global Terrorism Database, Polity IV, the Political Instability Taskforce, and Major Episodes of Political Violence, I establish the link between terrorist ideology and terrorist behavior. I first established the number of terrorist perpetrators of each ideology type and evaluated the assassination, armed assault and bombing attacks they carried out against business, government, police, military and civilian targets. Second, I evaluated ideology’s impact on terrorist behavior controlling for political violence and instability, geographic, time, and country and group-level variables. Finally, I evaluated the behavior of unknown terrorist perpetrators in the aggregate and over time between 1998 and 2013. There are four major findings of this dissertation. First, there is a relationship between terrorist ideology and terrorist behavior. Second, some terrorist behaviors were consistent across ideologies and over time. Third, the geographic and political instability and violence context in which terrorism occurs affects terrorist behavior. Finally, the incidents committed by unknown perpetrators are geographically concentrated and their behavior patterns are similar to the general behaviors of identifiable perpetrators. Counterterrorism researchers and practitioners can use this information to anticipate and counter threats from terrorists of different ideologies and unknown perpetrators.

AB  - The concept of crime displacement has received considerable attention within the crime prevention literature, but the methodology used for much of this research has limitations. Specifically, many of the existing studies that measure the extent of displacement use secondary data sources, such as police records and service calls, which are designed for other purposes. Moreover, the predominant approach for studying displacement has been to observe changes in aggregate crime patterns in and around hot spots targeted for police interventions. Rarely do studies take a micro-level approach to examine displacement from viewpoint of the adapting offender who is forced to change his spatial, temporal and tactical patterns of behavior. This dissertation seeks to further our understanding of the causal mechanisms that produce crime displacement, as well as the cognitive processes that determine which methods of adaptation are likely to result from different intervention strategies. The study seeks to answer three questions: (1) Does the research find evidence of aggregate spatial or temporal displacement effects in the study sites?; (2) What are the social conditions and personal attributes that shape the decision making process relating to displacement?; and (3) How do neighborhood conditions such as the level of physical disorder impact patterns of crime displacement? Furthermore, the dissertation draws from the rational choice literature and environmental criminology to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the micro-level decision making processes involved in offender adaptation. Three study sites in Jersey City, New Jersey were examined using a controlled experimental design. Police intervention strategies that have been shown to produce crime reduction benefits were developed for each of the target areas. The Jersey City Police Department implemented the interventions with a high level of intensity to maximize the potential for crime displacement. Multiple data sources were used to measure various forms of displacement resulting from the interventions. The study draws from interviews with offenders arrested in the target areas, as well as social observations, household surveys and place-manager interviews conducted in the study sites.

AB  - The overall aim of the paper is to present evidence on the factors underpinning historical deportation cases, by exploring the reasons, explanations and patterns related to deportation in Australia. The purpose is to consider whether these historical factors are antecedent to current forms of deportation occurring in Australia, and to bring to the fore potential recurring patterns. Deportation is currently conceptualised by border criminologists as a punitive tool of discipline and control, within the realm of penal powers. Some of this work on the ‘deportation regime’ asserts that certain migrants, or groups of migrants, are undesirable: their identity, (not)belonging and punishment have become inherently intertwined, and their mobility has become politicised and criminalised. This article theorises that deportation has been used in Australia, now and in the past, to expel individuals who are viewed as detrimental to the ‘health’ of the host society. The ‘deportation categories’ demonstrate that migrants’ desirability has historically been a temporary condition, shifting over time in line with the state’s requirements. They also demonstrate the historical regime of criminalisation of undesirable others enacted through Australia’s border control regime.

AB  - This Special Issue is a collection of seven papers that seek to better our understanding of how urban mobility relates to crime patterns, and how day to day movement of people in urban spaces (urban mobility) is related to spatio-temporal patterns of crime. It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both ‘crime type’ appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the ‘dynamic denominator’ challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation. This special issue explores a range of potential solutions to this including mobile/cell phone data, transportation data, land use data, and other possible measures to address this.

AB  - AbstractPrevious research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

AB  - Criminal behavior, which takes its content from society, has been associated with social isolation, national quarantine, and mandatory stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been researched through crime rates. Moreover, it has been argued that changes in the level of social mobility also affect crime rates. Decreased crime rates have been reported during closure measures, and a significant literature has emerged based on these propositions. This study's retrospective approach was created to examine the appearance of crime rates in Türkiye. The main problem of the research is to reveal the relationship between crime, pandemic, and social mobility in Türkiye. For this purpose, it aimed to test the propositions based on a dual approach. First, patterns in crime rates were discovered. The data set regarding the most common crime types between 2018 and 2022, including pre-pandemic crime rates, was used. The most appropriate time series model was determined to understand the data structure regarding crime types, and it was tested whether there was a decrease or increase in crime rates during and after the pandemic. As a second step, the effect of social mobility on the change in crime was examined according to the mobility level data reported in this process. Evidence has shown decreased violence, theft, and drug crimes in the early part of the pandemic, consistent with the literature. While theft crimes decreased throughout the pandemic, violence and drug crimes increased. The view that crime rates will decrease if social mobility is restricted as a source of social life presented overlapping data in the pandemic. Changes in social mobility during the pandemic have affected crime rates for theft, injury, and drug use. Although there was a decrease in crime rates due to seasonal effects after the normalization process, it was observed that crime rates could change according to the content of social measures during the pandemic period. It is considered that this situation presents a particular slice for the future.

AB  - Mobile technologies, specifically smartphones, offer social scientists a potentially powerful approach to examine the social world. They enable researchers to collect information that was previously unobservable or difficult to measure, expanding the realm of empirical investigation. For research that concerns resource-poor and hard-to-reach groups, smartphones may be particularly advantageous by lessening sample selection and attrition and by improving measurement quality of irregular and unstable experiences. At the same time, smartphones are nascent social science tools, particularly with less advantaged populations that may have different phone usage patterns and privacy concerns. Using findings from a smartphone study of men recently released from prison, this article discusses the strengths and challenges of smartphones as data collection tools among disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups.

AB  -  This study examines the crime patterns of New Zealand serial sexual assaulters in order to determine the extent to which such offenders display spatial behaviour in line with their overseas counterparts. Hypotheses concerning journey to crime, criminal range and spatial pattern were tested. Geographical information on 76 serial offenders was extracted from police files and mapped. A series of spatial analyses were conducted in order to examine the spatial mobility of the offenders. It was found that, in line with much overseas research, offenders typically did not travel very far to offend (a median of 3 km) and operated over identifiable criminal ranges. However, in contrast to much overseas research into serial spatial patterns, New Zealand offenders were characterised by transience and commuting patterns of behaviour rather than a predominant marauder style. The implications of these findings for geographic profiling are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The lack of a standardised approach in cross-national spatial crime research limits the creation of consistent, reliable and valid knowledge regarding the spatial dimension of crime and crime causation across contexts. This begs the question: what is the most appropriate or ‘correct’ methodological approach to follow in order to measure crime and its causation in any context? This question is initially answered by undertaking a spatial analysis of crime in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Khayeltisha (the primary study site) is home to one of the most deprived, marginalised, crime-ridden and socially disorganised communities, not only in South Africa but in the world. A largely ineffective police force together with unchecked and informal policing structures, unreliable and uncertain political support have contributed to unmanageable crime. Subsequently, there is a desperate need to generate valid empirical knowledge and an understanding of crime patterns as they relate to the social and economic environment.This study uses social disorganisation as a guiding framework to gain a more thorough theoretical understanding of crime and the ecological characteristics that can affect it within the context of Khayelitsha. The central tenets of the theory, that describe the level of social disorganisation of a place, include socio-economic deprivation, family disruption, residential mobility, racial heterogeneity and urbanisation. These characteristics are however notoriously difficult to quantify and the choice of variables used to represent the central tenets of the theory are often inconsistently interpreted. In the first part of the study, I demonstrate how the numerous ways in which these characteristics can be operationalised continuously yield conflicting results, which raises questions regarding its applicability in a developing context. In the analysis, three separate sets of variables, consistent with social disorganisation theory, are tested using regression modelling, to illustrate these inconsistencies. Results are shown to vary in significance and predicted associations across almost all the individual variables representing the same structural neighbourhood characteristics.This raises the question of appropriate definitions and descriptions of variables together with the suitability of various combinations of variables used as proxies for concepts synonymous with social disorganisation theory. The findings also refutes any assumption that different sets of variables applied as proxies for the same tenets of social disorganisation would perform similarly and bring into question results from the plethora of prior local and international research that have used the social disorganisation theory as a framework to guide the selection of variables in spatial crime analysis.As a solution, in the second part of the study, I propose the use of standardised variables in spatial crime research using variables informed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) indicators. These variables are used to measure social disorganisation in Khayelitsha (in South Africa) and Fort Lauderdale (the secondary and comparative study site in the United States), allowing for a crossnational comparison of the causes of crime in these two contexts. The ISO 37120 indicators, in particular, provide guidelines to create clearly defined, standardised measurements, and consequently consistent indicators comparable over time or space. This is currently lacking in cross-national comparative crime studies applying social disorganisation theory. The indicators promote cross-national information sharing, transparency and open data. Furthermore, this approach offers the benefit of contributing towards the creation of a reliable foundation of globally standardised data, which can assist in building core knowledge, and can be used for comparative knowledge sharing in spatial research of crime.

AB  - Crime in the United States has steadily been decreasing since the 1990s. Social disorganization theory states that breakdowns of social institutions were the root causes of juvenile delinquency. Using exogenous variables of poverty, residential mobility, and ethnic heterogeneity, this study aims to investigate the impacts and magnitude of these variables on violent and property crime committed in the United States for adults and for juveniles. By comparing adult crime rates to juvenile delinquency rates, these findings will guide policy makers to develop effective policy tools that will provide a safer environment for the community. Using annual crime datasets, this thesis looks at decennial years 1990, 2000, and 2010 in the United States at the county level. Identified spatial effects through exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) are used to test on their temporal stability. A set of spatial regression models was developed to estimate the impacts of socioeconomic factors and spatial neighborhood effects on adult crimes and juvenile delinquency rates. Results from this study show crime concentrations and spatial shifts over time and where the greatest concentrations of crime were.

AB  - This exploratory study utilized the official prison, police and court records of 65 convicted males serving prison terms at the Nsawam Medium Security Prison near Accra, Ghana to examine the travel patterns of criminals to Accra's central business district (CBD) to pickpocket in 1996. All the offenders traveled from within metro Accra and Tema, eighteen miles southeast of Accra, to offend in the CBD. The high volume of pickpocketing within the CBD by both residents and nonresidents could be attributed to the concentration and volume of socioeconomic activity within the CBD. The situation has led to unprecedented human traffic and routine activity and has created vulnerabilities and opportunities for crime. Cross jurisdictional criminal activities may have been fostered by enhanced mobility.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In the present study, geographic mobility exhibited by child sex offenders was examined. Geographic mobility was defined as the use of multiple locations to obtain repetitive sexual contact with the same victim. The sample consisted of 77 adult offenders convicted for having committed a sexual offence against a child, and who agreed to provide confidential self-report data concerning their offending behaviours. Based on a set of offence characteristics, offenders who used a single location were compared to offenders who used multiple locations for sexual contact. Results showed that offenders who used multiple locations are more likely to isolate the victim, use violence, involve the victim in several sexual episodes, abuse the victim for a period exceeding one year, and make the victim participate and perform sexual behaviours on them during sexual episodes. Examining more closely offenders who used multiple locations for abuse, three offence patterns were further identified (i.e., familial-low mobility offence, non familial-high mobility offence, and familial-high mobility offence). Going for a car ride was also found to be a common location/situation used in the familial-low mobility offence subgroup, while the use of outdoor locations on a regular basis was found to be rare in high mobility patterns subgroups.

AB  - La surveillance téléphonique est un des principaux moyens utilisés dans les enquêtes sur le trafic de stupéfiants afin de reconstituer l'activité délictueuse, identifier les acteurs impliqués, déterminer leurs rôles respectifs et les localiser. À ce jour, les recherches sur l'exploitation de la téléphonie afin d'étudier des groupes criminels portent principalement sur les transcriptions des communications intégrées dans les décisions de justice. Cette recherche exploratoire bénéficie quant à elle d'un accès privilégié aux données de téléphonie provenant de mesures de surveillance en temps réel et rétroactive durant l'enquête. Cette recherche se focalise sur le lien entre le rôle d'un individu impliqué dans le trafic de stupéfiants et les patterns spatiaux détectés dans les traces téléphoniques. La question de recherche posée est : le rôle d'un acteur, à savoir la fonction qu'il remplit et la place qu'il occupe au sein du groupe, peut-il être inféré à partir de ses activités téléphoniques ? Cet article aborde cette question à travers l'analyse spatio-temporelle des contrôles téléphoniques rétroactifs et en temps réel de 20 individus distincts impliqués dans le trafic de stupéfiants. Les individus sélectionnés sont répartis selon trois rôles : livreurs, grossistes ou semi-grossistes et transporteurs. Pour mesurer leur mobilité, la localisation médiane, l'aire de l'enveloppe convexe, et la moyenne des distances parcourues par jour sont notamment calculées pour chaque individu et par type de rôle. Les résultats soutiennent l'hypothèse selon laquelle le rôle de l'utilisateur influence les patterns observés dans ses données téléphoniques. Les transporteurs semblent ainsi pouvoir être différenciés des livreurs et grossistes selon des patterns géographiques identifiables. Les livreurs semblent également pouvoir être différenciés des grossistes. Ces résultats tendent à confirmer l'approche proposée et révèlent un potentiel d'exploration des données de téléphonie pour inférer le rôle des acteurs dans un trafic.

AB  - Even before the Supreme Court heard arguments, though, the Washington Post had published an article about some federal judges' concern that government searches can overreach and obtain data that isn't relevant to their case, and then retain the data "for unspecified future use." Justice Antonin Scalia likewise raised this issue, according to National Public Radio (NPR), when he "suggested that the rule could limit the search to material relevant to the crime for which the person is arrested."Non-evidentiary content can also be important in authenticating evidence. It can show a subject's state of mind before, during, and after an incident. Language patterns that match the evidence can indicate that the same person authored the messages. Locations and date and time stamps can show a suspect using a device for "normal" as well as criminal activity at the same time as the criminal conduct, showing that someone else couldn't have posted the contraband content from that device at that time.Finally, as the facts of [Riley] and Wurie demonstrate, encounters with suspects in the field don't make it easy to decide how to treat their mobile devices. True forensic analysis doesn't lend itself to the kind of rapid decision-making that's often required to keep yourself and others safe, preserve and collect other forms of evidence, and maintain situational control.Don't be overly particular either. Searching a mobile device may be like searching a house, but naming specific databases isn't as simple as naming rooms. Even when houses' layout differs, the names of different rooms (living room, bedroom, basement) remain consistent.

AB  - The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA) established the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) as the nation's lead agency in the pursuit of sex offenders who violate a sex offender registry and cross state, tribal, or national borders. This study examines the flight behavior of 195 AWA violators investigated by the USMS during 2011 and focuses on the strategic choices fugitives made including the distance offenders traveled, whether they lived alone or with others at capture, and whether they were arrested in a community they were familiar with (e.g., a city they had lived in before). A number of personal, criminal, geographic, and social indicators were taken from law enforcement and public records in an effort to model patterns across these three strategic choices. The data showed that 37% of AWA violators fled to a familiar area, 65% lived with friends or family at capture, and 50% traveled more than 370 miles (with 35% residing in an adjacent state to the last known address). Analyses also showed that these three outcomes varied as a function of offender demographics, geographic history, social networks, and criminal history. Implications for policy and research are discussed. [web URL: http://cad.sagepub.com/content/62/8/983.abstract]

AB  -  Official and victimisation data show that despite falling rates for motor vehicle thefts, much of the EU 'organized crime' related thefts have remained almost stable. Nevertheless, the car-theft market in the EU has changed, and so has the role of traditional destinations for stolen vehicles, such as Eastern Europe. The paper examines the demand, supply, and regulation factors that shape the structures of the vehicle theft market in Bulgaria, and smuggling patterns and offender behaviour in source countries, in particular Spain. We argue that such nuanced historical approach that takes into account a wider range of factors in destination countries can help explain the recent transformations in Europe's vehicle-theft markets.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Various observers have raised the question of how our penal appetite relates to broader patterns of consumption in western societies. Most recently, Ian Loader (2009) has suggested that our appetite for punishment, much like our appetite for ice cream and other high-calorie foods, has been accelerated by broad cultural and policy developments and queried how we might develop strategies to moderate it. The relationship is not simply metaphorical. The prison boom and the food binge, along with the housing bubble, constitute parallel developments in advanced liberal societies. While they may all be reflections of the kind of deeper structural change in these societies often labeled 'neo-liberalism', I would suggest their relationships are often more direct--and that they can possibly be analytically reversed, yielding insights as to how restraint in one domain might be mobilized within another. This essay seeks to back out some ideas about moderation in punishment from emerging strategies to fight obesity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Schools in America may provide opportunities for upward mobility while also perpetuating social inequality. The inequities found in the US public school system probably result in such a highly stratified society. Conditions found in many schools and classrooms are often a microcosm of the same conditions and factors present in the broader American society. Scholars and education reform activists often use the term school-to-prison pipeline to describe what they view as a widespread pattern in the United States of pushing students, especially those who are already at a disadvantage, out of school, and into the criminal justice system. This research explored whether mentorship in the lives of these very students can affect the trajectory that these students take in life by moving toward a pedagogy of liberation that challenges the inequities and contradictions in the institution of education. Building from a model similar to CDF Freedom Schools, but targeting academic enrichment, Farrah and her colleague Hope developed the Sankofa Project at Yin Elementary School (YES). Embracing both the social-emotional and pedagogical aspects of CDF Freedom Schools, the Sankofa Project moved from a mission that sought to instill a love for reading to actually teaching children to read. This aspect was pivotally important to Farrah and Hope as they sought to dismantle the “cradle to prison pipeline,” the concept of funneling masses of people into marginalized lives, imprisonment, and often premature death. Farrah believed that all her predecessors had done “was spot on, but academic enrichment was a key to steering children away from the pipeline.” With the rebirth of a caste-like system in America, black and brown bodies are disproportionately locked behind bars, relegated permanent second-class status if declared a felon and an increasingly common trend toward annihilation at the hands of those of who are designated to serve and protect them.

AB  - COVID-19 impacts the daily lives of millions of people. This radical change in our daily activities affected many aspects of life, but acted as well as a natural experiment for research into the spatial distribution of 911 calls. We analyse the impact of the COVID-19 measures on the spatial pattern of police interventions. Crime is not uniformly distributed across street segments, but how does COVID-19 affect these spatial patterns? To this end, Gini coefficients are calculated and a proportion differences spatial point pattern test is applied to compare the similarity of the patterns of incidents before, during, and after the first lockdown in Antwerp, Belgium. With only essential mobility being allowed, the emergency call pattern has not significantly changed before, during or after this lockdown, however, a qualitative shift in police officer’s daily work may have had an effect on the daily operation of the Antwerp police force.

AB  -  This article reviews evidence from past research that addresses diverse themes and theories regarding shifts and patterns in the mobility of criminal groups. Our main objective is to identify push and pull factors that will help us understand how and why criminal groups, organisations or general organised crime patterns are present across a variety of settings (i.e. geographical locations, criminal markets and legitimate industries). Push factors refer to forces which drive criminal groups from a setting. Pull factors refer to forces which draw criminal groups to a setting. A distinction is also made between contexts in which offenders organise around available opportunities (the strategic context) and contexts in which opportunities induce greater organisational levels amongst offenders (the emergent context). The most general statement that can be formulated from the present exercise is that opportunities matter more than the group itself. What we demonstrate is that the problems concerning geographical locations, criminal markets and legitimate industries that are vulnerable to organised crime are persistent and stable over time. Groups that seize such opportunities, on the other hand, are transient and more than often short-lived. Aside from reviewing past research in search of such factors, we also apply the general understanding that emerges from our analysis to critically assess case studies that reflect popular images of organised crime threats in Canada during recent years. The concluding section identifies the key issues that must be addressed within this area. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article—based on a national data set (N = 173)—focuses on extrafamilial sexual homicides and their spatial mobility. The study combines the location of the crime scene and the offenders and victims’ residences in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the homicides fall within the categories of offender mobility and total mobility. Our results show the validity of the distance decay function, with over 70% of homicides occurring within 10 km of the offender’s residence. It appears that under certain circumstances, sexual murderers perceive their surroundings as a safe place to commit a homicide. Finally, the study proposes a four-category spatial typology of sexual homicide.

AB  - Building on the growing literature on new immigrant destinations, this paper examines new employment patterns of low-skilled Chinese immigrants in the United States. We identify an important channel of employment in new destinations for the case of Chinese low-skilled immigrants: employment agencies in New York City’s Chinatown. We carried out two surveys of employment agencies during 2010–2011. Our findings suggest that there has been a profound change in settlement patterns of low-skilled immigrants: moving away from traditional Chinatowns in major American cities toward non-gateway destinations and rural areas. These new settlement locations are characterized by a low unemployment rate and low crime rate. Contrary to predictions from ethnic economy and mainstream economic perspectives, Chinese restaurant jobs tend not to be in places with a high concentration of Chinese immigrants, but rather in places with a high proportion of non-Hispanic whites. In addition, the farther the jobs are from New York City, the higher the salary. We discuss the implications of this fundamental change for re-conceptualizing the immigrant labor market and immigrant socioeconomic mobility in American society.

AB  - Background:Most cannabis patients engage with dispensary staff, like budtenders, for medical advice on cannabis. Yet, little is known about these interactions and how the characteristics of budtenders affect these interactions. This study investigated demographics, workplace characteristics, medical decision-making, and online behaviors among a sample of budtenders.Methods:Between June and September 2016, a cross-sectional Internet survey was administered to budtenders in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. A total of 158 budtenders fully responded to the survey. A series of comparisons were conducted to determine differences between trained and untrained budtenders.Results:Among the 158 budtenders, 56% had received formal training to become a budtender. Several demographic differences were found between trained and untrained budtenders. For workplace characteristics, trained budtenders were more likely to report budtender as their primary job (74% vs 53%), practice more than 5 years (34% vs 11%), and receive sales commission (57% vs 16%). Trained budtenders were significantly less likely to perceive medical decision-making as very important (47% vs 68%) and have a patient-centered philosophy (77% vs 89%). Although trained budtenders had significantly lower Internet usage, they were significantly more likely to exchange information with patients through e-mail (58% vs 39%), text message (46% vs 30%), mobile app (33% vs 11%), video call (26% vs 3%), and social media (51% vs 23%).Conclusions:Budtenders who are formally trained exhibit significantly different patterns of interaction with medical cannabis patients. Future studies will use multivariate methods to better determine which factors independently influence interactions and how budtenders operate after the introduction of regulations under the newly passed Proposition 64 that permits recreational cannabis use in California.

AB  - Data from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement (AHAA) component of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) was analyzed in order to address two broad research questions: (1) Do student affective and behavioral characteristics affect the probability of mathematics course advancement? and (2) Do mathematics curricular positions contribute to change in behavioral, affective, and performance variables? Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (HGLM) were estimated and provide substantial support for reciprocal relationships between, alternately, involvement in problem behaviors, school performance (grades), and mathematics course taking, net of student background. That is, problem behavior involvement is associated with lower mathematics course placements. In turn, mathematics course placement is associated with change in problem behavior involvement such that higher course placement is related to less involvement and lower course placement with more. As expected, higher mathematics course grades are associated with higher course placement. In turn, course placement is associated with change in mathematics performance such that higher course placements, on average, are related to improvement in grades. Results are discussed in light of Thornberry's (1987) interactional theory of delinquency. None of three interpretive frameworks (i.e. sponsored, contest, and tournament mobility) were found to characterize the pattern of student mobility through the hierarchical mathematics curriculum. Rather, cumulative advantage (CA) was found to best characterize student mobility. That is, in general, the mean course position difference between students in the highest course position and other students widens from one year to the next. Too, three distinct CA mechanisms were identified. The first two mechanisms were identified earlier—higher course positions are associated with change in behaviors and grades. The third mechanism, perhaps more adequately labeled cumulative disadvantage, is related to students in the lowest course position. These students receive a lower status return from their performance (grades), relative to other students, suggesting that their performance is discounted.

AB  - This paper inspects changes in crime trends brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu, India. Using Bayesian structural time-series models, the authors study the changes in two metrics of criminal activity – crime registration and distress calls. In addition to absolute changes, the authors analyse the relative changes in one metric with respect to the other during two stay-at-home orders across six categories of crimes: property offences; offences against the human body; cases of missing persons and unidentified dead bodies; vehicle- and traffic-related offences; crimes against women, children and elders; and emerging crimes. While there was an overall decrease in most types of crime, results show that each category was impacted by restrictions in human mobility in different ways; emerging crimes, in particular, increased significantly during both periods. The crime and call trends exhibited a synchronous pattern with respect to a majority of offences except in the category of crimes against women and missing persons, where a contrary trend of decreasing crime registrations and increasing distress calls was noticed during the partial lockdown period. This finding highlights inherent inadequacies such as under-reporting of crimes by victims and non-registration of crime by the police. Understanding these inadequacies could potentially enhance preparedness leading to improved public service delivery by reordering priorities. Breaking down these trends at a crime-specific level assists law enforcement practitioners in gaining insights on crime motivators and enablers, thus contributing towards more effective crime prevention under ordinary circumstances.

AB  - In the wake of devastating attacks by violent extremists around the world, policy makers have invested considerable effort into understanding terrorists’ use of the Internet as they radicalize and mobilize to violence. To that end, the article “Terrorist Use of the Internet by the Numbers: Quantifying Behaviors, Patterns, and Processes” by Paul Gill, Emily Corner, Maura Conway, Amy Thornton, Mia Bloom, and John Horgan (2017, this issue) contributes important data to a timely policy discussion. The authors’ central finding, “that there is no easy offline versus online violent radicalization dichotomy to be drawn,” highlights a gap in our current conceptualization of the radicalization process and suggests several implications, particularly for countering violent extremism (CVE) policies and programs.

AB  - This study makes use of a dataset recently collected among young people in Stockholm, Sweden (N = 1122), to investigate the impact of fear on young people’s mobility and precautionary behaviour, after controlling for previous victimization as well as situational characteristics of daily trips. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and logistic regression models underlie the methodology of the study. Previous victimization, especially for sexual crimes, triggers precautionary behaviour among young people using trains and the metro. Signs of poorly maintained transit environments also affect young riders’ mobility patterns, as they state that they avoid particular stations or routes at particular times. Informed by principles of environmental criminology and the theory of fear of crime, the implications of the findings for both theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Criminal victimization is known to influence households' moving decisions, but theories suggest that the processes leading to a moving decision can vary across racial and ethnic groups. Drawing from current literature, we hypothesized that victimization would have a stronger effect on moving decisions for Whites than for Blacks or Hispanics, and that racial/ethnic residential segregation would moderate the impact of victimization on mobility. Using a longitudinal sample of 34,134 housing units compiled from the National Crime Victimization Survey for the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States (1995-2003), we found results that both support and contradict the hypotheses. Specifically, White residents display consistent evidence that victimization is a significant predictor of household mobility. Blacks and Hispanics, in contrast, are more varied in their moving behavior after victimization. In addition, significant differences exist among these groups in responses to victimization and in how mobility is influenced by residential segregation. Higher levels of residential segregation play a part in the victimization-mobility relationship among Blacks in a way that is more complex than we hypothesized.

AB  - ObjectivesRoutine activity theory suggests that levels of crime are affected by peoples’ activity patterns. Here, we examine if, through their impact on people’s on- and off-line activities, COVID-19 restriction affected fraud committed on- and off-line during the pandemic. Our expectation was that levels of online offending would closely follow changes to mobility and online activity—with crime increasing as restrictions were imposed (and online activity increased) and declining as they were relaxed. For doorstep fraud, which has a different opportunity structure, our expectation was that the reverse would be true.MethodCOVID-19 restrictions systematically disrupted people’s activity patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions well-suited to testing the effects of “interventions” on crime. We exploit those conditions using ARIMA time series models and UK data for online shopping fraud, hacking, doorstep fraud, online sales, and mobility to test hypotheses. Doorstep fraud is modelled as a non-equivalent dependent variable, allowing us to test whether findings were selective and in line with theoretical expectations.ResultsAfter controlling for other factors, levels of crime committed online were positively associated with monthly variation in online activities and negatively associated with monthly variation in mobility. In contrast, and as expected, monthly variation in doorstep fraud was positively associated with changes in mobility.ConclusionsWe find evidence consistent with routine activity theory, suggesting that disruptions to people’s daily activity patterns affect levels of crime committed both on- and off-line. The theoretical implications of the findings, and the need to develop a better evidence base about what works to reduce online crime, are discussed.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities, as measured by changes in public transport passenger numbers.MethodThe first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors.ResultsResults indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that some of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the findings suggested that the changes in mobility explain part of the declines observed, with important variations per crime type.ConclusionThe findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explicitly test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider how the national intelligence model (NIM) of policing in Britain has been affected by changing patterns of mobility, since its inception in 2004. Design/methodology/approach - Conceptually, the paper draws on the "new mobilities paradigm". Empirically, it is based on a small, exploratory study, comprising analysis of investigations carried out over a three-month period in 2007 and 2008, by a serious and organised crime unit in a police force in England, and 11 interviews carried out in three police forces in England. The data are used for illustrative purposes only. Findings - It is argued that increased levels of mobile criminality are impacting significantly on British police forces, placing considerable strain on the practical structures which underpin the NIM, and posing serious challenges to operational efficiency and effectiveness. Originality/value - This paper makes a contribution by linking the social changes documented in the emergent social science field of "mobilities study" with changes in the organisation of criminality, particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality, which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational as well as "lower level" crime. Examining this phenomenon enables us to see that despite the attention paid to transnational policing in the organised crime literature, the burden of policing both organised and opportunistic crime continues to fall upon local police forces.

AB  - The present study examined whether variations in social ecological conditions in New York City police precincts and divisions have predicted patterns of police misconduct from 1975 to 1996. The study included misconduct cases involving bribery, extortion, excessive force, and other abuses of police authority, as well as certain administrative rule violations. Using a longitudinal framework, the analyses found that dimensions of structural disadvantage and population mobility drawn from the social disorganization literature-as well as changes in Latino population-drawn from the racial conflict perspective explained changes in police misconduct over time. Further, most of the variations occurred within, as opposed to between, precincts and divisions over time, strengthening the case for a longitudinal examination.

AB  - Interpersonal crimes such as aggravated assault greatly impacts upon an individuals’ sense of personal safety and security as the crime results in a physical injury. Understanding where and when aggravated assaults are most likely to occur is therefore vital to minimize the victimization risk associated with this crime. The main aim of this study is to explore the relative importance of space and time in aggravated assault victimization. This was done using national level aggravated assault data (2008-2010) obtained from New Zealand Police and census data from Statistics New Zealand. Both the spatial and temporal distribution of aggravated assault are outlined to examine their association with aggravated assault victimization. Aggravated assault is found to cluster in space but not in time. The relationships between aggravated assault risk in space and time and a suite of social, economic, and lifestyle variables was then examined. A clear socioeconomic gradient was found between aggravated assault risk by space and all neighborhood characteristics with high-risk neighborhoods having greater residential mobility and ethnic/racial diversity, as well as being more deprived, having higher rates of unemployment, and lower median household incomes. No clear pattern emerged between aggravated assault by time and the selected neighborhood characteristics. The policy implications of these findings in terms of policing and diversity conclude.

AB  - It is the fact that crime affects all aspects of human life. Shooting crime has long been a major and serious problem of some US cities.  According to 2017 national statistics, Cleveland was ranked as the 5th, Cincinnati as the 9th, and Columbus as the 21st deadliest city in the US. The analysis of any historical crime data reveals that crime is non-randomly distributed in time and space. Based on this notion, hot spots policing has gained its momentum to effectively predict future crime locations and to direct limited resources of the police to the places where the need is greatest. Hots spots policing approach tries to predict shooting locations ahead of time to increase the quality of life. Recent studies; however, pointed out that traditional hot spots policing occasionally predict rare crimes such as homicides and shootings due to their less frequent recurring counts in a given place and time (specifically for shorter time periods such as weeks and months). Given this context, we developed a new shooting prediction system (SHOPS) to explore whether recent dynamic/mobility activity patterns of known violent individuals increase the prediction of short-term fatal and non-fatal shootings compared to the traditional hot spots policing. Findings suggest that SHOPS predicts fatal and non-fatal shooting locations more precisely by identifying fewer hotspot locations. Policy implications of the study were discussed in the conclusion section.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are already driving on some of the nation’s streets and highways. This technology is advancing quickly and will likely diffuse rapidly throughout society. AVs are likely to reduce traffic collisions and prevent motorist deaths, but only if those motorists become passengers, not drivers, thus eliminating human error as a traffic safety hazard.With the traffic safety benefits of the AV, there will be little need for the traffic enforcement conducted by police and highway patrol agencies across the country today. Yet traffic stops are the most common form of face-to-face contact between police officers and citizens, and traffic enforcement has been a form of crime detection, deterrence and disruption in this country since the dawn of the conventional automobile.[1] This research examines the rising use of AV technology and its effects on police use of traffic enforcement to disrupt crime and terrorism. In doing so, it asks the following questions:* Once all cars drive themselves, what will the increase in traffic safety cost society in terms of public safety?* What can public safety and homeland security policymakers do about it?* RESEARCH DESIGNWhile AVs are not yet widely used, they are likely to become a disruptive innovation that will displace transportation industry jobs and eliminate the need for today’s traffic enforcement model. This phenomenon’s potential impact on public safety is not discussed in any known literature on AV technology, nor does it seem to be on the radar of police executives or public policymakers. The research addresses a potential gap in public safety that may be an unintended consequence of AVs’ traffic safety advantages.To illustrate that gap, traffic stops are examined through the lens of existing literature, including Bureau of Justice Statistics data, sociological and demographic studies, police and legal journals, and relevant case law. The impact of traffic enforcement on crime and public safety is described using existing published articles, as well as traffic stop case studies and subsequent criminal investigations. Related effects are expressed using a diffusion-of-innovations model and examples of plausible future scenarios. Theories on innovation in organizations, including government, are applied as potential means to bridge the foreseen gap between traffic safety and public safety after AV technology diffusion. Among these are signals theory and “nowcasting,” tools that innovators use to “predict the present” by reading signs that the convergence of technology and culture will require pivots in organizational strategic planning.[2]FINDINGSWhile it is impossible to accurately predict the rate of AV diffusion or how quickly such diffusion will affect traffic enforcement strategies, there is consensus that AVs will represent a significant part of the automotive market within the next ten to twenty years.[3] But from a nowcasting perspective, existing signals indicate that AV diffusion could happen much faster. These signals include: increased urbanization and associated traffic and parking congestion; permissive, even encouraging, regulatory environments such as Smart City initiatives; the popularity of vehicles with semiautonomous features; and the proliferation of disruptive innovations in transportation sectors such as Uber, Lyft and Zipcar.[4]While the timetable for change remains uncertain, AVs will reduce the need for police to enforce traffic laws, leading to a diminished capacity for police to detect and deter crime in the same ways they do today. Criminals may imagine ways to capitalize on reduced enforcement, leading to less detection of previously undiscovered crimes and criminals; decreased interdiction of crimes involving vehicles, such as drug smuggling and human trafficking; and the potential for terrorists to weaponize vehicles that can drive themselves with very little risk of being stopped by the police. Further disruptive technologies will require law enforcement and homeland security agencies to innovate in order to ensure public safety with diminished traffic enforcement capacity.ANALYSISIn order to avoid being overwhelmed by criminal exploitation of AV technology, policymakers—with leadership and guidance from law enforcement agency (LEA) executives—must not take a wait-and-see approach. LEAs must not leave public safety issues raised by AV proliferation to regulatory agencies—such as departments of transportation or motor vehicles—but must take the lead in anticipating and responding to them. To develop effective strategies, LEAs will have to collaborate with AV technology companies in the present to anticipate future public safety risks. Such collaboration could serve the goals of LEAs as well as industry. Safer products are more marketable products, and companies that work with law enforcement for the benefit of public safety may have an advantage over those that do not. Such discussions could help police discover problems they did not know existed and solutions they did not know were needed.Beyond new models of collaboration, new methods of policing and new types of police professionals may be required to keep future cities safe. Specifically, traffic agencies will have to pivot from traditional traffic enforcement to technology-based solutions to traffic safety and security. To do so, police professionals will have to imagine a different world—one without traffic enforcement as they know it—and envision how they want that world to look. In order to innovate on behalf of public safety, LEAs need to assert influence over, and adapt to, such a world starting now. They will also need to overcome cultural inertia—a resistance to change that is inherent to government, and to which their agencies are not immune.RECOMMENDATIONSAV technology is no longer nascent—it is here. To follow are practices LEAs can employ today, as well as courses policymakers can set toward a long-term public safety strategy for dealing with the unstoppable cars of tomorrow.*  Lead the Way1. LEAs with traffic responsibilities should become the subject matter experts on the impact of AV technology on public safety. Policymakers should rely on such expertise to mitigate related public safety threats. Traffic enforcement agencies should continue to leverage their expertise and reputations on matters involving the AV by:* Increasing their accident investigators’ and public information officers’ knowledge about AV technology.* Joining industry groups to engage with AV manufacturers on public safety issues.* Educating the public about semi- and fully autonomous technology.* Continuously evaluating AV and associated technologies for potential threats to public safety, as well as innovative solutions to such threats.*  Collect Data1. LEAs and other public agencies should begin collecting data about how AVs are used and how semi- and fully autonomous technology affects public safety. Collection methods should be evaluated and sources appropriately modified as technology changes and AV usage increases. Data sources should include, but not be limited to:* Traffic collision reports with check boxes that indicate levels of autonomy and whether autonomous features affected the outcome of the collision.* Crime reports that indicate if and how an AV was used in the crime.* Business licenses involving AV and related infrastructure technologies.* AV registration records.*  Incorporate Public Safety into Cyber-Physical Infrastructure1. Public safety organizations must be integrated into the cyber-physical infrastructures of the future. As vehicles become increasingly connected to everything, the related data production could lead to safer vehicle operation and could be used to detect and solve crimes. LEAs should engage with transportation agencies and city planners to maximize public safety and crime control opportunities. AVs should meet prescribed requirements in order to operate within certain infrastructures. Such requirements might include:* Scanners that evaluate vehicle sensor failure, software vulnerabilities, malware or hacks.* Software that ensures AVs yield or stop to signals sent by police and other emergency vehicles.* Electronic signatures that report vehicle registration information, commercial licensing and insurance status.* Preservation of data collected by cyber-connected sensors and software, license plate reader cameras, GPS signals or other means in order to track vehicles’ historical movements. Such data could have implications not just for solving known crimes or stopping crimes in progress, but for predictive policing methods associated with vehicles’ patterns of criminal activity.*  Legislate and Regulate1.1. The legality for police to use data collected from infrastructure will depend on how well lawmakers understand the relationship of traffic enforcement on crime detection and deterrence. If police and policymakers pay attention to the AV’s effect on this relationship early, they could create substitutes for the traffic stop as a crime-fighting tool. Now is the time to consider how public safety threats can be addressed through regulation, as companies will be eager to enter a burgeoning and lucrative market. Over the long term, AVs will change expectations of privacy on the highway, presenting policymakers with an opportunity to create a future that puts public safety first. Instead of judges deciding the legality of particular searches after the fact, legislators could consider issues of privacy and security, debate them openly, and pass laws that give clear search and inspection guidelines to police.*  Train and Hire for the Future1. Police agencies today must begin training and hiring for an uncertain future. While AV diffusion will affect the way many departments do business, it is unclear how long the change will take or how dramatic it will be. In order to position themselves for the future, police agencies will have to increase their traffic enforcement officers’ competencies. They must also become savvier about general law enforcement, especially as it relates to technology, as cyber-physical technology will become one of the crime-detection tools of tomorrow. Training considerations should include:* High-tech accident investigation training to help determine fault in vehicles with semi- and fully autonomous capabilities.* Advanced training in highway interdiction, including search and seizure training related to vehicle stops.* Increased general law enforcement training for agencies with a traffic enforcement focus to prepare for a pivot toward more traditional policing roles.Agencies should also consider hiring more law enforcement professionals for non-sworn positions that bring different skills to policing than uniformed officers—something that could become more relevant in a post-traffic enforcement environment. Such positions should be highly paid and respected within the agencies to ensure recruitment and retention of quality personnel with an interest in a long-term career. Existing positions that might be hired in increased numbers include:* Crime analysts.* Evidence and forensic technicians.* Computer forensics technicians.* Information and technology support staff.Some new positions to consider creating include:* Computer code programmers.* Cyber-security technicians.* Surveillance technicians.* Technology company liaison officers or technicians.* An agency futurist to advise LEA executives on emerging technology and its potential impact on the mission of the agency.* STOPPING THE UNSTOPPABLEHistorically, law enforcement has risen to challenges and adapted to new roles to meet those challenges. Traffic enforcement was one such challenge—a role that was never imagined by police in the years before the advent of the automobile. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, police did not consider themselves a bulwark against terrorism; yet, today, they are on the front line of the fight against it. In the years to come, the unstoppable AV will cause the role of traffic enforcement to change once again, but police will still be expected to fight crime and terrorism. Stopping the unstoppable will require innovation in crime detection and resistance to organizational inertia that denies such change is needed.[1] Lynn Langton and Matthew Durose, Police Behavior during Traffic and Street Stops, 2011 (NJC 242937) (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice), 2, http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ pbtss11.pdf.[2] Amy Webb, The Signals are Talking (New York: PublicAffairs, 2016); Hyunyoung Choi and Hal Varian, “Predicting the Present with Google Trends,” Economic Record, 88 (June, 2012): 2–9.[3] Cadie Thompson, “Elon Musk Has a Stunning Prediction for What Cars Will be Like 10 Years from Now,” Business Insider, February 13, 2017, http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-predicts-most-cars-will-be-driverless-in-10-years-2017-2; “Autonomous Vehicle Adoption Study,” Boston Consulting Group (BCG), accessed February 14, 2017, http://www.bcg.com/expertise/industries/automotive/ autonomous-vehicle-adoption-study.aspx.[4] Jeffrey Zients and John P.

AB  - Background Given fathers' potential role in bringing about desired child welfare case outcomes, researchers have begun to identify factors that impact agency efforts to identify and involve fathers. Racial-ethnic inequality and bias are not among factors studied, despite longstanding evidence that racial-ethnic minority children make up a disproportionate share of the child welfare population. Objective We set out to identify racial-ethnic patterns in initial casework activity with nonresident fathers and explore whether select factors explain racial-ethnic differentials. Participants and Setting Caseworkers of 1,754 children in foster care in four U.S. states were surveyed. Methods Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with whether agencies identified, located, and contacted nonresident fathers. Results Agencies were less likely to identify nonresident fathers of Black, Latinx, and Multiracial children, relative to those of White children. Among fathers whom agencies identified, Black and Latinx fathers were less likely to be located. Among fathers whom agencies located, Black and Latinx fathers were less likely to be contacted. Whereas greater rates of international mobility among Latinx fathers explained agencies' disproportionately low rates of contact, no other factor explained racial-ethnic differentials. Conclusion We find evidence of historical racial-ethnic disproportionalities across the three initial stages of casework practice with nonresident fathers in U.S. child welfare systems. Though more recent data are needed, this research suggests that racial-ethnic minority foster children are more likely than White foster children to be denied the benefits of agency-father contact, whether due to societal or systemic racial inequalities.

AB  - Recent theoretical and methodological advances in urban sociology, including spatially located data, provide new opportunities to consider the joint influence of mobility and place in urban social life. This review defines the concept of activity space, describes its origins in urban sociology, and examines the extent to which activity space approaches advance sociological research in four substantive domains-spatial inequality and segregation, social connectedness and engagement, crime and offending patterns, and health and health-related behavior. It next describes the evolution of methods for location tracking and new approaches that hold promise for maximizing urban mobility and activity space contributions. It then discusses how location data may be augmented to enhance our sociological understanding of the structure, meaning, and implications of the places people visit or traverse in daily life. We close with new directions for activity space research, emphasizing how such work could enable comparative contextual research.

AB  - Government responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on mobility patterns with implications for public safety and crime dynamics in countries across the planet. This paper explores the effect of stay‐at‐home guidelines on thefts and robberies at the neighborhood level in a Latin American city. We exploit neighborhood heterogeneity in the ability of working adults to comply with stay‐at‐home recommendations and use difference‐in‐differences and event‐study designs to identify the causal effect of COVID‐19 mobility restrictions on the monthly number of thefts and robberies reported to police across neighborhoods in Montevideo (Uruguay) in 2020. Our results show that neighborhoods with a higher share of residents with work‐from‐home jobs experienced a larger reduction in reported thefts in relation to neighborhoods with a lower share of residents with work‐from‐home jobs. In contrast, both groups of neighborhoods experienced a similar reduction in the number of reported robberies. These findings cast light on opportunity structures for crime but also on how crime during the pandemic has disproportionately affected more vulnerable areas and households.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a decline in the relative Black effect on violent crime in recent decades and interpret this decline as resulting from greater upward mobility among African Americans during the past several decades. However, other assessments of racial stratification in American society suggest at least as much durability as change in Black social mobility since the 1980s. Our goal is to assess how patterns of racial disparity in violent crime and incarceration have changed from 1980 to 2008. We argue that prior studies showing a shrinking Black share of violent crime might be in error because of reliance on White and Black national crime statistics that are confounded with Hispanic offenders, whose numbers have been increasing rapidly and whose violence rates are higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks. Using 1980-2008 California and New York arrest data to adjust for this "Hispanic effect" in national Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data, we assess whether the observed national decline in racial disparities in violent crime is an artifact of the growth in Hispanic populations and offenders. Results suggest that little overall change has occurred in the Black share of violent offending in both UCR and NCVS estimates during the last 30 years. In addition, racial imbalances in arrest versus incarceration levels across the index violent crimes are both small and comparably sized across the study period. We conclude by discussing the consistency of these findings with trends in economic and social integration of Blacks in American society during the past 50 years. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - We apply intersectional frameworks and use a nationally representative dataset to investigate patterns of differential access to social capital among six racial and gender groups. We define social capital as resources controlled by individuals’ social contacts. Individuals can mobilize those contacts to facilitate their actions. We characterize one’s access to social capital with three indicators: the average occupational prestige score of individuals’ social contacts (average), the highest occupation reached among individuals’ contacts (reach), and the number of positions accessed (network diversity). Concerning the average score of one’s social contacts, our findings support the double jeopardy approach, with a simple hierarchy of gender and race/ethnicity: all men have a higher average score than their women counterparts. However, although white men have the highest average score in their social contacts, black women have the highest reach and highest network diversity, net of effects from mediating controls. We discuss implications of our research for future studies of social capital, on the one hand, and intersectionality, especially as it relates to the notions of black male and Latino male vulnerability, on the other.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study is to examine small area variation in crime trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales. While we know how police-recorded crime responded to lockdown policies at the 'macro' level, less is known about the extent to which these trends were experienced uniformly at localized spatial scales. Methods Longitudinal k-means clustering is used to unpick local area variation in police notifiable offences across England and Wales. We describe the clusters identified in terms of their spatial patterning, opportunity structures and crime type profile. Results We find that in most small areas, crime remained fairly stable throughout the pandemic. Instead, a small number of meso-level areas contributed a disproportionately large amount to the macro-level trend. These were typically city centers with plentiful pre-pandemic crime opportunities, dominated by theft and shoplifting offences. Conclusion Findings offer support for opportunity theories of crime and for a mobility theory of crime during the pandemic. We explore potential implications for policy, theory and further research.

AB  - IntroductionAs a result of its drugs- and gang-related violence, in 2011, the city of Springfield, Massachusetts was ranked the twelfth most violent city in the United States, according to data gathered from the Uniform Crime Report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). [1] The rise in violence followed the inundation of gangs in the city. Since 2009, the number of identified organized gangs that have chapters in Springfield has risen sharply. In a single year, the number climbed from 28 to 37 gangs, bringing the city’s gang membership to more than 2,800 people. [2] Arriving around 2009 in the North End of Springfield in particular, was a gang called Los Boricuas that came from a mountainous region in Puerto Rico and set up criminal operations including rampant open air drug markets, strong arm robberies, and intimidation. This led to a turf battle between them and the existing local gangs over who would control that territory. It culminated in several shootings and murders. This gang was exerting its control through intimidation and went so far as to have lookouts riding around on motor scooters with an SKS rifle strapped on their backs. Gang members were walking into stores and taking whatever they wanted while flashing guns to the clerks. None of these crimes were being reported because there was a level of apathy and fear in the community.Much like insurgents in a failed state, gangs thrive on community apathy, an environment wrought of fear, despair, or indifference in which the population in these areas passively permits continued criminal activity and undermines policing efforts. To alleviate these conditions, select police departments around the country have begun to adapt counterinsurgency (COIN) inspired tactics that are based on several principles, including building and maintaining legitimacy within the community, emphasizing intelligence-driven operations, and focusing on unity of effort among all service providers. [3]The Massachusetts State Police (MSP) Special Projects Team instituted a new policing method in the fall of 2009, called “Counter Criminal Continuum (C3) Policing,” to help address gang crime in the North End of Springfield, one of the most depressed neighborhoods of the city. C3 policing was advanced by troopers returning from the overseas war on terror with specialized skill sets, adapting COIN principles originally developed to battle insurgents by Army Special Forces (Green Berets) to domestically target gangs. Based on these principles, C3 aimed to build rapport with the community and underscore unity of effort among the community, local police, and state police.C3 policing is designed around a campaign plan that utilizes eight building blocks as the foundation of the program. These blocks are: gang demobilization, community outreach meetings, street leader program, youth and parental workshops, anti-gang messaging/information operations, business and community leader development, law enforcement and civil community engagements, and law enforcement operations. [4] The end state of the process, ideally, is a re-shaping of the community environment, which makes it inhospitable for gangs, drugs, and violent criminal behavior.Research QuestionAn objective and current analysis of the true effect of the C3 counterinsurgency inspired policing model on the community is needed. Which metrics of change in the quality of life within the North End of Springfield most accurately assess the efficacy of C3 counterinsurgency inspired policing? More broadly, is there a “flip side of the COIN”? That is, are there unintended consequences associated with the C3 policing model?Problem StatementThe C3 policing model marks a significant departure from the way policing has traditionally been conducted in the North End of Springfield. Past practices of traditional and community policing models have been unsuccessful, creating the need for the implementation of the C3 model. C3 may, or may not be more expensive to support, but it most certainly does require reprioritizing budget decisions and outlays. It could quite possibly affect the way the department trains and equips the members or possibly even the way officers for certain positions are recruited. Meanwhile, it is yet to be seen whether the C3 method of policing has shown convincing, positive, measurable results in terms of the quality of life in this area.However, there is an undercurrent of concern among critics of the military nexus in social science research and application; they warn that applying a counterinsurgency approach in domestic law enforcement, regardless of how it is labeled, risks casting local communities as hostile populations. Such overused terms as “the war on crime,” “the war on drugs,” or “the war on terror” exacerbate this blurring of the lines and the civil-military and practical problems that arise in the process. The same is true for the journalistic and professional commonplace practice of police calling many urban areas combat or war zones.Events in Ferguson, Missouri at the time of the writing of this thesis provide an opportunity to engage in a public conversation and reflect upon issues like race relations, civility, and the kind of communities in which we wish to live. In that case, a young man lost his life as the result of a police action, and the response to the ensuing civil disobedience by law enforcement has highlighted law enforcement tactics and the militarization of the police. How the police respond to large-scale disturbances and misinformed perceptions with respect to the 1033 Program, which makes military surplus equipment available to local law enforcement agencies, should not be allowed to hijack the conversation. [5] So before we allow the discussion to be derailed by those engaged in lawlessness or by well-intended academics, social activists, or the media, it is time to explore and reveal the perceptions of the public in this community that we are duty-bound to protect—those who are the real stakeholders. [6]With all this in mind, is it possible to promote a positive collaboration and interaction with community leaders and residents with the C3 approach? Does this method help or hinder our efforts of providing a safe environment through police-citizen partnerships, with an emphasis on mutual trust, integrity, fairness, and professionalism?HypothesisIf the C3 method of policing has been effective in countering gang activity, then there should be a measurable change in crime, and the overall quality of life should show improvement. To test this hypothesis, data was collected from various published city and neighborhood sources to analyze the effects of C3 policing on the community. Indicators, such as litter, graffiti, crime statistics, economy, housing, and crime-related medical calls, should afford a broader understanding of the actual effects on the community than crime statistics alone could provide. Springfield provides a unique research opportunity in this regard because it has more than five years of statistical data, raw information, and documentation of the implementation of the C3 effort.The metrics analyzed thus far have been completely based on quantitative indicators. This is typically how COIN-based strategies are graded. [7] The recognized standard has been using two categories to assess this data. The first is an effects-based assessment that requires researchers to track the results of specific events in the target area over time and build a picture of campaign momentum. The second is pattern and trends analysis that identify various metrics for study and also identifies trends in each over time. That is why the metrics for the two years preceding C3 and four to five years since the implementation were collected. This classic COIN approach is similar to the methods used in this study. It must be remembered though, that the debate continues regarding the correct method of analyzing COIN efforts, and no single model has yet been deemed appropriate. [8]Reviewing the results of this case study revealed some expected and unexpected outcomes. Although there were some clear and definitive trends, there were also indiscernible ones as well. Most of the economic and some of the health data were unsuccessful in showing positive trends. However, examples of school impacts, such as truancy rates and delinquency, show positive signs. Looking at crime through arrests and calls for service reveal a neighborhood that is becoming more involved with law enforcement and that perhaps trust and legitimacy are indeed being established since the implementation of C3. Increased community involvement was also apparent in the political realm as the number of registered voters continued to climb; this is sometimes an indicator of “voting for a change.” Lastly, positive trends were apparent in both instances of graffiti and litter, which indicates that this community is making it less hospitable for gang activity to develop and flourish.FindingsAlthough some argue quite convincingly a contradictory view, the violence, drug activity, and criminal behavior that we see in Springfield’s North End do not constitute an insurgency. Criminal gangs have no ideology beyond their own profit, no political aspirations what so ever, and only achieve passive community support through violence or intimidation. Gangs are nothing more than basic criminal entities. Some COIN principles and practices can, however, support the current law-enforcement strategy aimed to detect, deter, and degrade gangs. The effectiveness of these efforts seem to depend more on deepening reciprocal trust and building legitimacy in the police than perhaps on the application of all of the lessons learned overseas during the global war on terror to Springfield’s inner city neighborhoods.Without a doubt, COIN strategy is a military strategy; however, the basic skills of working with and through the community, intelligence driving operations, and conducting investigations are all fundamental law enforcement practices. Through many conflicts, the military has learned and honed these specific skills, eventually applying them with success through their special operations communities (U.S. Army Special Forces Green Berets). Now is the time for new ideas, such as C3 policing that examines these practices and creates that which has always been missing in community policing: a defined strategy to confront criminal street gangs. C3’s COIN gang strategy provides the advantage of strong agency and community relationships to identify, target, and remove the gangs through the use of intelligence driven operations. When properly administered and executed, this strategy of intelligence-driven targeting and operations should be the most effective and efficient means to detect, deter, degrade, and dismantle criminal gang activity in the city of Springfield.Policy RecommendationsThe recent appointment of a new police commissioner in the city of Springfield has prompted the request for a city wide expansion of the C3 program. Prior to such a commitment by the department, the following recommendations are made based upon the information revealed in this thesis:RecommendationBased upon the findings contained within this thesis, the selection of prospective officers for any C3 assignment should take into account the multidisciplinary skills required of COIN inspired policing, many of which may not be obtained in traditional law enforcement training. The current C3 team was hand selected based upon prior experience both in law enforcement and military deployments, language, and technical skills. The tasks and organization of the team are unique to the mission, tactical situation, and the technical, cultural, and social terrain. Therefore, training should be developed and offered to reflect the department’s commitment to this initiative if our expectations are to entertain its expansion. Failure to commit the proper personnel with the appropriate skills, training, and motivation could ultimately result in the failure of this proposed expansion.RecommendationThe research shows that in regard to expanding C3 into new communities, law enforcement should seek invitation and permission from the community prior to commencing operations. The neighborhood should be the initiator of the contact as opposed to being arbitrarily selected by either law enforcement or the city administration. The community must have a desired interest in the outcome and be willing to be an active participant in the effort. It is imperative to its success that law enforcement is able to identify and work with the true local leaders and to enlist the support of local community groups. Building legitimacy is crucial to achieving these goals. Ultimately, the ability to mobilize the population against the gang problem depends on good relations between the community and police. Ideally, the end state of the process is a re-shaping of the community environment to make it inhospitable for gangs, drugs, and violent criminal behavior.RecommendationFor C3 policing to succeed, a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement, public health, public works, school officials, and non-government organizations should be assembled and mobilized in the planning phases before operations commence. This “working group” should conduct a mission analysis and develop an “implementation plan” including, but not limited to, the following:* Analyze the community’s concerns* Analyze the departments mission, intent, and expectations* Determine specified, implied, and essential tasks* Determine constraints, prohibitions, and restrictions* Construct a timeline with stated goals* Develop themes and messages (intra-agency, inter-agency, media, and public)* Establish course of action evaluation criteria (metrics)* Conduct a cost analysis to explore the feasibility of implementationRecommendationCritics of the military nexus in social science research and application warn that applying a counterinsurgency approach in domestic law enforcement, regardless of how it is labeled, risks casting local communities as hostile populations. Over used terms, such as “the war on crime,” “the war on drugs,” “the war on terror” add to this perception, as do articles quoting police calling many urban areas combat or war zones. It is essential we make every effort to promote the positive collaboration and interaction with community leaders and residents to promote our message of providing a safe environment through police-citizen partnership with an emphasis on mutual trust, integrity, fairness, and professionalism.------------[1] Federal Bureau of Investigation, Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report (Washington, DC: Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011).[2] BJA FY 13 Bryne Criminal Justice Innovation Program: Application,” City of Springfield Massachusetts, Springfield, MA, 2013 [submitted to Bureau of Justice Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice], https://privacysos.org/sites/all/files/byrne_c3_2.pdf[3] Department of the Army, Counterinsurgency (FM 3-24), (Washington, DC: Department of the Army, 2006), http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/Repository/Materials/COIN-FM3-24.pdf, 23.[4] “BJA FY 13 Bryne Criminal Justice Innovation Program: Application,” 15.[5] Timothy Alben, “The ‘Militarization’ of Police: Another Perspective,” Boston Herald, October 25, 2014.[6] Ibid.[7] Mike Few, “Lies, Damn Lies, and Metrics in Small Wars,” Small Wars Journal, April 15, 2011, SJW Blog, http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/lies-damn-lies-and-metrics-in-small-wars[8] Ibid.

AB  -  This qualitative research is to explain the characteristics of the inmate subculture, the structures of inmate group and the sub-structural model of inmates afflicting the Thai prison administration. In- depth interviews are conducted with the inmate group chiefs (called "leader") and with the authorities of five Central Prisons in Thailand empowered to control inmates sentenced to terms of more than 30 years. Results reveal that most inmates were intentionally grouped by the areas where they lived before being convicted. The "Prison Group" was thus called "Home" to show the geographic inmate origin, such as the Bangkhen Home, the Chonburi Home and the Bangkwang Home and so on. Such grouping was intended to provide familiarity and sharing among member and to prevent maltreatment from other inmates. This grouping plan in general, caused no cultural clashes with prison regulations, but three resulting subcultures plagued the prison administration. They were 1) the young adult inmate grouping with offense records as juveniles, 2) the body and facial tattoo grouping, and 3) the trafficker grouping. The traffickers developed financial influence and cooperation between Home groups, and exploited opportunities in mobile phone smuggling, contraband trafficking, gambling and blackmail, and other prohibited activities. They sought to earn income in order to supervise members and to create negotiation power with other Homes and the authorities in order to ease their prison lives.

AB  - The sexual victimization of sexual minorities enrolled in college is not a topic that has been well researched. The present study examines the awareness that college minority students have of services they can access in the event they experience sexual violence. The results indicate that many students are unaware of specific services that they can access if they are sexually victimized. Disclosing an incident of sexual violence, or being the recipient of a disclosure of sexual violence, is related to knowledge of aftercare services. Non-White students demonstrate less awareness of services than White students, indicating that these students may not receive aftercare in the event of sexual victimization because they do not have the knowledge of which services are available. Several policy recommendations and directions for future research stem from these findings.

AB  - This study examines the impact of criminal mobility on criminal earning patterns in a sample of incarcerated offenders who reported their criminal experiences over a three-year period. Criminal mobility is indicated by an individual's offending perimeter and not the traditional journey-to-crime measure. Findings reveal that the offending perimeter length is a factor of criminal achievement in that mobile offenders reported higher financial earnings from crime than immobile offenders. Greater distances traveled for crime were also generally associated with higher criminal earnings, but this was more salient for predatory offenders than market offenders.

AB  - 2014 may have marked a turning point in mobile device evidence collection. Technical landmarks made mobile device evidence more accessible from a great many devices, while legal landmarks - notably Riley v. California (573 U.S. _ [2014]), decided in June by the US Supreme Court - appeared to make it less accessible. (Worth noting: the Canadian Supreme Court went the other way. In early December, it ruled that police did not need warrants for cell phone searches incident to arrest.)Don't give a defense attorney the ability to question whether you planted or deleted data. As soon as the subject signs the consent form and hands over the device, isolate it from the network, either by placing it in Airplane Mode or by the use of a Faraday container of some kind. Then, have a way to perform a forensic extraction from the device.Remember, as discussed in July, the contacts (both saved and unsaved), locations, calendar entries, and messages within a mobile device -- on their own, or as part of a pattern -- can help spur a victim's memories and enable you, using what the Force Science Institute calls "cognitive interviewing," to help them reconstruct a timeline of events leading up to trauma they experienced.In addition, many labs are backlogged. If you can no longer afford to wait on someone else's timetable for evidence, you should be tracking a wide range of metrics to show how and why to support mobile forensic examinations. This is true whether you're a patrol officer, investigator/detective, or forensic examiner: your supervisors have a lot competing for their attention, so make issues with mobile device evidence worth their while.

AB  - Although evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities, transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies, emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting.

AB  - Residential mobility is one documented stressor contributing to higher delinquency and worse educational outcomes. Sensitive period life course models suggest that certain developmental stages make individuals more susceptible to the effects of an exposure, like residential mobility, on outcomes. However, most prior research is observational, and has not examined heterogeneity across age or gender that may inform sensitive periods, even though it may have important implications for the etiology of adolescent development. Moreover, there are important translational implications for identifying the groups most vulnerable to residential mobility to inform how to buffer adverse effects of moving. In this study, low-income families were randomized to residential mobility out of public housing into lower poverty neighborhoods using a rental subsidy voucher (“experimental voucher condition”), and were compared to control families remaining in public housing. The sample was comprised of 2829 youth (51% female; 62% Non-Hispanic Black, 31% Hispanic, 7% other race). At baseline, youth ranged from 5 to 16 years old. This study hypothesized that random assignment to the housing voucher condition would generate harmful effects on delinquency and educational problems, compared to the control group, among boys who were older at baseline. The results confirmed this hypothesis: random assignment to the experimental voucher condition generating residential mobility caused higher delinquency among boys who were 13–16 years old at baseline, compared to same-age, in-place public housing controls. However, residential mobility did not affect delinquency among girls regardless of age, or among boys who were 5–12 years old at baseline. The pattern of results for educational problems was similar but weaker. Families with teenage boys are particularly vulnerable to residential transitions. Incorporating additional supports into housing programs may help low-income, urban families to successfully transition to lower poverty neighborhoods.

AB  - This study—based on a national data set (N = 1,447)—focuses on extrafamilial sexual assaults and their mobility. Spatial information about the offender’s house, the victim’s house, and the crime scene was combined in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the assaults fall in the categories of total mobility (42.78%) and offender mobility (33.10%). Our results also show the validity of the distance decay function with over 50% of aggressions occurring within 3 km of the offender’s house. The analysis did not reveal the existence of buffer zones, probably due to the acquaintance between some of the offenders and their victims. The evidence suggests that environmental risk factors are more significant than individual ones when it comes to explaining the variation among mobility patterns in sexual assaults. Offenders appear to adapt their mobility patterns and modus operandi according to the environmental constraints. Often, offenders choose their own or their victim’s house as a safe environment for performed sexual assault.

AB  - According to routine activities theory, crime is the result of an intersection between victims and offenders in both time and space. We introduce a spatial typology that identifies five combinations of victim and offender mobility to homicide incident locations: internal, predatory, intrusion, offense mobility, and total mobility types. The authors' argue that the joint mobility pattern of the victim and offender is the mechanism underlying routine activities theory, and made explicit by the spatial typology. Using information on the 420 homicides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between 1987 and 1995, we demonstrate that the majority of homicides involve at least some mobility on the part of victims and/or offenders. Our results also indicate that mobility to homicide incident locations is most associated with event characteristics such as motive, rather than with characteristics of the participants. With most offenders committing the homicide outside of their own neighborhood, levels of lethal violence in a community are influenced more by the interaction among nonlocal participants than by the violent actions of local residents.

AB  - This article asks how terrorism expertise has been mobilized in recent trials on terrorism financing. How is expert knowledge concerning ongoing and complex political situations involving alleged terrorism translated into factual evidence before a court of law? What kind of sources do courts use in terrorism cases, and what kind of expert knowledge is acknowledged or ignored? Through analysis of concrete cases under the United Kingdom (UK) Terrorism Act (2000) and the Dutch penal law Article 421Sr, we show how contested terrorism expertise becomes ‘certified knowledge’ that holds together as grounds for conviction before a court of law. This article contributes to socio‐legal debates on legal knowledge in two ways. First, we analyse the everyday, material practices of gathering, presenting, and contesting expertise in relation to security. Second, the article analyses new case material and a particular kind of knowledge – namely, security knowledge and terrorism expertise – to identify patterns in what is deemed relevant for the court.

AB  - Mexican human rights organizations accuse the Mexican military and federal police of having taken part in tens of thousands of forced disappearances in the last decade. Curiously, the regions in which people disappear are also sites of displacement and changing patterns of land tenure and production. Yet, property relations are seldom a topic of studies on illegal state activities. Through a state theory lens, including Aníbal Quijano's notion of coloniality of power, this article examines conflicts between private property and communal land tenure such as ejidos in Mexico, as two different property regimes. The article aims to show how the state ensemble not only removes legal protection for communal tenure but also mobilizes legal as well as illegal means to force the change of communal lands into private property. Beyond that, the article also aims to show how these changes in land tenure regulation intersect with the Mexican War on Drugs.

AB  - Based on an examination of the earnings records of ex-offenders released from Virginia correctional institutions from fiscal year 1999 to 2003, this article provides an industrial profile testing the presumption that most ex-offenders are only able to find employment in low-level occupations, with low rates of job retention, and limited customer contact Data related to both ex-offenders and their respective employers were categorized using the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and as a result, overall employment, full-time employment, and earnings patterns were identified for each industry. When available, data regarding the entire workforce were used for comparison purposes. The information provided in this article could be used by transition coordinators in job placement activities. Furthermore, correctional education administrators could use this information for the following purposes: 1) allocating resources to the vocational areas where ex-offenders are more likely to find employment, 2) cultivating relationships with employers most likely to hire exoffenders, and 3) influencing major employers who do not have histories of hiring exoffenders to change their human resource practices.

AB  - This paper proposes a machine learning application to identify mobile phone users suspected of involvement in criminal activities. The application characterizes the behavioral patterns of suspect users versus non-suspect users based on usage metadata such as call duration, call distribution, interaction time preferences and text-to-call ratios while avoiding any access to the content of calls or messages. The application is based on targeted Bayesian network learning method. It generates a graphical network that can be used by domain experts to gain intuitive insights about the key features that can help identify suspect users. The method enables experts to manage the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy using information theory metrics. Unlike other graphical Bayesian classifiers, the proposed application accomplishes the task required of a security company, namely an accurate suspect identification rate (recall) of at least 50% with no more than a 1% false identification rate. The targeted Bayesian network learning method is also used for additional tasks such as anomaly detection, distinction between “relevant” and “irrelevant” anomalies, and for associating anonymous telephone numbers with existing users by matching behavioral patterns.

AB  - The coupling of racial and economic stratification has been found to result in a range of adverse outcomes for youth of color, including disproportionate exposure to violence and victimization. Primary explanations of these patterns, particularly at the micro-level, have focused on the impact of street culture. In this article, we draw from a multiyear ethnography in Cape Town, South Africa, to offer a theoretical elaboration of the place of culture in contributing to victimization risks among urban minority young men. The study is based on data collected from a sample of 26 young men of color who lived on the Cape Flats between 2003 and 2006. Using grounded theory methods, we suggest the import of unequal access to spatial mobility as a multifaceted means by which culture mediates young men's risks for victimization in disadvantaged communities. We find that transitory mobility -- conceptualized as youth's temporary access to cultural spaces outside their segregated residential neighborhoods -- is an important source of cultural heterogeneity in townships that can intensify the strength of local social identities and outgroup antipathies directed at those whose mobility is perceived as a cultural threat. Transitorily mobile young men's cultural repertoires are a key facet of street efficacy that can either insulate them from risk or heighten their vulnerabilities. Our findings are suggestive of important sources of variation in young men's victimization outcomes in disadvantaged communities, offering insights about factors that shape risks beyond those linked to the victim-offender overlap in high-risk settings.

AB  - In this paper, we use police recorded crime data and purchase price information to investigate patterns in property stolen during domestic burglaries. We test the hypotheses that frequently stolen items are 'CRAVED' (Clarke 1999) and that the levels at which items are stolen vary over time, according to a product's position in the consumer goods life cycle of innovation, growth, mass market, saturation (Felson and Clarke 1998). We focus on audio-visual equipment and mobile telephones, comparing the trends with those for cash. The results show that the prevalence of theft of the products considered has changed significantly over the period studied, consistent with the life cycle hypothesis. The crime prevention implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for further research considered.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Objectives Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us? Methods This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets. Results There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably. Conclusions The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates criminal nomadism-an individual's propensity to engage in continuous or intermittent interurban travel as a way to cope with the consequences of their criminal lifestyle and/or as a strategy to adapt to the reality of being a "career criminal." Methods The criminal-career itinerary across Canada of 448 men convicted of sex offenses was reconstructed through individual interviews and analysis of detailed criminal records. Five distinct components of criminal nomadism (i.e., trips, nodes, paths, range, and mesolevel activity space), inspired by crime pattern theory, are suggested and analyzed. Results Results show that criminal nomadism is the reality of young and educated Whites who have a prolific criminal career interspersed with long incarceration sentences. Nomadic offenders did not wander freely and randomly, but rather seemed to be looking for opportunities and privacy. Sex-offending variables did not make a significant contribution to predictions, suggesting that criminal nomadism is more a general offending phenomenon than something specific to sex offending. Conclusions This study provides supporting evidence that an extensive criminal career is generally associated with a geographically scattered and nomadic lifestyle. Implications for public policies and future studies are discussed.

AB  - Rural, urban, and suburban areas vary widely in patterns of criminal behavior.  The assertion that crime and place vary and are interrelated is now known as the ecological approach.  Researchers have shown that land use patterns cause population shifts, which can then produce a change in the criminal activity of the area.  Recent studies have shown that crime and residential and commercial activity are definitely related and that crime is related to changes in the spatial mobility of criminals.  Crime is also related to population characteristics, physical environmental factors, and mobility patterns.  Studies based on the National Crime Survey of victims show that the extent of urbanism, housing density, and poverty are significant predictors of violent and property crime.  However, crime in the suburbs is now a relevant concern for crime control agencies.  A general crime risk assessment places all sites into a common context - the US average - and makes it possible to perform rational, objective comparisons of crime potentials in larger, multisite operations.

AB  - Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group and exhibit various offense patterns. Often the location where the offender committed the offense is different from where the offender encountered their victim. Applying crime pattern theory, this study sought to understand if the type of location, victim, and situational characteristics could predict whether an offender would commit the sexual offense in a different and more secluded location than where he first encountered the victim. Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  -  Crime rates seem to be severely augmenting over the past several years in Pakistan which has perpetuated concerns as to what, when and how this upsurge will be eradicated. State institutions are supposed to be in utmost perplexity, given the enormity of worsening law and order situation, compelling government on the flip side to expend more resources in strengthening institutions to confront crime, whereas, the economy has been confronted with massive energy crisis, mass unemployment and considerable inflation which has rendered most of the people into articulate apprehension as to how to satisfy basic necessities. A framework to investigate the variability in the rising street crimes, as affected by social and institutional outcomes, has been established using a cross sectional study. Questionnaire, entailing seven sections incorporating numerous patterns of behavior and history of involvement in different crimes for potential street criminals was observed as data collection instrument. In order to specifically explicate the intent of street crimes on micro level, various motivational and de-motivational factors that stimulate people to resort to street crimes were scrutinized. Intent of mobile snatching and intent of street assault as potential dependent variables were examined using numerous variables that influence the occurrence and intent of these crimes using ordered probit along with ordered logit and tobit as competing models. Model Estimates asserts that intent of mobile snatching has been significantly enhanced owing to perceived judicial inefficiency and lower ability of police reforms to operate effectively, which signifies the inefficiency of institutions that are entitled to deliver justice and maintaining law and order respectively. Whereas, intent of street assaults, as an outcome, affirms that people with lack of self-stability and severe childhood punishments were more tempted to be involved in violent acts.

AB  - Research on offender mobility is directed to three main elements: distance, anchor points, and direction. Previous research in geographical criminology has revealed that: (1) the journey to crime is limited in distance and follows a distance decay pattern; (2) the home of the offender plays a central role as the starting point of crime trips; and (3) the direction of the trip is influenced by the opportunities to commit crimes. The findings are more or less accepted as 'laws' in the field. However, research on offender mobility is often limited by its method, data and sample of arrested offenders. This study, in contrast, investigated a sample of arrested foreign offenders (East Europeans) who were staying temporarily in Belgium. They lack the space awareness and routine activities of residential offenders. Using multiple methods and data, including police statistics, case file analysis and offender interviews, we investigated the travelling patterns of these offenders both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings demonstrate that: (1) the degree of distance decay is much more moderate than generally found in the literature; (2) the official living address plays hardly any role at all as an anchor point; and (3) these offenders travel away from opportunity structures, which is different from the routine activity patterns of Belgian offenders. Overall, our findings indicate that offender mobility does not fit the accepted general pattern or 'laws' as assumed in previous research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - With the appearance of the Internet, open to everyone in 1991, criminals saw a big opportunity in moving their organisations to the World Wide Web, taking advantage of these infrastructures as it allowed higher mobility and scalability. Later on, in the year 2000, the first system appeared, creating what is known today as the Dark Web. This layer of the World Wide Web became quickly the option to go when criminals wanted to sell and deliver content such as match-fixing, children pornography, drugs market, guns market, etc. This obscure side of the Dark Web, makes it a relevant topic to study in order to tackle this huge network and help to identify these malicious activities and actors.In this master thesis, it is shown through the study of two datasets from the Dark Web, that we are surrounded by capable technologies that can be applied to these types of problems in order to increase our knowledge about the data and reveal interesting characteristics in an interactive and useful way. One dataset has 10 000 relations from domains living in the Dark Web, and the other dataset has thousands of data from just 11 specific domains from the Dark Web.We reveal detailed information about each dataset by applying di↵erent analysis and data mining algorithms. For the first dataset we studied domains availability patterns with temporal analysis, we categorised domains with machine learning neural networks and we reveal the network topology and nodes relevance with social networks analysis and core-periphery model. Regarding the second dataset, we created a cross matching information web graph and applied a name entity recognition algorithm which ended in a tool for identifying entities within dark web’s domains. All of these approaches culminated in an interactive web application where we publicly not only display the entire research but also the tools developed along with the project (https://darkor.org).

AB  - This article examines the settings for frauds in the context of crime networks, fraud opportunities and of a victim-centric typology of fraud. It demonstrates the variety of actors, settings and the variable need for knowing collaboration between co-offenders in frauds of different types. It explores what is known about those involved in the organization of some forms of frauds; how they find both co-offenders and victims in face-to-face and remote settings; and the barriers to growth of the `fraud business'. It concludes that the globalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between settings, with their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns of business, consumer and investment activities), the variable abilities of would-be perpetrators to recognize and act on those opportunities (the `crime scripts' perspective), and their interactions with controls (including, but not restricted to, law enforcement). Constructs of `organized crime' are becoming less obsessed with the structure of groups than with what people need from the largely illicit and largely licit worlds before they commit fraud. Although some frauds are committed by generic transnational `organized crime' networks, others are merely mobile small groups or individuals who can transplant techniques wherever they go; and others still commit very large one-off frauds without a need for long-term or any involvement in `organized crime'.

AB  -  It is well known that, due to that inherent differences in their underlying causal mechanisms, different types of crime will have variable impacts on different groups of people. Furthermore, the locations of vulnerable groups of people are highly temporally dynamic. Hence an accurate estimate of the true population at risk in a given place and time is vital for reliable crime rate calculation and hotspot generation. However, the choice of denominator is fraught with difficulty because data describing popular movements, rather than simply residential location, are limited. This research will make use of new 'crowd-sourced' data in an attempt to create more accurate estimates of the population at risk for mobile crimes such as street robbery. Importantly, these data are both spatially and temporally referenced and can therefore be used to estimate crime rate significance in both space and time. Spatio-temporal cluster hunting techniques will be used to identify crime hotspots that are significant given the size of the ambient population in the area at the time.

AB  - In this dissertation I investigate the persistence of institutional weakness and examine the conditions under which change becomes possible. Such questions are of particular importance in Latin America, where a democratic period marked by high rates of crime and violence in many countries has laid bare the precariousness of state institutions.What we've observed throughout Latin America and elsewhere, is that conditions facing police institutions, such as extensive corruption, violence, and incompetence in fighting crime, may exhibit a remarkable continuity over time, even when they are widely recognized as a problem. Why does institutional weakness persist for such extended periods of time, particularly on an issue that is so politically salient? Under what conditions do political leaders undertake institutional reform?Drawing on evidence from periods of reform and "non-reform" in Colombia, Buenos Aires Province, and São Paulo State, I demonstrate that the root of institutional continuity and change can be found in societal contestation over the distribution of protection and repression, which inhibits the formation of a coherent demand for reform. Such fragmentation facilitates what I call patterns of accommodation among political leaders and police institutions, wherein politicians grant police broad autonomy in exchange for the cooperation of the manager of the state's coercive authority in advancing their political objectives. Reform becomes possible following the onset of a mobilized scandal, a high-profile act of police deviance that reveals shared preferences across a range of societal sectors that is then utilized by a robust political opposition that can maintain the event on the agenda as a platform for attacking the incumbent. Facing a clear societal demand and an electoral threat, politicians become more likely to enact reform following such a mobilized scandal.  Furthermore, given the role often played by societal fragmentation in impeding reform, I investigate the conditions under which politicians choose to build state capacity through the incorporation of societal actors. I argue that reform is likely to include "participatory security" in contexts of poor police-society relations or low police capacity and resources, with different values along these dimensions leading to important differences in institutional design.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test whether there is a relationship between situational and modus operandi characteristics and criminal mobility during the sexual assault event. Data collected from both police files and semistructured interviews with 72 serial sex offenders who have committed 361 sexual assaults have been used. Negative binomial regression was used to identify the relationships between the situational and modus operandi characteristics and the criminal mobility exhibited during the sexual assault. Events that involved child or adolescent victims, those where the offender did not use pornography prior to crime, and those where victim resistance was observed exhibited more criminal mobility. Moreover, crimes in which the victim was selected, the victim was alone when approached by the offender, and the assault was characterized by sexual penetration and a lack of premeditation exhibited more criminal mobility. Results seem to suggest that criminal mobility is a goal-oriented action taken by serial sex offenders to successfully complete their crime and to avoid detection and apprehension.

AB  - Push Notification Services. One of the best examples of these high-performance security processes is the smartphone in your pocket or handbag. Push Notification Services (PNS), a highly efficient and secure remote notification feature for Android, iOS and Microsoft smartphone devices establishes an encrypted IP connection with the PNS and receives notifications over this connection. If a notification for an app arrives when that app is not running, the device alerts the user that the app has data waiting for it. When new data for an app arrives, the provider prepares and sends a notification to the PNS, which pushes the notification to the target device. This process also works with other IoT devices, sensors and even IP cameras.The PNS establishes peer-to-peer authentication in the IoT sensor identity Transport Layer Security (TLS). The IoT device initiates a TLS connection with the PNS, which returns a digital certificate from the server. The device validates this certificate and then sends its device certificate to the PNS, which validates that certificate. PNS servers also have the necessary certificates, credential authority certificates, and cryptographic keys (both private and public) for validating connections and the identities of providers, corporate servers and IoT devices. This provides a more secure alternative to SSL, especially considering the latest PCI-DSS 3.1 compliance requirementsOur petroleum example is another case in point. If caught in time, the IoT sensor network responsible for detecting leaking pipes would have notified plant operators in real time to implement a repair. Should a petroleum refinery flow sensor or server come under attack, the usage archives or historical data could be compromised. A cyber-attack on a refinery during peak winter (heating) or summer (automobile usage) periods could be catastrophic. Protecting IoT sensor data in motion is important, but intelligence in the wrong hands can be deadly. This is what cyber resilience is all about: not only protecting the operation and transmission of data, but preserving "data at rest."IoT data may statically reside internally, immediately nearby or in mobile objects and IoT data concentration storage points. The data may be distributed widely, but it always must be transmitted and stored securely. The migration or "flow" of IoT data can continue from one secure container to another, until a centralized data store is reached where more sophisticated processing and analysis takes place, like facial recognition or other pattern matching algorithm.

AB  - This Article considers the Fourth Amendment implications of a study on a passive monitoring system where employees shared data from wearables, phone applications, and position beacons that provided private information such as weekend phone use, sleep patterns in the bedroom, and emotional states. The study's authors hope to use the data collected to create a new system for objectively assessing employee performance that will replace the current system which is plagued by the inherent bias of self-reporting and peerreview and which is labor intensive and inefficient. The researchers were able to successfully link the data collected with the quality of worker performance. This technological advance raises the prospect of law enforcement gaining access to sensitive information from employers for use in criminal investigations. This Article analyzes the Fourth Amendment issues raised by police access to this new technology. Although the Supreme Court currently finds government collection of a comprehensive chronicle of a person's life to constitute a Fourth Amendment search, widespread employee acceptance of mobile sensing could undermine any claim in having a reasonable expectation of privacy in such information. Additionally, employee tolerance of passive monitoring could make employer data available to the government through third party consent. When previously assessing employees' privacy, the Court demonstrated a willingness to accept the needs of the employer and society as justification for limiting workers' Fourth Amendment rights. Ultimately, then, Court precedent suggests that passive monitoring could erode Fourth Amendment rights in the long term.

AB  - | The criminal mobility of outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) members presents a significant challenge to Australian governments and police. Examining patterns of mobility can help to better understand the opportunity structures that underpin offending by OMCGs and to drive national collaborative responses to these gangs. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of criminal mobility in a sample of almost 4,000 OMCG members in more than 400 chapters. Around one in 10 members showed evidence of criminal mobility over the long term, while more than one-third of chapters comprised criminally mobile members. Criminally mobile gang members were heavily concentrated in a small number of chapters. Patterns of criminal mobility primarily involve movements into east coast jurisdictions. New South Wales and Queensland emerged as the most common destinations for criminally mobile OMCG members.

AB  - We assessed the impact of planned aggression across homicide mobility types in Newark, New Jersey, from 1997 through 2007. Homicides where offenders traveled to victims' resident/incident locales were more likely to involve aggressive intent, whereas homicides where victims traversed to offender/incident locales were less likely to involve planned aggression. Planned aggression was unrelated to geographically proximate (internal) homicides as well as geographically distinct (total mobility) homicides. Study findings show that routine activities and situational characteristics are not only important in explaining homicide patterns but also demonstrate that planned aggression meaningfully contributes to the routine activities and environmental criminology frameworks under specific geographic conditions.

AB  - Based on mobile phone data from the city of Barcelona, Spain, generalized linear models are used to analyse the relationship between urban mobilities and the spatial and temporal patterning of robbery and theft. The hypothesis was made that mobility fluxes may undermine social control mechanisms by altering the socio-demographic composition of urban populations, therefore increasing the risk of crime victimization. The analysis brought together indicators of land use and a measure of the ambient population disaggregated by different profiles of public space users (by sex, age, and place of residence). The results indicate that robbery and theft tend to cluster around locations that attract a higher proportion of non-residents (i.e. national and international visitors). Non-local visitors, who visit the city occasionally or once in a lifetime, lack a comprehensive knowledge of the environment which would help them to navigate safely through the urban space. Therefore, their presence not only unsettles the social routines of public spaces in Barcelona but also reflects negatively in terms of crime occurrence. This finding raises questions about how to accommodate growing mobilities in our cities without detriment to incumbent residents and their safety, which seems to be critical in post-COVID-19 urban planning.

AB  - This article focuses on the close association between inequality and punishment observed over recent decades at a macro level, at least in some regions of the world. A review of the empirical literature first provides an overview of the different types of variables mobilized to try to understand this complex relationship. The aim of the empirical part is to explore the potential role of attitudes towards inequality in this relationship, on the basis of country-level data available for West European countries. The results do not support the idea that a more meritocratic ethos at the country level would create the connection between inequality and punishment. On the contrary, they suggest the persistence of a systemic link independently of attitudinal variables. However, by showing that, the greater the inequality, the more the population calls for redistributive intervention by the state, and the more it also calls for punitive intervention, the findings could suggest another pattern. This moves away from a rather deterministic perspective to highlight the room for manoeuvre for social change.

AB  - The study of geographic mobility through geospatial analysis and journey-to-crime approaches has made progress in environmental criminology, finding most offenders commit crime close to their residence. However, extant literature on serial homicide and geographic mobility is scarce, specifically lacking a comprehensive appraisal of relative research. To gain a better understanding of the geographic mobility patterns of serial homicide offenders, we must determine the current status of literature in this area, to figure out where to go in terms of future research. Therefore, the following study is a scoping review of existing literature on geographic mobility and serial homicide and four associated typologies (Holmes & DeBurger’s Geographic typology, Hickey’s Mobility typology, Canter’s Circle typology, and Rossmo’s Hunting Style typology) to achieve the following: (1) Comprehensively evaluate literature regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and four associated typologies to establish the current status of research; (2) uncover potential literature gaps; and (3) provide future research recommendations. Literature sources (N = 43) on serial homicide and geographic mobility (1985–2018) were examined. While findings recognize the relevance of mobility functions in serial homicide investigations, gaps in literature were evident regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and the four associated typologies. Findings also reveal that systematic research in this field is limited. Policy implications and future research recommendations are discussed.

AB  - In early 2001, Australia experienced a sudden, significant reduction in the availability of heroin, following a number of years of unprecedented availability of high-grade heroin. This study examines changes in the scale, method, structure and visibility of heroin and other drug distribution in New South Wales (NSW), and in the incidence of possession and use of heroin and other drugs associated with this reduction in heroin availability. Police incident data on possession/use of illicit drugs and on incidents of acquisitive crime were analysed using time-series analysis. Key informants (n=71) from NSW law enforcement and health agencies and heroin users (n=53) were interviewed regarding changes in the drug market following the reduced availability of heroin. NSW police reports were accessed for information on police investigations into drug crime and related activities. Drug distribution in NSW appeared to change around the time of the heroin shortage. High-level distribution of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine may have remained somewhat discretely managed by different organized crime groups but greater collaboration occurred between these groups. Among mid-level distributors, there appeared to be a shift in emphasis from heroin to other drug distribution. Low-level dealers may have made a short-term shift from heroin to cocaine distribution. Low-level drug dealing also appeared to shift towards mobile and less overt methods of dealing. The number of street-level dealers reduced and in the longer-term, visibility of the drug markets decreased. There were significant decreases in police incidents of heroin possession/use reported by police, which were more marked among males and younger persons. At the same time, increases were observed in incidents for cocaine possession/use. There was a sustained decrease in theft offences but a temporary increase in robbery offences during the peak period of reduced availability. This appeared to represent a shift in the criminal behaviour of users remaining in the market and was associated with changes in drug-use patterns. Although the motivation behind the offending behaviour remained the same over time, cocaine use was associated with more violent crime. The method and structure of illicit drug distribution changed along with reduced heroin supply and carried implications for the policing of drug markets. Australia does not have a large cocaine market and the findings may have differed in countries where cocaine is in more ready supply. [publication abstract]

AB  - America’s growing prison population has led to an increasing number of released offenders. The high rates of offenders returning to prison after their release, whether through revocation of parole or new criminal behavior, have renewed interest in explanations of recidivism. While researchers have focused on individual level crime theory and characteristics to explain recidivism, one neglected area of study is neighborhood context’s role in recidivism. This is odd because much recent research has endeavored to establish the link between context and crime. The experiences of recently released offenders offer ample evidence that neighborhood context would logically influence recidivism, or the return to criminality, in much the same way as for other criminality, if not more. The few examples of research that attempts to address this gap also fail to incorporate the fact that recently released offenders are likely a highly mobile population, something that could cause error in contextual analysis. This dissertation attempts to add to the knowledge of contextual effects on recidivism while improving on previously used methods. Using a unique dataset of released offenders in Ohio that contains serial residence and violation information, this project tests a social disorganization model of recidivism, while also analyzing mobility patterns. A third analysis uses a unique property of the dataset: the fact that it includes prisoners sentenced under indeterminate and determinate sentencing guidelines. This offers the chance to assess the deterrent aspects of the switch in sentencing as well as how deterrence interacts within neighborhood context. The first analysis of residential mobility patterns answers four questions: do recently released offenders move, where do recently released offenders move, who lives where initially, and who moves? The results indicate that offenders do move and move at a higher rate than the general public, with most offenders in the study experiencing at least one move in the first year after release. These movements are mostly lateral, or to neighborhoods that are similar to the neighborhoods offenders reside in immediately after release. Neighborhood of initial residence is related most notably to race and whether an offender is released into a halfway house. Finally, movement is related to employment, race, and living in a halfway house. The second analysis of contextual effects on recidivism, using discrete time multilevel logistic regression models to predict likelihood of a parole violation and arrest, reveals support for social disorganization theory. The results show neighborhood economic disadvantage and residential stability are related to individual offender’s likelihood of recidivism. Individual characteristics, like demographic characteristics, prior offending history, employment and a time variant measure of residential mobility are also related to recidivism. The third analysis uses a quasi-experimental method to test deterrence between parolees and PRC offenders. After propensity score matching a sample of both groups, the results reveal little evidence of a deterrent effect of length of potential punishment on recidivism beyond a consistent parolee/PRC effect. Interestingly, contextual measures only mattered for parolees, indicating that deterrence and context may interact. The results from this set of analyses indicate three major findings. First, while prisoners move, that movement is mostly lateral, meaning that contextual research that has not taken movement into account is likely unbiased. Second, neighborhood context does matter for recently released offenders, as offenders in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods and less residentially stable neighborhoods are more likely to recidivate. Third, recently released offenders showed little evidence of being deterred, although there was some evidence that parolees in disorganized neighborhoods were more likely to recidivate than parolees in better neighborhoods, indicating a potential undermining of deterrence in disorganized neighborhoods.

AB  - Abstract This study was designed to identify how likely will parents or caregivers use a GPS device (Global Positioning System) for prepubescent children for safety purposes. This original research could be a step closer to child safety and prevention from children going missing. Studies show that the first three hours are the most critical when trying to locate a missing child, and death most likely occurs in the first three hours of the abduction. Previous research on GPS tracking devices for children emerged into trust issues, device performances, child's location-time pattern, the evolution of technology used from an infant to the prepubescent, or understanding children's everyday mobility. No research has been done in U.S. on parental view on GPS devices for child protection when they travel or spend time unescorted. This study analyzed 101 surveys completed by parents or caregivers of children age 6 to 11 years old. As an instrument of measurement, the researcher used a survey addressed to parents of school children 6 to 11 years old, which was distributed through the Survey Monkey Audience website. The majority of the participants in this study is not using a device for child safety (81%). In contrast with the results of the study conducted in the UK (Vasalou, Oostveen, and Joinson, 2012), where parents willing to use these technologies with their children were a minority, whereas in U.S., parents or caregivers willing to use GPS devices for child safety were not a minority (83%). About 50% of the total respondents reported that it is very or somewhat likely to use a monitoring device for child safety. Still, there is a lack of parental knowledge about the GPS devices designed for child safety (33% are familiar with these devices). This study could be a contribution to the body of knowledge working to protect children. Could be a reference for parents to better understand the functionality of these devices, and for tracking device manufacturers to acknowledge and adapt the products to consumer's necessity. This study could be used as a reference for other researchers that are going to complete work in this area of study. Key words: GPS, child safety, tracking devices, parental view, child abduction, missing children, peace of mind, prepubescent.

AB  - Background:Most cannabis patients engage with dispensary staff, like budtenders, for medical advice on cannabis. Yet, little is known about these interactions and how the characteristics of budtenders affect these interactions. This study investigated demographics, workplace characteristics, medical decision-making, and online behaviors among a sample of budtenders.Methods:Between June and September 2016, a cross-sectional Internet survey was administered to budtenders in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. A total of 158 budtenders fully responded to the survey. A series of comparisons were conducted to determine differences between trained and untrained budtenders.Results:Among the 158 budtenders, 56% had received formal training to become a budtender. Several demographic differences were found between trained and untrained budtenders. For workplace characteristics, trained budtenders were more likely to report budtender as their primary job (74% vs 53%), practice more than 5 years (34% vs 11%), and receive sales commission (57% vs 16%). Trained budtenders were significantly less likely to perceive medical decision-making as very important (47% vs 68%) and have a patient-centered philosophy (77% vs 89%). Although trained budtenders had significantly lower Internet usage, they were significantly more likely to exchange information with patients through e-mail (58% vs 39%), text message (46% vs 30%), mobile app (33% vs 11%), video call (26% vs 3%), and social media (51% vs 23%).Conclusions:Budtenders who are formally trained exhibit significantly different patterns of interaction with medical cannabis patients. Future studies will use multivariate methods to better determine which factors independently influence interactions and how budtenders operate after the introduction of regulations under the newly passed Proposition 64 that permits recreational cannabis use in California.

AB  - It has been contended that the hyper-criminalisation of immigrants and especially non-European Union (non-EU) immigrants explains the increased presence of foreign nationals in European prisons. A more nuanced explanation for the changed composition of European prison populations is offered by this article. Structural factors may result in immigrants having a greater risk of criminalisation than has the native population, but the presence of foreign nationals in European prisons must also be understood as a product of changes in patterns of criminal activity and increased mobility. The article uses the case of the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to probe the reasons behind the reported presence of foreign nationals in European prisons. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  -  Community notification laws have been passed by the federal government and legislature of every state. At the very least, these laws require local law enforcement officials to publicize the personal and residential information of known sex offenders. Although researchers and other social commentators have begun to assess the effects of community notification on targeted sex offenders and on criminal justice practices and practitioners, the potential consequences of the policy for different types of communities have received only scant attention. Using sex offender registry and US Census data for two states (Nebraska and Oklahoma), we examine the relationship between community characteristics and the residential patterns of sex offenders. Findings from mapping and regression analyses suggest a greater concentration of sex offenders in disadvantaged communities than in more affluent communities. To the extent that community notification allows residents of more affluent communities to mobilize resources in order to remove identified sex offenders, it may increase the geographical clustering of these offenders in areas already facing a greater risk and having fewer resources to manage the problem. Implications of findings in terms of "concentrated disadvantage" are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Background For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geographical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention. Objective The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns. Participants This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013. Methods By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern. Results Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces. Conclusions Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior.

AB  - Many localities in regional Australia are undergoing economic transformation. In many places, agriculture and mining, together with their related service and processing industries, are being displaced as the dominant economic activity by manufacturing, tourism and recreation, and retirement industries. Economic change affects local communities. Population mobility due to changes in employment disrupts the social structure of localities. This affects the nature and intensity of social interactions among locals, and it influences a community's ability to develop efficient mechanisms of social control. This has a direct impact on local crime rates. This paper, the third in a series devoted to the study of crime in regional Australia (see Carcach 2000a, 2000b), explores further the effect that interactions between size, location, economic transformation and social attributes have on local crime rates. Using data for Local Government Areas in the mainland eastern states, this study shows that: * Crime rates are lower in localities that are both residentially and socially stable. * Though associated with low local crime rates, factors such as low residential mobility, high average educational level, low income inequality and low unemployment operate differently depending on the population size of local areas and their geographic position relative to major service centres. * Crime rates in small and medium-sized towns that are proximate to a major service centre are highly sensitive to changes in economic and social conditions. This suggests the possibility of crime being diffused from major urban centres to minor surrounding towns. This study reinforces the need for localised crime control and prevention initiatives and, more importantly, highlights the need for understanding how the crime patterns of local areas relate to each other.

AB  - The nascent field of digital forensics is heavily influenced by practice. Much digital forensics research involves the use, evaluation, and categorization of the multitude of tools available to researchers and practitioners. As technology evolves at an increasingly rapid pace, the digital forensics field must constantly adapt by creating and evaluating new tools and techniques to perform forensic analysis on many disparate systems such as desktops, notebook computers, mobile devices, cloud, and personal wearable sensor devices, among many others. While researchers have attempted to use ontologies to classify the digital forensics domain on various dimensions, no ontology of digital forensic tools has been developed that defines the capabilities and relationships among the various digital forensic tools. To address this gap, this work develops an ontology using Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Ontology Web Language (OWL) which is searchable via SPARQL (an RDF query language) and catalogues common digital forensic tools. Following the concept of ontology design patterns, our ontology has a modular design to promote integration with existing ontologies. Furthermore, we progress to a semantic web application that employs reasoning in order to aid digital investigators with selecting an appropriate tool. This work serves as an important step towards building the knowledge of digital forensics tools. Additionally, this research sets the preliminary stage to bringing semantic web technology to the digital forensics domain as well as facilitates expanding the developed ontology to other tools and features, relationships, and forensic techniques.

AB  - Introduction: In response to COVID-19, governments imposed various restrictions on movement and activities. According to the routine activity perspective, these should alter where crime occurs. For burglary, greater household occupancy should increase guardianship against residential burglaries, particularly during the day considering factors such as working from home. Conversely, there should be less eyes on the street to protect against non-residential burglaries. Methods: In this paper, we test these expectations using a spatio-temporal model with crime and Google Community Mobility data. Results: As expected, burglary declined during the pandemic and restrictions. Different types of burglary were, however, affected differently but largely consistent with theoretical expectation. Residential and attempted residential burglaries both decreased significantly. This was particularly the case during the day for completed residential burglaries. Moreover, while changes were coincident with the timing and relaxation of restrictions, they were better explained by fluctuations in household occupancy. However, while there were significant decreases in non-residential and attempted non-residential burglary, these did not appear to be related to changes to activity patterns, but rather the lockdown phase. Conclusions: From a theoretical perspective, the results generally provide further support for routine activity perspective. From a practical perspective, they suggest considerations for anticipating future burglary trends.

AB  -  A study conducted for the National Institute of Corrections found that the skewed occupational distribution for men and women, particularly in the field of corrections, reflected the general pattern of gender polarization and gender segregation of occupations in the labor force.8 The rising work force participation of women has changed the occupational distribution very little, with women continuing to be concentrated in job categories characterized by limited mobility potential, low pay and low levels of power.9 Women employed in a field numerically dominated by men also face exclusion from informal work cultures; hostility expressed at the interactional level; organizational policies that promote gender segregation; differential assignments; and sexual harassment.10 In addition, support systems and networking opportunities available to men are not always available to women, nor do superiors choose to mentor or sponsor women as regularly as men.  The Virginia Experience Recognizing the scarcity of research relative to women as part of the correctional work force, Norfolk State University's Department of Criminal Justice designed a study in 2005 to examine the key issues relevant to the role of women working in community corrections.11 Using a descriptive research model, data was collected from the Virginia Department of Corrections to evaluate the trends of women in the community corrections work force.

AB  - Police officers strongly rely on their ability to visually perceive threats accurately and quickly on a daily basis. Previous studies have shown that training and practical experience improve performance in life-threatening encounters. The present study compared the gaze patterns of highly trained police officers of a tactical unit (TU) to matched patrol officers (MP) and unmatched patrol officers (UP) in realistic video scenarios using a mobile eye tracker and a USB arcade gun. As hypothesized, the TU fixated the tactically crucial hands and hip region of a suspect significantly longer than the MP and UP. Vice versa, the MP and UP fixated the suspect’s face significantly longer than the TU. The results indicate that tactical training enhances efficient gaze control to a greater extent than practical routine. Therefore, the authors recommend regular training and education on this topic for law enforcement personnel to minimize the risk of death or severe injuries in high-stress situations.
