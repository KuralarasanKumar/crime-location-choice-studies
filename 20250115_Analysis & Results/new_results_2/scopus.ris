AB  - Sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators is a particularly worrying phenomenon given that the severity of psychopathological sequelae for the victims are increased when the sexual offense is committed by more than one offender. Preliminary studies showed that sexual violence committed by solo offenders is different from that of duos or groups of offenders. This study explores the heterogeneity within 983 cases of sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators, with a focus not only on offenders’ modus operandi, but also victims’ routine activities and situational aspects of the crime. Results from a latent class analysis identified four offending patterns: sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators where: 1) stranger victims were randomly selected; 2) offenders were geographically mobile; 3) victims were assaulted during social events; and 4) offenders were non-sexually motivated. Findings help identify situational characteristics interacting with offenders’ behaviors and victims’ routine activities associated with sexual violence committed by multiple perpetrators. The implications regarding the heterogeneity of criminal patterns in these forms of violence is discussed in relation to police practice, situational crime prevention strategies, and future research. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Expeditious growth in e-commerce has emerged in an increasing number of online shopping societies. These shoppers rely on credit cards as a payment method or use a mobile wallet for their purchases. Thus, credit cards have become the main payment method in the e-world. Given the many transactions that occur daily, criminals propose tremendous opportunities to find different ways of attacking and stealing credit card information. Fraudulent credit card transactions are a serious business issue. These types of scams can result in significant economic and personal losses. As a result, businesses are increasingly devoted to developing new ideas and methods for detecting and preventing fraud, as well as acquiring their customer's trust and protecting their privacy. In recent years, learning algorithms have emerged as important in research fields aimed at developing solutions to this issue. In this paper, the proposed framework will develop a two-stage anomaly and fraud detection model that uses a strengthened anomaly clustering algorithm in the first stage to find fraud patterns in transactions. The second stage uses a learning classifier to detect fraud in transactions based on fraud patterns and clients' spending behavior. The transactions will be well balanced using hybrid sampling techniques to enhance the performance of the model. This framework also aims to optimize the learning classifier model, which will improve other existing models in terms of performance, computation time, and accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urbancontext by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations andpresence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods: The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results: The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closerto their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offendinglocations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors andgenerators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions: By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime locationchoice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discusslimitations and make suggestions for future investigations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - To unravel the conditions of application of street eyes theory and defensible space theory as well as the reasons of their theoretical dispute, this study took the central urban area of Beijing as research area and systematically explored the impacts of the permeable built environment on theft crime and the moderation effects of social disorganization on such relationships by integrating crime opportunity theory and social ecology theory. Big data from multiple sources during 2016 to 2020, including court records, location-based service data, street view images, points of interest, and road networks were used together. The results indicate that characteristics of permeable built environment such as land use density, mixing degree of urban functions, road network density, and transparency of street buildings all have positive and significant associations with the density of theft crimes in general. Furthermore, the direction and intensity of incluence of built environment features on criminal activities vary depending on the social ecological factors of communities. In other words, the degrees of social disorganization moderate the links between permeable environment and theft distribution. With social disorganization exacerbating, including the increase in residential instability, visitor mobility, employee mobility, population heterogeneity, and socioeconomic disadvantages, the positive effects of permeable built environment on crime will be steadily magnified, which more conforms to the defensible space theory. On the contrary, street eyes theory has better explanatory power in communities with stable social structure and abundant social capital where street eyes can be activated so as to provide effective informal surveillance to ensure safety. Unfortunately, according to the critical value of moderators estimated by the regression models, the later situation is less common in Beijing, suggesting that defensible space theory is more applicable in the majority of communities and the safety risks would increase when applying the approach of New Urbanism. © 2022, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - The purpose is to explore the impact of the business environment optimization by Criminal Law Regulation (CLR) on Entrepreneurial Spirit (ES) and Enterprise Development (ED) and to provide a reference for subsequent related research. Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

AB  - Introduction: In response to COVID-19, governments imposed various restrictions on movement and activities. According to the routine activity perspective, these should alter where crime occurs. For burglary, greater household occupancy should increase guardianship against residential burglaries, particularly during the day considering factors such as working from home. Conversely, there should be less eyes on the street to protect against non-residential burglaries. Methods: In this paper, we test these expectations using a spatio-temporal model with crime and Google Community Mobility data. Results: As expected, burglary declined during the pandemic and restrictions. Different types of burglary were, however, affected differently but largely consistent with theoretical expectation. Residential and attempted residential burglaries both decreased significantly. This was particularly the case during the day for completed residential burglaries. Moreover, while changes were coincident with the timing and relaxation of restrictions, they were better explained by fluctuations in household occupancy. However, while there were significant decreases in non-residential and attempted non-residential burglary, these did not appear to be related to changes to activity patterns, but rather the lockdown phase. Conclusions: From a theoretical perspective, the results generally provide further support for routine activity perspective. From a practical perspective, they suggest considerations for anticipating future burglary trends. © 2022

AB  - Environmental criminological research on rape series is an understudied field due largely to deficiencies in official and publicly available data. Additionally, little is known about the spatial patterns of rapists with a large number of stranger rapes. With a unique integration and application of spatial, temporal, behavioral, forensic, investigative, and personal history data, we explore the geography of rape of a prolific, mobile serial stranger rapist identified through initiatives to address thousands of previously untested rape kits in two U.S. urban, neighboring jurisdictions. Rape kit data provide the opportunity for a more complete and comprehensive understanding of stranger rape series by linking crimes that likely never would have been linked if not for the DNA evidence. This study fills a knowledge gap by exploring the spatial offending patterns of extremely prolific serial stranger rapists. Through the lens of routine activities theory, we explore the motivated offender, the lack of capable guardianship (e.g., built environment), and the targeted victims. The findings have important implications for gaining practical and useful insight into rapists’ use of space and behavioral decision-making processes, effective public health interventions and prevention approaches, and urban planning strategies in communities subjected to repeat targeting by violent offenders. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - For passengers using transportation, the expansion of ride-sharing platforms, various types of vehicles, and various riding services has presented new security and safety challenges. Passengers may experience accidents, injuries, harassment, and robbery-related incidents as a result of improper driver and passenger monitoring systems, illegal vehicle registration, careless driving, driver alcohol consumption, and sleep deprivation. To check the safety status of passengers in Bangladesh by examining driver and passenger behavior, aggressive driving, and unusual activity during transport driving, no appropriate ICT-based system or mobile application was available in the existing research. To address the issue of passenger safety, this paper presents an innovative mobile application that allows users to check the status of their transportation safety by analyzing driving patterns, suspicious activity, and the behavior of both drivers and passengers. Additionally, user IDs are verified, and users can select and book a driver by evaluating their availability, experience, cost, rating, post-query functionality, app reviews, and security force contact information regarding questionable travel behavior. Up to 73% of reviewers left positive comments about the app's usefulness and benefits, according to the app's competence and superiority analysis.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Harmful alcohol use is an important risk factor for premature mortality and morbidity and associated with increased HIV risk and lower uptake of and adherence to HIV interventions. This study aimed to assess the extent of harmful alcohol use and associated socio-structural vulnerability factors among female sex workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a key population in the HIV epidemic. Data from a study of female sex workers initiating pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) recruited through respondent driven sampling were used. We assessed harmful alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) defined as having an AUDIT score ≥ 16. Associations between harmful alcohol use and socio-structural factors were assessed using logistic regression with marginal standardization. Of the 470 women recruited, more than one third (37.3%) had a drinking pattern suggestive of harmful alcohol use. Such use was independently associated with sex work-related mobility (aPR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11–1.61), arrest/incarceration (aPR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.27–1.84) and gender-based violence (aPR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.56). The high prevalence of harmful alcohol use and the interconnectedness with socio-structural factors indicate a need for a holistic programmatic approach to health for female sex workers. Programming should not solely direct attention to individual behavior but also include strategies aiming to address socio-structural vulnerabilities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Fingermarks are an important form of evidence in forensic science, routinely used for identification or exclusion purposes within the criminal justice system. The increasing use of fingerprint recognition in technology and biosecurity, such as for unlocking devices and accessing banking information, highlights the need for forensic fingermark recovery methods that serve both traditional forensic needs and modern technological demands. Current fingerprint development techniques, however, are not designed to fulfil this dual-purpose. This paper presents a novel approach that introduces the use of conductive paint and silicone to develop, recover, and preserve latent, patent, and plastic fingermarks. The innovative method produces conductive casts that capture detailed ridge patterns, thereby facilitating forensic examination as well as being used for unlocking capacitive and ultrasonic fingerprint scanners in a range of mobile devices. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - As the spatial carrier of people's daily behaviors, the street network and behaviors therein constitute the main spatial environment of street network, which affects criminal behavior. Previous studies have shown that there are frequent cases of robberies and thefts in the streets, and the street network pattern and routine activity subjects are both related to crime. However, there are few in-depth explorations of such a relationship. Based on the police patrol area unit of the original DP District of HS City, this paper has adopted spatial analysis and statistical analysis methods to analyze the road network data, demographic data, mobile phone signaling data and other relevant data in order to explore the relationship between crime and street morphological characteristics including geometric and topological form, the relationship between crime and routine activity subjects including dynamic population and static population, and the impact of the street network on robberies and thefts. The results have shown that the factors affecting thefts and robberies in the street network are quite different. The factors affecting the theft crime are more complex. "X-cell" street network, road network density, road network permeability of low-speed traffic, static population density and dynamic population density all have an important impact on thefts. Only the branch density has a negative effect, and the rest of the factors have a positive effect. "T-cell" street network, density of actual residents and migrants in static population are related to robberies. But the street network pattern has not shown a significant correlation with robberies. In general, the street networks with more main roads, better accessibility, higher population density, and higher population mobility are prone to thefts. The street networks with many migrants are prone to the robberies. In addition, the findings of this study can also make certain extensions to the crime pattern theory. Since the accessibility of street network often brings risks, it is proposed at the end of the paper that it is imperative to consider how to reduce the crime risks as much as possible by regulating or improving the overall spatial environment of street network during the planning and construction of a safe street network environment in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - The disorders of urban micro-built and social environments ("urban microenvironment", UME in short) are key factors that affect the spatial and temporal pattern and formation mechanism of theft, as well as the opportunity, cost and means of crime. To understand the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of their impact on theft is the core content of CPTED and crime geography. This paper focuses on the progress on the link between UME and theft, systematically sorts out the characteristics of UME that affect the spatio-temporal differentiation of theft, and summarizes the measurements of UME. Overall, four issues need to be addressed urgently: (1) At present, the ambient population variables calculated by using mobile phone data are mainly population size and mobility, while the micro-social environment has not been precisely depicted by population′s demographic attributes and social regularity. (2) There is a lack of systematic research on the integration of micro-social and built environment, which may lead to pseudo-correlation or irrelevance. (3) The localized empirical research of Western criminological theories is not sufficient, and the theoretical connotation and concept are often difficult to be operated locally. The local knowledge generated by Chinese empirical research is somewhat complementary and challenging to Western criminological theories, but needs to be further "conceptualized internationally". (4) Street view has been used for virtual audit of micro-built environment, but randomly selecting audit sites lacks pertinence, because it paid no heed to the spatial variation of micro-social environment. Four avenues can be proposed for future research: (1) Cooperating with the public security department, employing sensitive data to measure micro-scale population attributes and social regularity, expanding the extension of the concept of "population at risk", and accurately reflecting the micro-social environment. Conducting theoretical and policy-oriented empirical research. (2) Coupling micro-social and micro-built environment, and analyzing the inter-embedding basis and coupling path of the two micro-environments from the multidimensional theoretical levels of society, environment, and behavior. Using "big" data to depict "micro" environment, and exploring the conditional interaction mechanism and scale dependence between the UME and theft. (3) Grasping the theoretical connotation of criminology, taking into account the social context of Chinese cities, and developing new possibilities for the local operationalization of the core concept of criminological theories. (4) Developing remote, virtual, automated and intelligent built environment observation methods based on street view, and paying attention to targeted sampling and systematic integration research. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - Purpose: Fintech is having a profound impact in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because it offers more financial inclusion. In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of Fintech, base of the pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the SSA context. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources. The authors interviewed respondents from the Sierra Leone Fintech Association and four BOP entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. Findings: The authors find that Fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. FinTech also offers growth possibilities for BOP entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. At the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing BOP entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development. Research limitations/implications: This study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between BOP entrepreneurship, social value creation and Fintech. For example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like Fintech. However, in a country like Sierra Leone, which has experienced both a civil war and Ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by BOP inhabitants. Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on Fintech's application in BOP contexts. Practical implications: A key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits. Fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. Fintech offers BOP entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating Fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more BOP entrepreneurs using these services. Social implications: The authors find that at the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of BOP consumers who interact with case firms. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on BOP entrepreneurship and social value creation by Fintech services in an SSA context. It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's Fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or Fintech firms. Finally, there is a specific focus on BOP entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A rich body of trans-disciplinary scholarship explores the relationship between technology, power, and gender injustice. However, political science analyses of violence against public-facing women have so far largely overlooked the peculiarities of technology-facilitated attacks. On the other hand, studies of digital gender-based abuse from the fields of psychology, criminology, gender and media studies mostly adopt an individual-level focus on either perpetrators or survivors. In the present chapter, I propose to connect these different streams of literature to provide a multi-level conceptualisation of digital violence against politically active women. Furthermore, I integrate a set of concepts and propositions from feminist and institutional theories, which I use to link micro-aspects of violent digital interactions to global patterns of white male radicalisation, as well as to the mobilisation strategies of political operators seeking to capitalise on the support of anti-feminist groups. In so doing, I shed light on emerging empirical trends, systematise existing knowledge, and advance theory-building efforts on the micro-foundations of patriarchal power and their ties to contemporary socio-political developments. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic provided an unprecedented environment for studying the impact of lockdowns and mobility restrictions on crime. Focusing on crimes, this study first detected emerging clusters of four types of crime (larceny, auto theft, burglary, and robbery) in Atlanta using space-time permutation scan statistics. We then investigated how the spatiotemporal patterns of these clusters changed during the pandemic (2020) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2019). Finally, we classified the detected clusters based on their duration and radius. Our results show that burglary clusters became shorter and smaller during the pandemic. The average duration and radius of statistically significant burglary clusters were 10.75 days and 0.79 km for 2019, but 6.86 days and 0.45 km for 2020, respectively. In contrast, we observed more larceny clusters that were temporally longer and spatially larger during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The duration and radius of statistically significant larceny clusters were 17.67 days and 0.46 km for 2019 and 23.22 days and 0.75 km for 2020, respectively. Furthermore, we noted a shift in the clusters from residential areas to commercial areas. We however detected a very limited number of auto theft and robbery clusters. Our findings have the potential to help prioritize future police force deployment and resource allocation in similar lockdown environments, such as pandemics or natural disasters. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - We investigate the concept of “criminal failure” in sexual crimes and the relevance of various theoretical frameworks for its understanding: individual offender's rational choice, environmental influences and routine activities, victimological characteristics from lifestyle theory, and crime interaction factors. We examined a sample of 1121 “failed” cases (i.e., attempted but not completed) and 1500 “successful” cases (i.e., completed) of sexual assault that occurred in France between 1990 and 2018. We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime. This understudied area can yield important theoretical knowledge and practical implications regarding the prevention of sexual crimes. © 2024

AB  - Identifying an unfamiliar caller's profession is important to protect citizens' personal safety and property. Owing to the limited data protection of various popular online services in some countries, such as taxi hailing and ordering takeouts, many users presently encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. The situation may be aggravated when criminals pretend to be such service delivery staff, threatening the user individuals as well as the society. In addition, numerous people experience excessive digital marketing and fraudulent phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, which does not work for the identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones might exhibit their application preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession-related information. This offers researchers and engineers a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies and regulations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation). We observe that appropriate statistical methods can offer an effective means to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, thus enabling the identification of the types of mobile phone callers without privacy concerns. In this paper, we develop CPFinder —- a system that exploits privacy-preserving mobile data to automatically identify callers who are divided into four categories of users: taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters, and normal users (other professions). Our evaluation of an anonymized dataset of 1,282 users over a period of 3 months in Shanghai City shows that the CPFinder can achieve accuracies of more than 75.0% and 92.4% for multiclass and binary classifications, respectively. © 2021 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications

AB  - Using data gathered from mobile devices and suspicious pattern detection algorithms, Mobile Forensic Data Analysis seeks to identify criminals. When criminal activity is associated with robotic processes like malware distribution, it is easy to foresee. When human behavior is involved, as in traditional crimes, prediction and detection become more alluring. Cyberbullying and small-scale drug sales, both of which rely heavily on mobile devices, are the focus of the current study, which proposes a combined criminal profiling and suspicious pattern identification methodology. Our evidence-based method improves accuracy and decreases false positives on a dataset by linking several observed patterns. After evaluating and displaying the results of tests conducted on a dataset that includes both benign and malicious traffic, the scenarios are re-run on a real dataset for further testing and verification. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

AB  - Government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on mobility patterns with implications for public safety and crime dynamics in countries across the planet. This paper explores the effect of stay-at-home guidelines on thefts and robberies at the neighborhood level in a Latin American city. We exploit neighborhood heterogeneity in the ability of working adults to comply with stay-at-home recommendations and use difference-in-differences and event-study designs to identify the causal effect of COVID-19 mobility restrictions on the monthly number of thefts and robberies reported to police across neighborhoods in Montevideo (Uruguay) in 2020. Our results show that neighborhoods with a higher share of residents with work-from-home jobs experienced a larger reduction in reported thefts in relation to neighborhoods with a lower share of residents with work-from-home jobs. In contrast, both groups of neighborhoods experienced a similar reduction in the number of reported robberies. These findings cast light on opportunity structures for crime but also on how crime during the pandemic has disproportionately affected more vulnerable areas and households. © 2022 Cornell Law School and Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - It has been found that the type of community housing has an important impact on the spatial pattern of burglary in urban areas. However, few scholars have explored the difference of the impact of different housing types in different degrees of population mobility on burglary. This study takes ZG city, a coastal city in southeast China, as a research area. It is based on theories of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, rational choice theory and social disorganization theory. This paper, taking community as the unit of analysis, adopts data of burglary, the sixth national census and Point of Interest (POI). The spatial lagged negative binomial regression method is used to analyze the impact of the interaction between community population mobility and housing types on the spatial pattern of burglary. Among them, the population mobility factors were extracted based on the proportion of migrant population and the proportion of renting houses. The results show that population mobility has a significant positive impact on burglary rate. There is a significant positive effect of the proportion of owner-built housing on the rate of burglary, and the proportion of former public owned housing and commercial housing has a significant inhibitory effect on the burglary rate. In addition, the impact of affordable housing on burglary is not significant. The results of the interaction variables found that the interaction coefficients of population mobility with different types of housing variables are varied. Among them, the interaction of population mobility with self-built housing, affordable housing and former public housing has a significant promoting effect on burglary rate, indicating that the higher the degree of population mobility, the greater the impact of these three types of housing on burglary. Nevertheless, the interaction effect of population mobility and commercial housing is not significant. This study proves that population mobility can further mediate the effects of different types of housing on burglary, and suggests that we should pay attention to the impact of the degree of population mobility in the community where different types of housing are located when discussing the relationship between different types of housing and burglary. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - In recent years, the police intervention strategy “Hot spots policing” has been effective in combating crimes. However, as cities are under the intense pressure of increasing crime and scarce police resources, police patrols are expected to target more accurately at finer geographic units rather than ballpark “hot spot” areas. This study aims to develop an algorithm using geographic information to detect crime patterns at street level, the so-called “hot street”, to further assist the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in capturing crime change and transitive moments efficiently. The algorithm applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique onto street networks, rather than traditional areal units, in one case study borough in London; it then maps the detected crime “hot streets” by crime type. It was found that the algorithm could successfully generate “hot street” maps for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), enabling more effective allocation of police patrolling; and bear enough resilience itself for the Strategic Crime Analysis (SCA) team’s sustainable utilization, by either updating the inputs with latest data or modifying the model parameters (i.e. the kernel function, and the range of spillover). Moreover, this study explores contextual characteristics of crime “hot streets” by applying various regression models, in recognition of the best fitted Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, encompassing eight significant contextual factors with their varied effects on crimes at different streets. Having discussed the impact of lockdown on crime rates, it was apparent that the land-use driven mobility change during lockdown was a fundamental reason for changes in crime. Overall, these research findings have provided evidence and practical suggestions for crime prevention to local governors and policy practitioners, through more optimal urban planning (e.g. Low Traffic Neighborhoods), proactive policing (e.g. in the listed top 10 “Hot Streets” of crime), publicizing of laws and regulations, and installations of security infrastructures (e.g. CCTV cameras and traffic signals). © 2022 Wuhan University.

AB  - Unidentified human remains have historically been investigated nationally by law enforcement authorities. However, this approach is outdated in a globalized world with rapid transportation means, where humans easily move long distances across borders. Cross-border cooperation in solving cold-cases is rare due to political, administrative or technical challenges. It is fundamental to develop new tools to provide rapid and cost-effective leads for international cooperation. In this work, we demonstrate that isotopic measurements are effective screening tools to help identify cold-cases with potential international ramifications. We first complete existing databases of hydrogen and sulfur isotopes in human hair from residents across North America by compiling or analyzing hair from Canada, the United States (US) and Mexico. Using these databases, we develop maps predicting isotope variations in human hair across North America. We demonstrate that both δ2H and δ34S values of human hair are highly predictable and display strong spatial patterns. Multi-isotope analysis combined with dual δ2H and δ34S geographic probability maps provide evidence for international travel in two case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that multi-isotope analysis in bulk hair of deceased border crossers found in the US, close to the Mexico-US border, help trace their last place of residence or travel back to specific regions of Mexico. These findings were validated by the subsequent identification of these individuals through the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, Arizona. In the second case study, we demonstrate that sequential multi-isotope analysis along the hair strands of an unidentified individual found in Canada provides detailed insights into the international mobility of this individual during the last year of life. In both cases, isotope data provide strong leads towards international travel. © 2022 Bataille et al.

AB  - Objectives: Routine activity theory suggests that levels of crime are affected by peoples’ activity patterns. Here, we examine if, through their impact on people’s on- and off-line activities, COVID-19 restriction affected fraud committed on- and off-line during the pandemic. Our expectation was that levels of online offending would closely follow changes to mobility and online activity—with crime increasing as restrictions were imposed (and online activity increased) and declining as they were relaxed. For doorstep fraud, which has a different opportunity structure, our expectation was that the reverse would be true. Method: COVID-19 restrictions systematically disrupted people’s activity patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions well-suited to testing the effects of “interventions” on crime. We exploit those conditions using ARIMA time series models and UK data for online shopping fraud, hacking, doorstep fraud, online sales, and mobility to test hypotheses. Doorstep fraud is modelled as a non-equivalent dependent variable, allowing us to test whether findings were selective and in line with theoretical expectations. Results: After controlling for other factors, levels of crime committed online were positively associated with monthly variation in online activities and negatively associated with monthly variation in mobility. In contrast, and as expected, monthly variation in doorstep fraud was positively associated with changes in mobility. Conclusions: We find evidence consistent with routine activity theory, suggesting that disruptions to people’s daily activity patterns affect levels of crime committed both on- and off-line. The theoretical implications of the findings, and the need to develop a better evidence base about what works to reduce online crime, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Telecom-network fraud is a complex and diversified social problem, which is related to people's well-being and social stability. With the data of China judicial documents network, using natural language technology of AI, combined with exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial econometric model, this paper systematically and deeply analyzes the spatial pattern and influencing factors of telecom-network fraud in China, based on the perspective of the source of crime. The research showed that: (1) The regional characteristics of the origin of the telecom network fraud are obvious, and the spatial pattern is“More in the north but less in the south, more in the east while less in the west, and more prominent in the middle”. Meanwhile, the spatial spillover effect is different between the south and the north. Hunan is the center of the south, and the spillover effect is outstanding. (2) The spatial choice of criminals is obviously different, the short-distance crime takes precedence over the medium- and long-distance crime, and the proportion of crimes in the province is much higher than that in other provinces. (3) Although telecom- network fraud is characterized by non- contact, but the criminals do not randomly choose the victims, instead they target at special victims. The spatial clustering of the crime occurrence is remarkable. The hot areas of criminal cases and the hot areas where criminals come from are highly overlapping, and the developed coastal cities have also become the hot areas of telecom network fraud. (4) The influencing factors of the spatial pattern of the origin of the telecom network fraud are different. Wage level, urbanization rate, education level, urban environment, urban administrative level have significant impacts on crime, but their mechanisms are different. Based on the macro- scale, this study provides empirical evidence and scientific reference for crime prevention and control. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mobile communications have become a vital domain for criminals and terrorists to exploit vulnerabilities, posing significant threats to public safety and national security. More precisely, they can employ cell site simulators such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers to intercept and monitor mobile communications, enabling eavesdropping, tracking individuals' movements, and potentially coordinating illegal activities while evading detection by law enforcement agencies. To overcome this issue, an innovative approach to detect IMSI catchers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models is proposed. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the developed models process multivariate time series data to distinguish suspicious patterns indicative of IMSI catcher presence. This work compares nine different model architectures based on CNN, LSTM, or a combination of both through a series of case studies. We demonstrate that LSTM-based and Parallel CNNLSTM models outperform other architectures, achieving high precision and recall rates. Then, the best two models are tested with several sequence lengths. The presented models serve as valuable tools, providing a further enhancement to the security of mobile networks. The goal of this research work is to contribute to the broader mission of integrating artificial intelligence within the daily investigative practices of law enforcement agencies.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Research on crime geography has traditionally focused on objective criminal activities and neglected subjective perceptions such as fear of crime, which is its major shortcoming. Using the deep learning algorithm of image regression, we analyzed the level of fear of crime under different streetscape environments on a large scale in the central urban area of Beijing. This approach compensates for the limitations of social surveys in terms of spatial coverage, spatial resolution, and reliability and validity of measures. Our indigenous deep learning models also make up for the lack of established models that rely on western city street view images and overseas labelers. Our study shows that, first, the spatial pattern of fear of crime has a circular, multi-cluster, and radial structure, and its level gradually increases from the city center to the suburbs. In contrast, the density/ number of theft and violent crimes have the spatial distribution with the opposite trend. Second, according to the relationship between the spatial distribution of fear of crime and criminal activities in general, we find a low match between subjective and objective security in the city center, with the objective situation being more dangerous than the subjective perception; in the suburban areas, the degree of match between the two increases; to the outer suburbs, these two still have a low degree of match, but the objective situation is safer than the subjective perception. Third, the built and social environmental factors that influence subjective and objective security are not always identical. A high-density and highly mixed environment would reduce fear of crime, but may accelerate crime. To reduce both fear and crime, it is recommended to add cul-de-sacs, improve the sense of enclosure, increase the amount of greenery, and eliminate various types of physical disorder. As for the effect of social disorganization, concentrated disadvantaged communities tend to have high levels of fear and are more prone to violent crime; population mobility can help reduce fear of crime; residential heterogeneity would exacerbate criminal behavior. Our findings help to clarify the differential explanatory power of classical crime geography theory for subjective and objective security, which in turn facilitates a comprehensive assessment of the security consequences of environmental intervention policies. © 2024, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - Graffiti is an integral part of public space, in cities and beyond. Spreading globally in its contemporary form for almost half a century, graffiti still retains symbolic and social connections to its subcultural origins in 1970s New York. Yet, graffiti is not only an interest of graffiti writers, but of numerous social agents and institutions too, including art dealers, museums, policy makers, academic scholars, journalists, law enforcement agencies and various corporate actors. As a result, the imageries of graffiti writing are bound up with a range of practices, each with its own scope and logic. This chapter taps into some of them. It engages with graffiti as image and practice before proceeding to discuss the suppression and commodification of graffiti writing, as well as the patterns of mobility and permanence in which graffiti often is encapsulated. To this end, the chapter reviews a relatively large (yet far from complete) collection of research, stemming from the humanities, social sciences and (socio)linguistics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Bente A. Svendsen and Rickard Jonsson.

AB  - Based on mobile phone data from the city of Barcelona, Spain, generalized linear models are used to analyse the relationship between urban mobilities and the spatial and temporal patterning of robbery and theft. The hypothesis was made that mobility fluxes may undermine social control mechanisms by altering the socio-demographic composition of urban populations, therefore increasing the risk of crime victimization. The analysis brought together indicators of land use and a measure of the ambient population disaggregated by different profiles of public space users (by sex, age, and place of residence). The results indicate that robbery and theft tend to cluster around locations that attract a higher proportion of non-residents (i.e. national and international visitors). Non-local visitors, who visit the city occasionally or once in a lifetime, lack a comprehensive knowledge of the environment which would help them to navigate safely through the urban space. Therefore, their presence not only unsettles the social routines of public spaces in Barcelona but also reflects negatively in terms of crime occurrence. This finding raises questions about how to accommodate growing mobilities in our cities without detriment to incumbent residents and their safety, which seems to be critical in post-COVID-19 urban planning. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The COVID-19 contingency gave rise to multiple social interactions for which neither governments nor citizens were prepared. The restrictive measures on mobility imposed by the National Government produced a series of changes not only in social dynamics and legal transactions, but also in the criminal context. The purpose of this study is to understand the space-time behavior of theft in the metropolitan area of Pereira, Colombia, and to compare this behavior observed under normal conditions and in times of pandemic. Data were obtained by consulting the Siedco application for the city studied in the 2019-2021 time window. The spatial analysis was performed using the technique known as pattern identification for space-time event networks (Ipree). The empirical evidence observed allows us to conclude that there is a space-time configuration that defines the dynamics of thefts in the city of Pereira and these patterns can be explained from the theory of environmental munificence for crime. © 2023 Policia Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Wireless technology has become increasingly crucial and contributes to both short-range and long-range communication applications, such as remote health monitors and smart homes. Given the expectation of high-dense wireless communications in sixth-generation networks (6G), radio sensing technologies have recently gotten much attention. This work demonstrates a novel technique to monitor criminals in a restricted-access building via radio sensing. The sensing is performed on the latest commercial WiFi device. Accordingly, the data are discretely collected at several common positions to build baseline signal patterns. Next, we propose a few-shot learning model to train on a limited dataset. The testing results show that our system can recognize the mobility of a criminal behind the door, even with sparse training data. In some hazardous circumstances, this application can let law enforcement officials figure out criminal activities without physical intrusion, thus mitigating potential risks. Further, this model can also be applied to other commercial wireless networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Preparedness for adverse events is critical to building urban resilience to climate-related risks. While most extant studies investigate preparedness patterns based on survey data, this study explores the potential of big digital footprint data (i.e. population visits to points of interest (POI)) to investigate preparedness patterns in the real case of Hurricane Ida (2021). We further investigate income and racial inequality in preparedness by combining the digital footprint data with demographic and socioeconomic data. A clear pattern of preparedness was seen in Louisiana with aggregated visits to grocery stores, gasoline stations, and construction supply dealers increasing by nearly 9%, 12%, and 10% respectively, representing three types of preparedness: survival, mobility planning, and hazard mitigation. Preparedness for Hurricane Ida was not seen in New York and New Jersey states. Inequality analyses for Louisiana across census block groups (CBGs) demonstrate that CBGs with higher income have more (nearly 8% greater) preparedness in visiting gasoline stations, while CBGs with a larger percentage of the white population have more preparedness in visiting grocery stores (nearly 12% more) in the lowest income groups. The results indicate that income and racial inequality differ across different preparedness in terms of visiting different POIs. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Estimates of intergenerational economic mobility for a recent U.S. birth cohort published by Opportunity Insights reveal a striking empirical puzzle: while there is a substantial gap in the upward mobility outcomes achieved by low-income Black and White males there is no such racial mobility gap for females. This study examines municipal police force size as a potential driver of these disparate mobility patterns. Although a larger police force may enhance mobility outcomes for all low-income children through reducing exposure to crime, for Black males prior work suggests this will be offset by the disparate negative impact of increased contact with the criminal justice system. Analyzing a sample of 200 major U.S. cities, linear models find a positive association between the number of police officers per capita and the size of the racial mobility gap for males, but not for females. We go on to show more police personnel in the late 1990s is associated with an increased gap in the likelihood of incarceration for Black males relative to White males. Taken together, our findings point to the heterogeneous impacts of policing for different race-sex groups as one potential explanation for why we observe a racial mobility gap between Black and White males and why this gap is larger in some cities and smaller in others. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study, based on data from 2015 to 2019 on the movement of offenders to the Metropolitan Region of Chile, uses Poisson and Negative Binomial models to analyze the flow of offenders from other Chilean regions. It confirms that factors such as gender, educational level, location of crime, and type of crime significantly motivate displacement. The profile of the typical offender is an educated man who commits crimes against property on public roads, coming mainly from neighboring and populated regions. These findings have implications for crime prevention, suggesting that strategies to prevent crime should take this into account. Future research at the commune level is proposed for a more detailed understanding of offender displacement patterns and to inform local crime-prevention strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This study used spatial interaction modeling to examine whether origin-specific and destination-specific factors, distance decay effects, and spatial structures explain the criminal trips of residential burglars. In total, 4041 criminal trips committed by 892 individual offenders who lived and committed residential burglary in Tokyo were analyzed. Each criminal trip was allocated to an origin–destination pair created from the combination of potential departure and arrival zones. The following explanatory variables were created from an external dataset and used: residential population, density of residential burglaries, and mobility patterns of the general population. The origin-specific factors served as indices of not only the production of criminal trips, but also the opportunity to commit crimes in the origin zones. Moreover, the criminal trips were related to the mobility patterns of the general population representing daily leisure (noncriminal) trips, and relatively large origin-and destination-based spatial spillover effects were estimated. It was shown that considering not only destination-specific but also origin-specific factors, spatial structures are important for investigating the criminal trips of residential burglars. The current findings could be applicable to future research on geographical profiling by incorporating neighborhood-level factors into existing models. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Mobile Forensic Data Analysis is an approach that aims to discover criminals by utilizing data collected from mobile devices and algorithms that detect suspicious patterns. In situations where criminal action is linked to automated processes, such as the propagation of malware, it is simple to anticipate the outcome. Prediction and detection become more appealing for situations in which human behavior is involved, such as in typical criminal cases. The current study suggests a combined criminal profiling and suspicious pattern detection approach. The study focuses on cyberbullying and small-scale drug sales, both of which rely extensively on mobile devices. Another focus of the study is on the identification of suspicious patterns. Through the connecting of several observable patterns, our evidence-based strategy leads to an increase in accuracy and a reduction in the number of false positives on a dataset. Immediately following the evaluation and presentation of the outcomes of tests carried out on a dataset that contains both benign and malicious traffic, the scenarios are re-executed on a real dataset for the purpose of conducting additional testing and verification. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2024.

AB  - This paper incorporates an explicit mobility dimension into the definition of the neighbourhood and explores its possible implications for the study of spatially distributed phenomena. We analysed the distribution of robbery and theft in Barcelona, Spain, as a testing application. Crime data were aggregated to nonoverlapping units (census tracts) and to a new measure of overlapping neighbourhoods, that we named ‘walkhoods’, accounting for the distance that can be covered in 5 min at a walking speed of 1 m/s, considering all possible physical barriers. The outcomes of regression models shed new light on the relationship between mobility and crime. When the walkhood scale is established, human mobility patterns have a stronger effect on the outcome variables than when census tracts are used. Results point to walkability constraints and social distances imposed by the massive presence of sporadic users in public spaces as strong predictors of crime occurrence, arguably due to their negative effects on neighbourhood social ties formation. Our findings suggest that more flexible definitions of the neighbourhood could address the social and spatial heterogeneity of urban spaces more properly than traditional approaches. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study makes use of a dataset recently collected among young people in Stockholm, Sweden (N = 1122), to investigate the impact of fear on young people’s mobility and precautionary behaviour, after controlling for previous victimization as well as situational characteristics of daily trips. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and logistic regression models underlie the methodology of the study. Previous victimization, especially for sexual crimes, triggers precautionary behaviour among young people using trains and the metro. Signs of poorly maintained transit environments also affect young riders’ mobility patterns, as they state that they avoid particular stations or routes at particular times. Informed by principles of environmental criminology and the theory of fear of crime, the implications of the findings for both theory and practice are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender - Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study analyses the influence of temporal factors on the dynamics of residential burglaries in the city of Cuiabá. For this, it uses routine activity and rational choice theories as theoretical reference. Despite analysing the distribution of such crimes by year, month, season, day of the week and period of the day, the statistical results only show that violent residential burglaries are more concentrated at night. However, the research indicates that residential burglaries have specific time patterns, which is of great importance to support public security policies in Cuiabá, which could adopt, for example, varied prevention strategies for different periods of the day and year. © 2023 Presses Universitaires du Septentrion.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates criminal nomadism—an individual's propensity to engage in continuous or intermittent interurban travel as a way to cope with the consequences of their criminal lifestyle and/or as a strategy to adapt to the reality of being a “career criminal.” Methods: The criminal-career itinerary across Canada of 448 men convicted of sex offenses was reconstructed through individual interviews and analysis of detailed criminal records. Five distinct components of criminal nomadism (i.e., trips, nodes, paths, range, and mesolevel activity space), inspired by crime pattern theory, are suggested and analyzed. Results: Results show that criminal nomadism is the reality of young and educated Whites who have a prolific criminal career interspersed with long incarceration sentences. Nomadic offenders did not wander freely and randomly, but rather seemed to be looking for opportunities and privacy. Sex-offending variables did not make a significant contribution to predictions, suggesting that criminal nomadism is more a general offending phenomenon than something specific to sex offending. Conclusions: This study provides supporting evidence that an extensive criminal career is generally associated with a geographically scattered and nomadic lifestyle. Implications for public policies and future studies are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ambient population has been regarded as an important indicator for analyzing or predicting thefts. However, the literature has taken it as a homogenous group and seldom explored the varied impacts of different kinds of ambient populations on thefts. To fill this gap, supported by mobile phone trajectory data, this research investigated the relationship between ambient populations of different social groups and theft in a major city in China. With the control variables of motivated offenders and guardianship, spatial-lag negative binominal models were built to explore the effects of the ambient populations of different social groups on the distribution of theft. The results found that the influences of ambient populations of different social groups on the spatial distribution of theft are different. Accounting for the difference in the “risk–benefit” characteristics among different activity groups to the offenders, individuals from the migrant population are the most likely to be potential victims, followed by suburban and middle-income groups, while college, affluent, and affordable housing populations are the least likely. The local elderly population had no significant impact. This research has further enriched the studies of time geography and deepened routine activity theory. It suggests that the focus of crime prevention and control strategies developed by police departments should shift from the residential space to the activity space. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Face recognition is a growing technology that has been broadly employed in forensics applications such as unlawful person identification, security, and authentication. Computer vision problems now find application in all spheres of the digital world ranging from a normal person’s routine mobile face ID login to institutional facial attendance system to national security-based software to identify criminals. The proposed work examines the performance of face reorganization model using CNN with SVM classifier. Two phases are involved in the creation of the facial recognition system. The first stage involves picking up or extracting facial features, while the second step involves pattern classification. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has made significant strides in FR technology in recent years but most of the existing models considered only one or two parameters but the proposed work computed all important performance parameters, i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Further, the time required to train the model and its prediction time are also computed in this study. The efficiency and dominance of the proposed method are compared with several face detection algorithms, i.e., Eigenface, Fisherface, and Lbph, and results clearly show the supremacy of the proposed approach over the traditional approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Extensive criminological research has documented a ‘distance-decay’ effect in criminal activity, with offenders less likely to commit crimes farther from their residences. While recent studies have identified similar patterns in ideologically motivated violence, variation in the travel behaviors of extremists remains underexplored. Using data on right-wing extremists who carried out a violent plot, between 2000 and 2020, alongside information on Capitol insurrectionist arrestees–and drawing on routine activity and rational-choice theories of offender decision-making–this study extends this literature along three dimensions: type, time, and ties. First, we distinguish between different types of offenders, showing that while both violent extremists and insurrectionists exhibit distance-decays, the latter tend to travel farther and exhibit a more irregular decay. Secondly, we identify a meaningful temporal shift in the right-wing extremist landscape, with offenders increasingly traveling longer distances to execute their plots. Finally, we highlight the role of social ties in shaping travel behaviors, where individuals affiliated with extremist groups tend to travel longer distances. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the spatial behavior of right-wing extremists, the factors influencing their mobility, and the evolving nature of right-wing extremism in the United States. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is important in the field of forensic identification and criminal investigation and requires fluorescent materials with near-infrared (NIR) emission to suppress the background fluorescence, with simultaneously high selectivity for fingerprints; however, this remains a challenge. Herein, we rationally designed and prepared a new NIR-emissive composite material composed of an NIR fluorophore, i.e., (E)-4-(7-(4-bromophenyl)imino) methyl)benzo[C][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (BrBTN), and porous starch through a simple grinding method. The BrBTN powder exhibited strong NIR emission with a high quantum yield of 0.209. Porous starch enabled high adsorption ability for fingerprints. Using the BrBTN@starch composite, clear images of the tertiary structure of a fingerprint with NIR emission on various substrates were obtained under 405 nm light excitation within 10 s using a mobile phone alone after a simple dust removal treatment. Benefiting from its strong NIR emission and high selectivity, the imaging resolution of the fingerprint fluorescent patterns based on the NIR composite was 3-times higher than that of commercial fingerprint powder. This work provides a novel strategy for the design of highly emissive NIR fingerprint powder with the advantages of reduced background fluorescence, easy operation, high photostability, low cost and low toxicity to developers, indicating its great potential in the field of trace inspection and biological imaging. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The neighborhood effect of environment characteristics has been an important topic in social sciences that are concerned with people's behaviors. However, defining a neighborhood and its aggregation scales are difficult challenges for the studies using neighborhood characteristics. Previous studies generally adopted fixed administrative units as the neighborhood and chose the same scale for all the variables due to data availability. Aggregation scales have a significant influence on examining the relationships between area-based input variables and outcome variables, but how to optimize the scale for each variable has been less investigated. This study proposes a multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework for simultaneously determining the optimal scale for each neighborhood environment variable and building an optimized multiscale model. First, we developed multiscale extraction methods for the socioeconomic and built environment characteristics within overlapping neighborhoods based on different types of data, including fine-grained mobile phone user data and point of interest data. Next, we proposed a random forest-based scale optimization method to quantify the impact of scales and determined an optimal spatial scale for each variable. Third, we used urban burglary risk modeling as an example, to demonstrate the usefulness of the scale optimization method. In the comparison, the model using an optimized multiscale feature set (R2 = 0.843, F1 score = 0.797 for high-risk samples) achieved better accuracy than all the models using fixed-scale combination feature sets. Moreover, the results revealed that there might be differences in the optimal scale of different neighborhood environment characteristics and demonstrated the effectiveness of our scale optimization method. Our multiscale feature extraction and scale optimization framework is well suited for assessing the neighborhood effect in social sciences. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Objective: With COVID-19 came a range of public health measures that impacted people’s routine activities. According to routine activity theory, these could affect the rate and nature of crime. This has largely been examined with volume crime (e.g., burglary, robbery) or crimes committed in the home. Stranger sex offenses greatly vary in nature and occur in a range of settings; therefore, these offenses present a novel opportunity to investigate different routine activity theory-based hypotheses. Method: The National Crime Agency routinely collects detailed information about all stranger sex offenses reported to the police in the United Kingdom. With these standardized data (N = 6,422), we studied the relationship between COVID-19 public health measures and the rate and characteristics of stranger sex offending across the entire first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasting this with data from the same period pre-COVID-19. Results: Our findings accord with classic criminological theory whereby the incidence and characteristics of U.K. stranger sex offenses reported to police covaried with the population’s patterns of mobility and national lockdowns during the first year of COVID-19. This impact on routine activities also manifested in differences in perpetrator and victim behavior and characteristics. Conclusions: Our study supports the applicability of routine activity theory to sex offending and brings new insights regarding the situational prevention of sex offending during major events such as a pandemic. It is also relevant to the urgent need to educate prosecutors who are now making decisions about sex offenses perpetrated during the early years of this pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This study examines the trends in and spatial distribution of recorded offending by Australian outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) affiliates at the onset of a territorial conflict between two clubs in the state of New South Wales. Results show an increase in recorded offending by OMCG affiliates involved in the conflict and based in the disputed territory. Comparable increases in recorded offending by these clubs were not detected in the areas surrounding this territory or in the rest of New South Wales, and there was little mobility into the conflict region by those outside of it. There was a smaller, short-lived increase in recorded crime by affiliates of other gangs in the conflict region but not elsewhere. In short, changes in offending patterns were largely limited to the clubs involved in the conflict and localised to the territory in dispute. This research can help guide focused law enforcement responses during periods of gang conflict. © 2023 Australian Institute of Criminology. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of recent South America migration governance. Recent migration dynamics in South America have been marked by intra-regional and extra-regional mobility patterns. While such intra-regional movements have had as their destination mainly countries of the Southern Cone-such as Argentina, Chile and Brazil-recent mobility has also changed migration patterns in countries such as Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. In particular, the exodus of more than seven million Venezuelans has led to significant changes in migration flows and policies in the region. This chapter reflects on the changes in migration governance in South America in the last decade, and how it has been framed and justified through the lens of "multiple crises". The chapter argues that South America has been developing a patchwork approach to migration governance, characterised by fragmented and reactive measures, with practices that evidence both continuity and change. The development of this approach is leading to more control, the criminalisation of migration, increased migrant irregularity and less protection for people on the move. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - With the rapid development of the economic and social situation and the improvement of public security defense and governance, the quantity of cases of child trafficking by means of theft, forcible robbery, and deception has decreased significantly, and the offense of selling offspring has shown an obvious increasing trend. Based on the case data of child trafficking crime on the website of Chinese Judicial Documents, this study examines the spatiotemporal pattern and criminal decision-making mechanism of offense of selling offspring. The results are as follows: (1) Sold children are characterized by "younger age, " most of them are zero-year-old infants, and males are far more represented than females. Most sellers are young and middle-aged men or young women, mainly unemployed, farmers and workers. They sell their offspring to buyers with strong demand through social networks of acquaintances, special occupational groups, traffickers, network media, or persuasion by buyers/intermediaries. The reasons for selling include economic difficulties, out of wedlock birth, extra births, intermediary solicitation, debt repayment. (2) Temporally, the annual change of crime can be divided into three stages: stable sequence and low incidence, rapid growth and sustained high incidence, and steady decline, which are mainly affected by China's population policy, action on combating trafficking, and the development of the website of Chinese Judicial Documents. The monthly change presents a synchronous trend on the birth and betrayal time of the children, with spring and summer being more represented than autumn and winter. (3) Spatially, the origin region of selling presents the pattern of "three sources" with "Sichuan-Shandong-Fujian" as the core, and the destination region of selling presents the pattern of "North-South two sinks" with "Shandong-Fujian" as the core on the macro level. Microscopically, it occurs in closed spaces with a frequent flow of people, and residential buildings and open spaces with a frequent flow of people. The overall trafficking path is "inter-provincial flowing out from the southwest source area and intra-provincial flow of the South-North sink area. " Inter-provincial migration is mostly driven by interests and is dominated by trafficking criminal groups, while intra-provincial migration is mostly formed by temporary one-time gang crimes to meet the needs of buying and selling. (4) Based on the theory of rational choice, this study constructs a decision-making framework for the offense of selling offspring, and finds that the crime is mainly affected by the comprehensive influence of background factors, previous experience, and situational induction, and the bounded rational choice made by potential criminals under the decision-making evaluation of "benefit-cost-risk. " After deciding to sell their children, potential criminals will choose the appropriate time, place, and way to maximize interests. © Starobulgarska Literatura 2022.

AB  - The study of geographic mobility through geospatial analysis and journey-to-crime approaches has made progress in environmental criminology, finding most offenders commit crime close to their residence. However, extant literature on serial homicide and geographic mobility is scarce, specifically lacking a comprehensive appraisal of relative research. To gain a better understanding of the geographic mobility patterns of serial homicide offenders, we must determine the current status of literature in this area, to figure out where to go in terms of future research. Therefore, the following study is a scoping review of existing literature on geographic mobility and serial homicide and four associated typologies (Holmes & DeBurger’s Geographic typology, Hickey’s Mobility typology, Canter’s Circle typology, and Rossmo’s Hunting Style typology) to achieve the following: (1) Comprehensively evaluate literature regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and four associated typologies to establish the current status of research; (2) uncover potential literature gaps; and (3) provide future research recommendations. Literature sources (N = 43) on serial homicide and geographic mobility (1985–2018) were examined. While findings recognize the relevance of mobility functions in serial homicide investigations, gaps in literature were evident regarding serial homicide geographic mobility and the four associated typologies. Findings also reveal that systematic research in this field is limited. Policy implications and future research recommendations are discussed. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Gait recognition is a biometric identification method based on individual walking patterns. This modality is applied in a wide range of applications, such as criminal investigations and identification systems, since it can be performed at a long distance and requires no cooperation of interests. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition systems, and previous studies have utilized depth information captured by RGB-D cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect. In recent years, multi-layer LiDAR sensors, which can obtain range images of a target at a range of over 100 m in real time, have attracted significant attention in the field of autonomous mobile robots and self-driving vehicles. Compared with general cameras, LiDAR sensors have rarely been used for biometrics due to the low point cloud densities captured at long distances. In this study, we focus on improving the robustness of gait recognition using LiDAR sensors under confounding conditions, specifically addressing the challenges posed by viewing angles and measurement distances. First, our recognition model employs a two-scale spatial resolution to enhance immunity to varying point cloud densities. In addition, this method learns the gait features from two invariant viewpoints (i.e., left-side and back views) generated by estimating the walking direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention block that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise weights to fuse the features from the aforementioned resolutions and viewpoints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-view, cross-distance challenges, and practical scenarios.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Oceans have always been arenas of crime, drugs and human trafficking, and poaching. When such violations occur on fishing boats, they fall under the rubric of “fisheries crime.” Political scientists and economists have tended to assume that these criminal fishers simply abandon their legal occupation and take up illegal practices, labelled “transnational organized fisheries crime” by the United Nations. On the other hand, some scholars have also argued that subsidized and militarized fishers in the South China Sea are simply acting as instruments of their states’ geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations, non-enforcement of regulations, and incentives. Such present-centric approaches both obscure the modalities of fishers’ embodied skills and knowledge and their motivations, and downplay the inter-ethnic networks that connected different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting the spike in maritime trespass in (and out of) the South China Sea, this article combines ethnography and historiography to show how fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader, smuggler, and militia. I propose the concept of occupational slippage as a way of going beyond the fiction of fishing as mono-occupational and theorizing the realities of fishers as mobile maritime actors who enact and conceal multiple—simultaneous and consecutive—livelihood strategies while navigating not just seas, but also markets and territorial sovereignties. Thus, I argue that the fishers’ practices reflect wider interconnections between modern, state-supported, and technology-driven fisheries with older pre-nation-state patterns of mobility and knowledge accumulated through generations, producing new forms of versatility that operate under the states’ radars. © 2022, Institute for Ethnographic Research.

AB  - In the contemporary era, computer vision applications assume significance due to their role in the real world. Video surveillance is one such application that has become indispensable with plenty of unprecedented applications. Detection of abnormal events from surveillance videos in real time has its importance in applications like traffic monitoring, crime investigation, public safety, healthcare and operations management to mention few. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) automatic video surveillance is taken to the next level with sophistication in learning detection of anomalies. Particularly deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is found more appropriate for image processing. However, as one size does not fit all, CNN does not provide acceptable accuracy unless it is enhanced with suitable number of layers and configurations. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning architecture known as VidAnomalyNet which is based on CNN model. It is designed to have more appropriate learning process and detection of anomalies from surveillance videos. We proposed a framework to exploit our VidAnomalyNet architecture for leveraging detection performance. We also proposed an algorithm known as VidAnomalyNet for Automatic Anomaly Detection (VAAD). Automatic anomaly detection in the context of video anomaly networks refers to the use of computational methods to automatically identify unusual or abnormal patterns within a sequence of video frames. The goal is to develop models that can distinguish between normal activities and unexpected events or anomalies. Video anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, including surveillance, industrial monitoring, and public safety. At present, this algorithm detects three classes of anomalies like fire, accident and robbery. It can be easily extended to identify more number of anomalies. We also explored MobileNetV1 with transfer learning by adding new layers to the base model for video anomaly detection. Our empirical study has revealed that VidAnomalyNet outperforms MobileNetV1. Highest accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 96.35%. ©2024 The authors.

AB  - This article examines the problem of the special emotional regime of hard labour prisons in the Russian Empire in the early twentieth century in the context of the social construction of emotions characteristic of a revolutionary community. The paper aims to identify the determinants of the success of the revolutionary movement in the events of 1917. The author focuses on the mechanisms of communication of political prisoners and the role of the emotional component in the formation of a stable system of social interaction in a revolutionary environment. Employing the methodology of the history of emotions and comparative analysis, the author studies both previously known historical sources (letters of F. E. Dzerzhinsky) and archival materials (perlustration of letters from prisoners of the Smolensk convict prison) which have not been studied before. The article demonstrates how the special conditions of imprisonment shaped the emotional regime of hard labour prisons and contributed to the formation of a revolutionary community. With classical communication mechanisms limited, prisoners developed alternative means of communication. Also, the author pays special attention to the peculiarities of the written language of political prisoners and its evolution in conditions of hard labour and interaction with the criminal environment. The main results of the study are related to the term “emotional code” as a characteristic communication mechanism (“friend or foe” system) within a revolutionary community. In the context of the social processes of the beginning of the century, the opposition to the growing social melancholy on the part of the revolutionary community stands out. It was not only able to build communication mechanisms that were reliable and closed to external analysis based on similar emotional patterns but also used emotional constructions for agitation and propaganda in the public environment. Specific images of the future and the positive emotions associated with it have become a constructive alternative to the negative phenomena that prevail in the public consciousness during the last years of the empire’s existence. The main “weapon” of the revolutionary community in 1917, along with propaganda, was empathy, highly developed emotional intelligence, and the ability to accurately capture the emotions of one’s surroundings. The article concludes that labour prisons were “laboratories of emotions” which played a significant role in the crystallisation of the revolutionary community and the formation of its mobilisation potential. © 2023 Ural Federal University.

AB  - Social science researchers face risks when studying deviant or criminal behavior, especially when researching violent extremism online. The author emphasizes the importance of acquiring necessary skills to operate safely and anonymously. In the (cyber-)social ecosystem characterized by the centrality of a new dimension of human experience that goes beyond the internet and social media, the Left-Wing Extremism and Violent Left-Wing and Anarchist Extremism (VLWAE) constitute an important challenge for security. The author provides guidelines for conducting online research on Left-Wing Extremism entities using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), while ensuring digital hygiene and safety, to study their online activities, propaganda, and radicalization strategies. OSINT enables researchers to collect information from various sources, including private and encrypted messaging channels, to understand the organization and mobilization of extremist campaigns. The use of various tools and techniques is presented to highlight the most relevant elements that should be included in a research report on left-wing extremism target. The author also focuses on the importance of technological innovation to support research in this field. Moreover, a strong integration between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and OSINT is revolutionizing online investigations of left-wing extremism and other forms of extremism and terrorism. AI-based technology allows researchers to analyze large amounts of images, videos, and data with the aim for identifying patterns and trends. In the near-future scenario, AI will be used in extremist individuals and entities profiling to anticipate new onlife security threats. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023, corrected publication 2024.

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders’ knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders’ pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members’ home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge—where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities—and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders’ crime location choices. © 2024 Georgia State University.

AB  - Purpose: In this research, I investigated the link between collective mobility patterns—specifically inward population flow and residential mobility—and changes in reported gun violence incidents in Baltimore City. I also examined whether this relationship differs among various types of gun violence. Furthermore, I explored the potential moderating influence of collective mobility patterns on the relationship between neighborhood hotspot coverage and occurrences of gun violence. Methods: The data were sourced from a blend of mobile device location data, Part 1 crime data from the Baltimore Police Department, the American Community Survey, and the zoning map of Baltimore. I used Poisson regression with Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (MESF) for the analysis. Results: Inward population flow consistently exhibited a positive relationship with gun violence regardless of its subtype, whereas residential mobility demonstrated significant influence primarily on firearm-related robbery incidents. Moderation analysis indicated that depending on the type of gun violence being assessed, either inward population flow or residential mobility could attenuate its association with neighborhoods' crime hotspot coverage. Conclusions: Understanding collective mobility patterns is crucial for comprehending the spread of gun violence. Such insights can assist law enforcement agencies in refining hotspot policing strategies and adapting police tactics accordingly. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although repression against elites is a common occurrence in authoritarian regimes, we know little about which elites are targeted. This paper uses an original dataset on the prosecution of mayors in large Russian cities to examine the factors that make elites more likely to be arrested. We argue that in electoral authoritarian regimes like Russia, regime leaders are reluctant to arrest popular officials. Such officials command political capital that is useful to the regime, and arrests of prominent officials can produce popular backlash. We examine this argument using an original dataset on all arrests of municipal leaders in Russia’s 221 largest cities between 2002 and 2018. We find that mayors who won their elections by large margins are less likely to be arrested. In addition, we document several other substantively important patterns: (1) a mayor’s professional background is not related to the likelihood of arrest, (2) opposition mayors are four times more likely to be arrested, and (3) mobilization of votes for the regime is not protective against arrest.

AB  - Emotion dysregulation (ED) has primarily been described in patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) and is an integral part of this diagnosis, but it is also a transdiagnostic construct that can be found in several other psychiatric disorders. The strong relationships between ED and BPD may lead clinicians to underestimate ED associated to other clinical contexts. This can lead to difficulties in diagnostic and treatment orientation, especially in the context of comorbidities. In this article, after reviewing the literature on the development and functioning of emotion dysregulation, and on the evidence for emotion dysregulation in eight disorders (borderline personality disorder, pathological narcissism with/without narcissistic personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), we present a transdiagnostic processual model of emotion dysregulation based on core triggers and interpersonal styles to try to address this issue and to provide a simple but technical tool to help clinicians in their diagnostic assessment and treatment orientation. By focusing more on typical patterns and interpersonal dynamics than only on categories, we believe that this model may contribute to the actual need for improvement of our current psychiatric classifications, alongside other well-studied and under-used dimensional models of psychopathology (e.g., HiTOP, AMPD), and may be useful to build more specific treatment frameworks for patients suffering from ED.

AB  - What happens when militant groups must choose between logistical needs and ideology, and how does that trade-off impact subsequent violence? Many groups balance both strategic and psychological considerations but ultimately weigh one more heavily than the other. We propose a typology based on this trade-off between logistical and ideological resources and the degree of violence against civilians. We propose that combination produces four overarching ideal types: violent militants, militant opportunists, professional militants, or disciplined militants. We conduct a plausibility probe of the types and propose a model of how groups re-produce violence patterns once established. The four cases – the Weather Underground, al-Qaida in Iraq, the Revolutionary United Front, and autodefensas in Mexico – are extreme cases that vary in their calculus of logistics versus ideology and their degree of violence. We find that all types go through a standard process to establish and perpetuate their approach to violence. In addition, groups experience different advantages and pitfalls based on their trade-off calculus. An ideological emphasis is typically accompanied by greater oversight of recruitment and tactics, but groups that become too ideologically rigid risk collapsing from organisational problems and difficulties connecting with their constituents. Conversely, those that weigh logistical considerations more heavily have less oversight over recruitment, which increases their risks of infiltration by opportunists and criminals. © (2024), (Terrorism Research Initiative).

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases—100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) has proven to be a useful tool in forensic and criminal investigations for quite some time. Traditionally, documenting a crime scene for a bloodletting event was completed using manual techniques, physical strings, and a tape measure. In more recent years, laser scanners and 3D software programs have become a preferred method to capture accurate data that improves the validity and reliability of BPA. The initial cost of laser scanning equipment is relatively high, rendering these systems inaccessible to some police and smaller agencies. Recon-3D is a newly developed iPhone application that utilizes the iPhone LiDAR sensor in combination with video data to create 3D point clouds of crime scenes. To assess the viability of Recon-3D for area of origin analysis, two tests were performed. One was a series of bloodstain impacts which were analyzed in FARO Zone 3D software, while the second was a series of 6 repeated Recon-3D scans of two 90-degree walls which was then compared to the FARO Focus S350 scanner using CloudCompare software. A total of eight impact patterns were made at three different distances from a wall. The area of origin was measured and compared to the known location of the blood source. The average total 3D error for the area of origin set at 25, 50, and 100 cm from two perpendicular walls was found to be 6.04, 15.16, and 36.59 cm, respectively. These results are similar to past studies where programs such as HemoSpat have been used. The results of the point cloud comparison show that on average, 95% of the points from Recon-3D fall below a threshold of 3.6 mm when compared to a FARO Focus S350 laser scanner. Thus, the results of this test suggest that Recon-3D is an accurate and affordable scanning application for bloodstain patterns at crime scenes and the data provide acceptable results for area of origin analysis in BPA programs which accept laser scanner data. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Do neighborhoods have boundaries? Scholars have debated how neighborhoods should be operationalized for decades. While recent scholarship has de-emphasized boundaries, I argue that boundaries are focal to understanding what neighborhoods are and why they are so segregated. Relying on everyday mobility patterns data from a panel of 45 million nationally representative devices, I demonstrate that divisions between contiguous census block groups in terms of everyday mobility patterns align with divisions in race, educational attainment, occupation, and age. Employing a novel clustering procedure, I further demonstrate that sets of census block groups can be easily separated in terms of differences in mobility patterns, indicating that meaningful clusters and boundaries within cities do exist. Subsequent results indicate these clusters are uniquely segregated in terms of race, educational attainment, and age, highlighting how other spatial aggregations can underestimate true segregation. Additional results suggest that unique social processes divide these clusters from one another, as indicated by exceptional variation in both COVID-19 case incidence and criminal offense timing. While I do not believe these clusters represent objective “neighborhoods,” I do assert that they can serve as a useful geographical unit for social analyses. These clusters may also be useful for measuring segregation in mobility patterns as well as for studying mobility network resiliency. © 2024 Karl Vachuska.

AB  - Objective: We investigate the role that neighborhood socioeconomic contexts and defendant mobility patterns play in prosecutorial charge reductions. Methods: Using data from a large sample of criminal defendants prosecuted during 2010 to 2011 in New York County (N = 68,113), we analyze differences in charge reductions for defendants who reside and offend in low- and high-income areas, and for those who traverse socioeconomically divergent neighborhoods when committing crime. Results: Net of individual defendant characteristics, like gender and race, we find that defendants from low-income neighborhoods who offend in high-income locales are significantly less likely to benefit from discretionary charge reductions. Conclusions: Defendant mobility patterns play a key role in defining the social context of criminal punishment. This suggests it is essential to consider both where a defendant resides and where their crime is committed when assessing the role of ecological stereotypes and place-based attributions in criminal court actor decision-making. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Crime location choice has been a central theme of crime geography research. However, the current research reveals little about the spatial differences among different age groups of criminals when they choose crime locations. Using kernel density estimation and discrete spatial choice models in ZG City, China, this study aims to explore the spatial variation in crime location choices of street robbers at different ages. We also examine the different influences of activity nodes, supervision role, and social disorganization on crime location choice. The results demonstrate that there are significant spatial differences in crime location choices by street robbers at different ages. Juvenile robbers tend to commit crimes in labor-intensive industrial clusters and primary and secondary school areas, young adult robbers tend to commit crimes only in labor-intensive industrial clusters, and adult robbers prefer urban areas with transportation hubs. Additionally, this study demonstrates that age-related activity nodes, the supervision role of the ambient population, and the proportion of youngsters are the main factors for such spatial differences. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Cybercafés have impact on crime location choices of juvenile and young adult robbers, while transportation hubs affect those of young adult and adult robbers, and bars and schools influence all the three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. (2) The supervision role exerted by the ambient population is greater for young adult and adult robbers compared with juvenile robbers. (3) Young adult robbers are more likely to target communities with more youngsters but juvenile and adult robbers are not. (4) Journey to crime has a significant negative effect on target choices, especially on juvenile robbers. In addition, these findings have great informative value for crime prevention and social governance. For example, (i) in labor-intensive industrial clusters where juvenile robbers frequently commit crimes, we can regulate the number of age-related activity nodes such as cybercafés and bars; (ii) in transportation hubs and their surrounding communities where adult robbers commit crimes intensively, we can encourage the persistence of the ambient population to persist and play a better supervision role; (iii) in communities predominated by youth population, we can survey delinquent juveniles to enhance the precise guidance and support. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In recent decades, historians working on crime and gender have been focusing on the interplay between female crime and the urban setting. Subsequently, migration has become increasingly important within the research field. While this development has led to new findings regarding women's participation in crime in early modern metropolises, in contrast, little is known about prosecuting patterns in smaller urban centers in predominantly rural regions. This situation is particularly true for less urbanized territories, such as the geographical area of the Swiss Confederation. It is often assumed that women in big cities led more mobile and independent lives than their counterparts in smaller towns. This socio-economic difference in female profiles is used as the main explanation for the disparities in gendered patterns in the registration of criminality. By analyzing the records of the criminal court of seventeenth-century Protestant Bern, this article aims to contribute to the understanding of women's crime in early modern urban territories. The findings demonstrate that smaller towns could also show high levels of female defendants. However, the city of Bern was not a place of relative freedom for women. Rather, the opposite is true: the authorities' control, focusing on an ordered society and household, led to strong formal control of mobility and (im)morality, which had a lasting impact on the prosecution of women. This policy, the article argues, is the main explanation for the high percentage of recorded female delinquency. © 2023 Netherlands Institute of International Relations. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital technologies have recently become more advanced, allowing for the development of social networking sites and applications. Despite these advancements, phone calls and text messages still make up the largest proportion of mobile data usage. It is possible to study human communication behaviors and mobility patterns using the useful information that mobile phone data provide. Specifically, the digital traces left by the large number of mobile devices provide important information that facilitates a deeper understanding of human behavior and mobility configurations for researchers in various fields, such as criminology, urban sensing, transportation planning, and healthcare. Mobile phone data record significant spatiotemporal (i.e., geospatial and time-related data) and communication (i.e., call) information. These can be used to achieve different research objectives and form the basis of various practical applications, including human mobility models based on spatiotemporal interactions, real-time identification of criminal activities, inference of friendship interactions, and density distribution estimation. The present research primarily reviews studies that have employed mobile phone data to investigate, assess, and predict human communication and mobility patterns in the context of crime prevention. These investigations have sought, for example, to detect suspicious activities, identify criminal networks, and predict crime, as well as understand human communication and mobility patterns in urban sensing applications. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted on crime research studies that were published between 2014 and 2022 and listed in eight electronic databases. In this review, we evaluated the most advanced methods and techniques used in recent criminology applications based on mobile phone data and the benefits of using this information to predict crime and detect suspected criminals. The results of this literature review contribute to improving the existing understanding of where and how populations live and socialize and how to classify individuals based on their mobility patterns. The results show extraordinary growth in studies that utilized mobile phone data to study human mobility and movement patterns compared to studies that used the data to infer communication behaviors. This observation can be attributed to privacy concerns related to acquiring call detail records (CDRs). Additionally, most of the studies used census and survey data for data validation. The results show that social network analysis tools and techniques have been widely employed to detect criminal networks and urban communities. In addition, correlation analysis has been used to investigate spatial–temporal patterns of crime, and ambient population measures have a significant impact on crime rates. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The Space-Time Budget (STB) method is used to collect spatial and temporal features of an individual’s activities and is an important technique to explore relationships between the environment and crime. This spatial and temporal approach to the study of everyday activity spaces reveals much about victimisation experiences, the relationship between place, time, and perceptions of safety, and where and when offending may occur. Few studies, however, consider the relationship between living in a criminogenic place (neighbourhood crime) and people’s daily activity patterns. Drawing on disaggregate app-based data for 50 participants tracked over a 7-day period, we use sequence analysis to first delineate time allocation to each activity on a minute-by-minute basis. Next, using result from the sequence analysis we introduce the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to understand how neighbourhood crime and socio-demographic characteristics influence individuals’ time allocation to discrete daily activities. Results reveal that neighbourhood drug and violent incidents exert restrictions on an individual’s propensity to spend time outside the home. Females and older people appear more likely to be constrained by the presence of neighbourhood crime (in particular drug and property incidents) as they allocate less time to outdoor activities. The principal utility of the current study is its methodological advancement and the practical insights for urban planning regarding the design of crime prevention strategies to increase guardianship in public places. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - With the advancement in technology, the importance of person recognition in photographs or videos has grown due to its usefulness in the search for wanted persons and criminal identification using various theories and algorithms and various non-hybrid and hybrid techniques to identify the person through the face, and its features have been developed. The paper proposed a hybrid algorithm to improve the performance of person identification in video files. The system works through several steps: first, face detection using Viola–Jones algorithm; second, feature extraction by algorithm local binary pattern (LBP); final, person identification by hybrid proposed algorithm (HPBFF) by hybrid between backpropagation neural network and firefly algorithm. The results show that the system was able to identify and monitor the person with a high classification accuracy rate of 98.4%, compared to 94.7% for the approach without the hybrid. The results of the tests revealed that the system is robust and has a high recognition rate, making it suitable for use in mobile and compact identification and authentication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the rapid growth in the use of smartphones, the digital traces (e.g., mobile phone data, call detail records) left by the use of these devices have been widely employed to assess and predict human communication behaviors and mobility patterns in various disciplines and domains, such as urban sensing, epidemiology, public transportation, data protection, and criminology. These digital traces provide significant spatiotemporal (geospatial and time-related) data, revealing people’s mobility patterns as well as communication (incoming and outgoing calls) data, revealing people’s social networks and interactions. Thus, service providers collect smartphone data by recording the details of every user activity or interaction (e.g., making a phone call, sending a text message, or accessing the internet) done using a smartphone and storing these details on their databases. This paper surveys different methods and approaches for assessing and predicting human communication behaviors and mobility patterns from mobile phone data and differentiates them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. It also gives information about spatial, temporal, and call characteristics that have been extracted from mobile phone data and used to model how people communicate and move. We survey mobile phone data research published between 2013 and 2021 from eight main databases, namely, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, SAGE, Science Direct, Scopus, SpringerLink, and Web of Science. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 148 studies were selected. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, environmental criminologists have explored the application of agent-based models (ABMs) of crime events and various theoretical frameworks applied to understand them. Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort. © 2023

AB  - This paper proposes a framework to examine how neighborhood factors influence criminal justice (CJ) contact and contribute to disparities across multiple stages of the justice process. By conceptualizing the punishment process as a dynamic set of decision-making points, this study highlights the role of neighborhood context in shaping offenders’ CJ trajectories and post-CJ residential inequality. Using Harris County, Texas, as a case study, this research considers individual-, neighborhood-, and event-level variables to understand the cumulative effects of neighborhood characteristics on CJ outcomes. This study underscores the critical need to investigate neighborhood mobility and its broader implications for community development and public policy. The findings can be supported by extensive data from the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers and the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System, offering a robust analysis of offenders’ spatial patterns and economic transitions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Criminal behavior, which takes its content from society, has been associated with social isolation, national quarantine, and mandatory stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been researched through crime rates. Moreover, it has been argued that changes in the level of social mobility also affect crime rates. Decreased crime rates have been reported during closure measures, and a significant literature has emerged based on these propositions. This study's retrospective approach was created to examine the appearance of crime rates in Türkiye. The main problem of the research is to reveal the relationship between crime, pandemic, and social mobility in Türkiye. For this purpose, it aimed to test the propositions based on a dual approach. First, patterns in crime rates were discovered. The data set regarding the most common crime types between 2018 and 2022, including pre-pandemic crime rates, was used. The most appropriate time series model was determined to understand the data structure regarding crime types, and it was tested whether there was a decrease or increase in crime rates during and after the pandemic. As a second step, the effect of social mobility on the change in crime was examined according to the mobility level data reported in this process. Evidence has shown decreased violence, theft, and drug crimes in the early part of the pandemic, consistent with the literature. While theft crimes decreased throughout the pandemic, violence and drug crimes increased. The view that crime rates will decrease if social mobility is restricted as a source of social life presented overlapping data in the pandemic. Changes in social mobility during the pandemic have affected crime rates for theft, injury, and drug use. Although there was a decrease in crime rates due to seasonal effects after the normalization process, it was observed that crime rates could change according to the content of social measures during the pandemic period. It is considered that this situation presents a particular slice for the future. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the dynamic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on property crime in Mexico. We do so for a longer time horizon than the existing literature and for two types of property crime: on-line and on-site. Methods: A retrospective ecological analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic using an event study methodology. This paper uses administrative data from Mexico’s National Public Security System from January 2017 to December 2022. Our data is structured as a monthly series covering all 2457 Mexican municipalities. Results: We find heterogeneity in the pandemic’s impact by type of property crime and a dynamic, permanent effect for both types of property crime. Namely, our results point to a drop and quick recovery of fraud—property crime mostly committed on-line—, which in the medium run surpasses pre-pandemic levels by 44%. Further, our results point to a significant drop in robbery, theft, domestic burglary, and motor vehicle theft—all property crimes committed on-site—, with a slight recovery after the end of the national lockdown, even though rates for these crimes never reached pre-pandemic levels. Conclusions: The 2020 pandemic caused a permanent shift in property crime from on-site to on-line spaces. Potential mechanisms point to disruptions in mobility in retail and recreational areas, residential zones, and workplaces as important mediating factors. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Wildlife crime, especially in the notably hard-hit region of Sichuan and Chongqing, constitutes a pivotal research domain within green criminology research. Taking this region as the core research area, grounding our analysis in the theoretical framework of social-ecological systems theory, using spatial analysis, geo-detector and other methods, to explore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and influencing factors of wildlife crime in the Sichuan-Chongqing region. Study findings include the following: (1) wildlife crimes in the Sichuan-Chongqing regions mainly involve illegal hunting and killing precious and endangered wildlife, the species involved are predominantly birds and beasts, with the number of pheasants of the pheasant family, owls, and various snakes of the reptile family being the most numerous. The main body of the offence is far more men than women, and young adult Han people are often involved. The overall cultural level is low, and the main job is farming. (2) A single wildlife crime often involves a number of offenses; the most common criminal process involves (seller) hunting/hunting-killing-transportation-selling- (buyer) acquisition. (3) The overall inter-annual variation of the crime shows strong volatility, which can be divided into a gradual growth phase, a sharp decline phase and a sharp growth phase, the monthly distribution is high in November. (4) The overall pattern of "high incidence in the east and west and low incidence in the center" is shown in the city scale; in the county scale, the Shuangliu District of Chengdu City and Wanzhou District of Chongqing City are the most common. In microplaces, there are differences in the main places where offences are committed and transacted under different offences. (5) The occurrence of crime is mainly affected by the average annual temperature, total water resources, the state of natural ecosystems and other natural factors, male and female gender ratio, level of education, transport network density, ease of access and other socio-economic and cultural factors; the level of consumption of the population, the rate of natural growth and the combination of other factors have a significant impact on wildlife crime. The integrated crime pattern theory and rational choice theory suggest that by rationally considering multiple factors such as the natural environment (e. g. abundant wildlife resources and hidden habitats), the social environment (e. g. weak regulation, strong market demand or weak public awareness of protection) and their own psychological characteristics (e. g. the relationship between costs and benefits), offenders are more likely to convert their criminal intent into actual action, which will in turn The criminal intent is more likely to be transformed into actual action, thus contributing to the eventual occurrence of the criminal behaviour. © 2024 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

AB  - This study looks at the spatial distribution of robbery against residents as a function of nonstationary density and mobility patterns in the most densely populated city in Spain, Barcelona. Based on the geographical coordinates of mobile devices, we computed two measures of density of the ambient population and the tourist presence, for work days, weekends, and holidays in 2019. Negative binomial regressions are then estimated to analyse whether these measures are correlated with the risk of robbery, controlling for land use and the characteristics of the social environment. The model reveals that residents’ chances of being exposed to robbery in Barcelona depend on the social relevance and tourism attractiveness of certain places at particular times of the year. Our results disclose two sources of social disorganization as stronger predictors of the occurrence of robbery in Barcelona, respectively linked to structural processes of residential instability and daily and seasonal mobility patterns. On the one hand, we found that the effect of the density of international tourists on the outcome variable is mediated by residential volatility, which is assumed to be associated with housing shortages in neighbourhoods where short-term vacation rentals are widespread. On the other hand, the ability to exert effective social control is significantly undermined in urban areas, where the ambient population and the volume of tourists outnumber the resident population, thus increasing incidents of robbery victimization. The implications of these findings for urban policy and crime prevention in the Catalan capital are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - It requires innovations to accurately predict crimes and offending risks due to the complex nature of human behaviors within different social contexts. In recent years, theory-based and data-driven agent-based models have become useful tools in computational criminology with the abundance of public data, the rise of computing powers, and extensive explorations of related theories and modeling tools. In this paper, we present CARESim, an integrated simulation environment to predict the risks of high-risk individuals committing street violent crimes. The simulation environment combines agent-based modeling with a real geographical information system and incorporates public data (e.g., environmental data, crime data, census data, and transportation data) to reproduce authentic human mobility. This simulation environment is capable of replicating crime patterns and evaluating policies. We demonstrate the use of this environment and illustrate how key factors, such as social networks, the neighborhood, the weather, police patrol strategies, the population, and citizens’ behaviors, impact the risk of street-level violent offending. Furthermore, the environment can support the optimization of patrol strategies and offer evaluations of different social setups that could be unfeasible or expensive to test in real life. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research includes an analysis of total crime with a detailed insight into common or con¬ventional crime in the five-year period before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (2015- 2019) compared to the year of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Empirical analysis is based on secondary data of registered crimes and misdemeanors for this purpose requested and ob¬tained from the Croatian Ministry of Interior, which is an indirect measurement of crime in a particular area (Palmer, 2020). The problem of exploratory research in this paper is the acquisition of new cognition about possible changes in the scope, structure and dynamics of crime and the typology and patterns of police registered crimes and offences in the pandemic crisis period, compared to the previous five years in Croatia. The obtained results are observed through the applicability of theoretical concepts of environmental criminology in explaining the change of trends in typology and patterns of criminal and deviant behavior. The purpose of the research was to show how the emerging pandemic influences everyday life and affects the mobility of overall crime in general, but also the specific segments of crime in the Republic of Croatia and individual police directorates. © 2021 Institut za društvena istraživanja u Zagrebu–Institute for Social Research in Zagreb Sva prava pridržana–All rights reserved.

AB  - 3D-reconstructed relocation of spectral feature is a key technology in multi-spectral imaging fusion and 3D reconstruction. Here, the feasibility was to explore about relocating spectral data onto 3D-reconstructed dense point cloud through a new neural network HF-Net, one deep-learning-based AI technology and also a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that is able to simultaneously predict local features and global descriptors for spectral localization. Such an HF-Net was adopted to carry out the spectral relocation of heterogeneous localization. Specifically, the MobileNet and NetVLAD layers were taken to extract the global descriptors among the dataset of three-dimensional color point cloud from the spectral image so as to find the approximate position of spectral image in the three-dimensional point cloud. With the conjectural locations obtained through the prior global retrieval within those candidate places, the SuperPoint was utilized to get the local descriptors and key point scores of the spectral image so that the matching spectral points were found in the three-dimensional point cloud, therewith having mapped out the spectral information and three-dimensional reconstruction pattern. By leveraging the learned descriptors, this assay achieved remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance, demonstrating more robust and efficient than SSD algorithm. Due to limits with GPU (graphics processing unit) memory, the extracted spectral features were down-sampled from image to the largest resolution of 6016 × 4512 pixels. With HF-Net being trained through multi-task distillation in TensorFlow 1.12, a spectral image had been able to relocate into 3D reconstruction pattern in 12s under having run on the device of NVidia TESLA V100 with 32G memory and CPU of Intel (R) Xeon (R) Silver 4114 with 12G memory. The approach proposed here can realize the fine positioning of 3D spatial information and spectral features of 3D physical evidence. At present, there seems no such an exploration in forensic science home and abroad, revealing that the exploration tried here is a new application of artificial intelligence to the full-dimensional imaging data fusion technology of physical evidence. Such an HF-Net-based relocation is accurate, scalable, efficient, and a monolithic deep neural network choice for descriptor extraction, capable of achieving higher exactness on large-scale multi-spectral imaging fusion and 3D reconstruction. © 2022, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

AB  - The majority of geographical profiling research focuses on the relationship between offender and location, which works particularly well when a burial site is known. In real-world investigations, however, burial or dump sites are often not known. The aim of the current paper is to outline a relatively under-used method of geographic profiling: Winthropping. While the method has been around for several decades, few studies have provided any research findings using it. There are two likely reasons for Winthropping being under-used: first, it has not been clearly, theoretically explained; second, given its relative novelty, it may not be immediately clear how to use it in research and real-world scenarios. The current paper outlines several key psychological (e.g., satisficing and affordances) and criminological (e.g., rational choice theory and crime geometry) theories that may explain why Winthropping works. Case studies are provided, and a methodological approach (matrix forecasting) is then provided to show how it could work in research practice and real-world applications. Overall, Winthropping is deemed to be highly useful, and it is hoped that experts in the field will begin developing this tool for wider, applied use. © 2021, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines how sexuality, gender, and severity affect the willingness of third parties to mobilize facets of the criminal justice system in response to witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: An M-Turk online sample of 803 adults in the USA completed a factorial vignette survey. Participants were presented with an incident of intimate partner violence and asked to report how likely they would be to notify police and select jail as punishment for the perpetrator. Results: Results of the study uncover no clear evidence of heteronormative bias. Rather, female victims of IPV garner the most support from third parties. Furthermore, respondents were more likely to favor a jail sentence for male perpetrators. Patterns were amplified in severe incidents. Conclusion: The current study suggests that gender and violence severity, rather than sexuality, are the most salient predictors of the third-party’s decision to notify the police and prefer strong criminal justice punishments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - This study investigated researchers in criminology dealt with their research data and explored the potential factors that would influence their willingness to share and reuse others’ research data through a qualitative approach. With a total 13 participants with two small focus group sessions as well as in-depth interviews, our findings unveiled three factors, trust, contract, and value, deeply rooted in researchers’ attitudes and their data sharing and reuse patterns and behaviors. Through comprehending their concern behind sharing and reusing research data, we seek crucial insights that could be beneficial in developing a criminological research data repository, further consolidating the research data infrastructure in social science. Sharing and reusing data can advance scientific research and provide innovative possibilities for practice in criminology (e.g., new correctional methods, new crime prevention policies), providing sustained and thriving energy for the field. © 2023, National Taiwan University, Department of Library and Information Science.

AB  - This study aims to identify the main types, their magnitudes of influence, and their characteristics of regional heterogeneity of theft places, and take the lead in discussing the application of geographical detector in the field of crime geography analysis. Using criminal judgement, Points of Interest, Location-based Service data, road network, census data, housing data, and other data in the central urban area of Beijing and taking the 1 km×1 km square grid as our spatial analysis unit, this research demonstrates that thirty-seven types of urban facilities belong to the major crime generators, crime attractors or crime enablers at the global level, and the edge areas of roads, administrative districts and land uses are also proved to be evident theft locations. Among them, the more influential theft locations are more aligned with the crime generating conditions proposed by crime pattern theory, including accessible crime target and lower risk of arrest. Second, as stated by social disorganization theory, if the level of social disorganization composed by mobility factor and housing factor decreases, the number of theft location types as well as their impacts will gradually diminish. But except for the low social disorganization districts, the rankings of relative influence of various facilities and edge areas on theft crime remain relatively stable. Third, geographic detector has the advantages of no linear hypothesis, no collinearity problem, clear physical meaning and so on. But owing to the neglect of the potential interference by confounding factors, geographical detector would probably overestimate the impacts of independent variables. It can be testified by the moderate correlation between the rankings of the overall influence of theft locations obtained from the negative binomial regression and those calculated by the geographical detector. We suggest that combining elimination control method with geographical detector is a feasible path to achieve robust results, so classification discussion after grouping units with similar confounding factors is essential to overcome the potential endogeneity problem if we use geographical detector in crime geography as well as other sub-fields of human geography. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - The overall aim of the paper is to present evidence on the factors underpinning historical deportation cases, by exploring the reasons, explanations and patterns related to deportation in Australia. The purpose is to consider whether these historical factors are antecedent to current forms of deportation occurring in Australia, and to bring to the fore potential recurring patterns. Deportation is currently conceptualised by border criminologists as a punitive tool of discipline and control, within the realm of penal powers. Some of this work on the 'deportation regime' asserts that certain migrants, or groups of migrants, are undesirable: their identity, (not)belonging and punishment have become inherently intertwined, and their mobility has become politicised and criminalised. This article theorises that deportation has been used in Australia, now and in the past, to expel individuals who are viewed as detrimental to the 'health' of the host society. The 'deportation categories' demonstrate that migrants' desirability has historically been a temporary condition, shifting over time in line with the state's requirements. They also demonstrate the historical regime of criminalisation of undesirable others enacted through Australia's border control regime.  © The Author/s 2023.

AB  - This project will be focused on effective recognizing and controlling system for Bank locker room which is fully self- determining. In cases of robberies, it commonly happens that the banned entrance in locker room area which can be detected by our security system. If the robbery take place the banks are not capable to recognize the robber due to absence of the proof by using the current human security operated system. The system will be designed in effective way by recognizing and controlling the illegal person to access the locker for the safety of bank lockerroom. In this, we proposed a three-phase conformation of procedure for smart locker using some registered pattern knocks,camera and SMS which check out the user. As we compare to any other previous approaches our system uses the web App which send an OTP to user’s mobile which has to be opened using android app which highlights the smart security. The designed system is highly proficient and consistent because of three security stages and not capable to break the combination of this, three stages. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.

AB  - This article explores the courtroom behaviour of adherents of the oppositional dissenter wing within the Evangelical Baptist community in the Soviet Union, who faced trials for violating Soviet religious laws between the 1960s and 1980s. The analysis reveals that the accused believers developed a nuanced defence strategy encompassing three core elements: mobilizing support from their fellow believers in courtrooms, constructing communicative patterns that involved drawing prosecutors and judges into theologically driven dialogues about truth, and employing distinctive rhetoric aimed at questioning the legal foundations and legitimacy of Soviet religious policy. The accused Baptists adopted a marked confrontational stance towards state officials in charge of criminal prosecutions and trials, striving to overcome them in argument. Ultimately, the courtrooms became a platform for them to voice and promote their faith-based views on state politics and freedom. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Women environmental defenders face retaliation for mobilizing against extractive and polluting projects, which perpetrate violence against Indigenous, minority, poor and rural communities. The issue matters because it highlights the gendered nature of extractive violence and the urgent need to address the systemic patterns of violence that affect women defenders, who are often overlooked and underreported. Here we analyse violence against women defenders in environmental conflicts around the world. We use data from the Environmental Justice Atlas and employ log-linear and binomial regressions to find statistically significant patterns in displacement, repression, criminalization, violent targeting and assassinations committed against women defenders in extractive conflicts. Statistical results indicate that violence against women defenders is concentrated among mining, agribusiness and industrial conflicts in the geographical South. Repression, criminalization and violent targeting are closely linked, while displacement and assassination appear as extreme outcomes when conflict violence worsens. Women defenders experience high rates of violence regardless of countries’ governance accountability and gender equality. This work contributes to the broader sustainability agenda by highlighting the need to address the impacts of extractive activities on women. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The proliferation of online language violence and online bullying deeply affects college students in a critical period of forming worldviews and values. The invention and application of mobile internet technology have broadened the communication channels of virtual society, and more and more netizens are expressing their views on social issues through the internet. There is an urgent need to analyze the mechanism of online language violence, explore governance strategies for online language violence, strengthen ideological and political education in universities, and adapt to the romantic situation of college students in the era of the internet. This study starts with the characteristics of online bullying in universities. It analyzes the derivation and dissemination mechanisms of campus online bullying through statistical analysis of the development patterns of campus online violence in typical network events. Research has found that online violence is mainly spread through platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, mainly through group or private chat attacks. At the same time, online violence can increase the crime rate among teenagers through theft and robbery. Campus online violence will have a profound impact on the growth of teenagers from both practical and psychological perspectives. Intervention in ideological and political education on campus and blocking online platforms within a week of online violence are essential means of organizing campus online violence. Meanwhile, continuous ideological and political education can significantly reduce the crime rate among minors caused by online violence. © (2023), (Elite Scientific Publications).

AB  - We investigate the spatial decision-making of graffiti writers when selecting target locations, examining how street segment characteristics influence exposure. Extending the rational choice perspective to expressive offending, we collected data through Systematic Social Observation in Ghent’s city center in November 2017, covering 12,655 graffiti instances across 2,233 street segments. The SSO involved counting graffiti items and public facilities likely to attract crowds, and measuring street network centrality. Conditional logit models assessed the impact of these characteristics on graffiti location choices. Results show that street network centrality and the presence of bars, night shops, residential units, and schools significantly increased graffiti writers’ preferences. Our findings suggest that graffiti writers aim to maximize exposure, highlighting the rational choice perspective’s relevance for expressive offending. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Malware attacks on the Android platform are rapidly increasing due to the high consumer adoption of Android smartphones. Advanced technologies have motivated cyber-criminals to actively create and disseminate a wide range of malware on Android smartphones. The researchers have conducted numerous studies on the detection of Android malware, but the majority of the works are based on the detection of generic Android malware. The detection based on malware categories will provide more insights about the malicious patterns of the malware. Therefore, this paper presents a detection solution for different Android malware categories, including adware, banking, SMS malware, and riskware. In this paper, a novel Huffman encoding-based feature vector generation technique is proposed. The experiments have proved that this novel approach significantly improves the efficiency of the detection model. This method makes use of system call frequencies as features to extract malware’s dynamic behavior patterns. The proposed model was evaluated using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the proposed model with the Random Forest classifier outperforms some existing methodologies with a detection accuracy of 98.70%. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The world has seen exponential growth in deploying Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In recent years, connected IoT devices have surpassed the number of connected non-IoT devices. The number of IoT devices continues to grow and they are becoming a critical component of the national infrastructure. IoT devices' characteristics and inherent limitations make them attractive targets for hackers and cyber criminals. Botnet attack is one of the serious threats on the Internet today. This article proposes pattern-based feature selection methods as part of a machine learning (ML)-based botnet detection system. Specifically, two methods are proposed: the first is based on the most dominant pattern feature values and the second is based on maximal frequent itemset mining. The proposed feature selection method uses Gini impurity and an unsupervised clustering method to select the most influential features automatically. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods have improved the performance of the detection system. The developed system has a true positive rate of 100% and a false positive rate of 0% for best performing models. In addition, the proposed methods reduce the computational cost of the system as evidenced by the detection speed of the system.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This article studies legitimate businesses confiscated from mafia groups in Italy to assess whether mafia investment patterns across industries depend on the characteristics of the geographical environment in which infiltrated firms operate. We carry out a spatial regression analysis of more than 1700 firms, with special emphasis on restaurants/hotels and construction, confiscated from mafia groups in Italy against a set of variables related to the social and criminal environment (with a special emphasis on mafia presence) after controlling for the local business structure and the economic/financial composition of the areas. Ceteris paribus, mafia investments in the construction industry are greater in regions with a higher level of mafia presence, infiltration of public administration and more protected markets; while investments in bars, restaurants and hotels are greater in areas characterized by less rooted mafia presence, higher violence, higher trade openness and cash intensity. The results suggest that mafia investments in construction can benefit from the opportunities offered by grip on the territory and on the public administration; and those in restaurants by concealment drivers, such as money laundering. This article contributes to the understanding of the geography of mafia economy and of the mobility of mafia groups beyond territories of origin, by highlighting the possible instrumental use of legitimate businesses, and the relationship between mafias’ migration and infiltration mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Recent studies focus on how to accurately measure ambient population and its effects on crimes. However, limited attention has been paid to the internal heterogeneity of ambient population composition and its temporal variation. To fill these gaps, controlling for indicators of ambient population, social disorganization, crime generators and attractors, we model the effects of the share of low income, middle income, upper-middle income and high income of ambient population at the community level in the whole and specific time periods on weekdays and weekends. Results suggest that while all income groups of the ambient population contribute to theft at the community level, their contributions are not uniform. At different periods of both weekdays and weekends, there is no single income group that consistently predicts theft. Furthermore, the magnitude of the impact of each income group fluctuates with time. Our results highlight the heterogeneous segments of the ambient population, coupled with the dynamic human mobility patterns, structure the convergence of the crime triangle – motivated offenders, potential targets, and guardianship – in nuanced yet crucial ways. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The timely identification of potential criminal travel routes of key surveillance individuals is a crucial research focus for public security early warning systems. Current studies often concentrate on the travel patterns and destination preferences of criminals, but there is a lack of research from the criminals' perspective, considering the built environment and road network structure to analyze their criminal travel routes. To address this gap, a spatiotemporal analysis approach is proposed, considering criminals' cognition of concealment. Based on the principles of criminal psychology and rational choice theory, this paper categorizes the travel patterns of criminals under the cognition of concealment into two principles: "the Principle of Minimal Exposure Risk" and "the Principle of Minimal Travel Cost". Firstly, the urban perceptual elements within a criminal's perceptual range, including safety and risk perception elements that bring exposure risks, are calculated and introduced into the choice degree model. The "Criminal Choice Degree of Roads" is proposed to measure the optimal local roads within a criminal's perceptual range. Next, using the "Length of the Route Already Traveled" as the cost function and the "Criminal Choice Degree of Roads" within the perceptual range as the heuristic function, an improved heuristic algorithm is employed to calculate the overall optimal criminal travel route. Finally, from the perspective of crime prevention and control, experiments are conducted to analyze the distribution of urban road choice degrees and the criminal travel routes of key personnel. By comparing the routes obtained by this method with those derived from existing methods and actual criminal travel routes, it is shown that the routes calculated by this proposed method are more reasonable. They are more likely to be chosen by criminals for concealment and have relatively short travel distances, without long-term exposure in public areas. The routes, in terms of distance, travel time, and the urban perceptual elements they pass through, are closer to the actual travel behaviors of criminals, verifying the rationality of this method. The research conclusion provides decision support for public security early warning efforts, emphasizing the importance of balancing travel distance and exposure risk when monitoring key personnel, and the need to allocate resources based on the distribution of urban perceptual elements and road networks to enable timely and accurate crime prevention and interception. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Recent literature indicates the destruction of human remains using hydrochloric acid (HCl, 38%) is often attempted to obscure the identity of victims or as a disposal method. Dentition are informative in an investigation where acid is used as a means of body disposal, as teeth are more likely to survive intact. Importantly, researchers studying acid immersion have not observed immature dentition, nor have they analyzed immature acid-treated teeth using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This study analyzes the effects of HCl on immature human molars, with two goals: understanding the timing and nature of physical changes to immature molars caused by HCl immersion, and aiding in the identification and age determination of dental tissues partially or nearly completely destroyed using HCl. Our results indicated that immature human molars immersed in HCl follow a pattern of physical changes and decrease in weight as they dissolve similar to mature molars, although the timing of dissolution is affected by their smaller size and incompletely developed roots in a predictable way. With less root material present and an open root tip, we observed that HCl can more quickly penetrate the pulp cavity of immature molars. The mobile SEM images indicated immature and mature molars immersed in HCl exhibit similar changes at the microscopic level. Immature molars treated with HCl for over 18 h exhibited cracking features similar to those visible on mature molars that were difficult to differentiate from similar features on untreated teeth (both mature and immature) when images were taken at 3,000x or less. The appearance of features such as peeling layers and lamination at high magnification (6000x) were visible on both acid-treated mature and immature molars, but were not visible on untreated molars at the same level of magnification. By observing changes in the enamel and pulp cavity, it was possible to determine whether third molars were immature until approximately 18 h immersed in acid. At 42 h, it was no longer possible to determine whether the molars were immature. However, they were still easily identifiable as human teeth. In situations where teeth may no longer be identifiable macroscopically, we found that the laminating and peeling features observed on high magnification SEM imagery can be useful in characterizing acid treatment even on very small fragments of dental remains, potentially allowing investigators to determine if acid was used as a disposal method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine

AB  - Objectives: The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods: Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results: Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions: Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Android has been a popular target for criminal actions due to its widespread use as a prominent mobile operating system, requiring the creation of sufficient security measures. Android has grown exposed to illegal activities due to its open-source design and ability to install third-party apps without centralized oversight. The suggested study thoroughly examines the rights that programs ask for to see whether there are any noticeable differences between the permissions used by malware samples and their benign equivalents. Based on complex authorization patterns, various machine learning methods are applied to distinguish between the two groups effectively. The discoveries spur the creation of solid security frameworks, eventually reducing the dangers of potential malware attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This article examines the success of religious social capital and the agency of teungku dayah (Islamic scholars who belong to traditional religious school) in the collective drug eradication movement in Ujong Pacu, Lhokseumawe-Aceh, Indonesia. The role of religious social capital in combating the drugs market in global drug policy has been less studied. This study provides a quite different view from most scholars who work for combating drug dealers by engaging participation of religious communities in rural society. The agency of teungku dayah succeeded in mobilizing the villagers due to the social capital that bonded the community based on religious ties. The article used live-in method, observation, in-depth and interviews to build a sociological imagination about the patterns of social practice of the people who become the subject of the research. The researchers lived in one of the villager's houses, participated in their discussions, listened to the gossip, worshipped with them and were involved in certain jobs carried out by the community members who targeted informants. Using religious social capital, this article argues that teungku dayah effectively used the social and religious capital of the Ujong Pacu community to conduct drug eradication. Religious social capital has strong ties in unifying elements of the people in the same religion, moreover it becomes an energy that keeps motivating the community to run anti-drugs movement and driving out the drug addicts in Ujong Pacu, Lhokseumawe-Aceh. © RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY 2020.

AB  - This paper discusses the impact of immigration policies on the ways young undocumented Sikh migrants in Paris negotiate their masculinity. The current criminalization of labor migration from the global South in Europe is disrupting long established patterns of upward mobility through international migration, that entailed remitting money home, getting married and reuniting with one’s family in the host country and moving up the socio-professional ladder from low-paid jobs to self employment. Instead, the life of an increasing number of Sikh migrants in France and elsewhere is marked by irregular status and socio-economic vulnerability. In this context, undocumented Sikh migrants try to assert their gender identity in multiple ways, characterized by homosociality, the importance of manual labor, specific forms of male sociability marked by the cultivation of their body, while remaining firmly grounded in a Sikh/Panjabi religious universe through seva (voluntary service) and gurdwara attendance. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Nowadays, 23% of the world population lives in multi-million cities. In these metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Seminal studies analyse crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large in a single city. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how violent and property crimes are related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods. To that end, we analyse crime at small areas and integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces to compare how the different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogotá, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another. Thus there is clearly no “one fits all” model. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the most effective treatment option for hemifacial spasm (HFS). However, deeply located forms of compression would require proper identification to allow for adequate decompression. OBJECTIVE: To describe the usefulness of endoscopic visualization in one of the most challenging compression patterns in HFS, where the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) loop is severely indenting the brain stem at the proximal root exit zone of facial nerve along the pontomedullary sulcus. METHODS: Radiological and operative data were checked for all patients in whom severe indentation of the brainstem by PICA at pontomedullary sulcus was recorded and endoscope-assisted MVD was performed. Clinical correlation and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients with HFS were identified with radiological and surgical evidence proving brainstem indentation at the VII transitional zone. In 31 patients, PICA was the offending vessel to the facial nerve. In 3 patients, the PICA loop was mobilized under visualization of a 45◦ endoscope. A total of 31 patients had a mean follow-up duration of 52.1 mo. The mean duration between start of complaints and surgery was 7.2 yr. In the last follow-up, all patients had remarkable spasm improvement. A total of 5 patients had more than 90% disappearance of spasms and 26 patients experienced spasm-free outcome. CONCLUSION: Although severe indentation of brain stem implies morphological damage, outcome after MVD is excellent. A 45◦ endoscope is extremely helpful to identify compression down at the pontomedullary sulcus. Deeply located compression site can easily be missed with microscopic inspection alone. © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021

AB  - The ability of modern smartphones to provide us with real time location-based data is one of its most important features. Being able to predict a person's future location based on the real time location data would be the next step in utilizing this functionality. Using this functionality, combined with machine learning one's probable destination can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy. People don't always use map-based navigation for the places they visit every day, like their work place or school and there may be significant traffic on the regular route taken, however, if our device knows where we're headed, it can warn us beforehand and help us reroute. This functionality can also be used by cops to determine the future location of a criminal fleeing a crime scene.These features and functionalities can be implemented through various machine learning algorithms which are compared to determine the most accurate one. The proposed system can predict a user's future location using the current location and time, learning from the user's previously visited locations. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders’ previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders’ knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location’s crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The offender’s journey to crime has attracted much attention in mobility triangle research, whereas the journey to victimization and the spatial distance between the offender’s and the victim’s residences have been relatively less examined. This research fills this gap in the literature by examining spatial comparisons of variations in journey to crime, journey to victimization, and the distance between victim’s and suspect’s residences for five types of offenses. Crime data from the Houston Police Department from 2010 to 2013 were used to analyze the mobility triangle in five types of crime. The results show that the dynamics of travel pattern vary by demographic characteristics of the suspects and victims. It is also contingent on the types of crime. The proximity of offender’s and victim’s residences is closely related to the chance of crimes. The findings provide important implications for theory, policy and policing practice. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Psychopathy is characterized by a lack of empathy, callousness, and a range of severe antisocial behaviors. A deficit to accurately process social cues, which has been widely documented in psychopathic populations, is assumed to underlie their pathological development. Impaired attention to socially salient cues, such as the eyes of an interaction partner, is a possible mechanism compromising the development of social cognition. Preliminary evidence from static facial stimuli suggests that psychopathy is indeed linked to reduced eye gaze. However, no study to date has investigated whether these mechanisms apply to naturalistic interactions. This study is the first to examine patterns of visual attention during live social interactions and their association with symptom clusters of psychopathy. Eye contact was assessed in a sample of incarcerated offenders (N = 30) during semistructured face-to-face interactions with a mobile eye-tracking headset and analyzed using a novel automated areas of interest (e.g., eye region) labeling technique. The interactions included an exchange on neutral predetermined topics and included a condition in which the participants were active (talking) and passive (listening). The data reveal that across both listening and talking conditions higher affective psychopathy is a significant predictor of reduced eye contact (listening: r = −.39; talking: r = −.43). The present findings are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy. This study is the first to document these deficits in naturalistic, live social interaction and therefore provides important evidence for their relevance to real-life behavior.

AB  - Motiveless homicides are usually defined as homicides in which a victim is killed by an offender and a motive was not determined by the police investigation. Motiveless does not mean that the police do not know the motive for the homicide, but rather that no other motive could accurately and objectively explain the reason for why the homicide occurred. However, this is especially problematic for the police because failing to establish a homicide motive is considered an investigative shortcoming. Due to the limited research conducted to date on motiveless homicides and the significant challenges they pose to investigators, the current study examines the geographic mobility patterns involved in these homicides. Using a sample of 194 solved cases of motiveless homicide from France, the criminal mobility triangle approach was used to explore their geographic patterns. Moreover, correlates of the entire criminal event were included for an in-depth understanding of these cases. The findings revealed various mobility patterns involved in motiveless homicides, combined with some specific correlates of the criminal event. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of the investigation of these crimes. © 2021, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.

AB  - This chapter addresses the ability of the criminological approaches that comprise Environmental Criminology to constitute an adequate theoretical framework to analyze and understand the situational aspects of crimes committed through cyberspace and to define the most appropriate prevention strategies. The chapter begins by examining how these approaches have been applied. Subsequently, the reasons why the environmental approach can offer much more in this area if some apparent obstacles are overcome are presented. Finally, a method of applying these midrange theoretical frameworks to different cybercrimes is proposed. Relying on multiple empirical studies, it is stated that the essential premise of the environmental approach is also observed in cybercrime: the existence of situational patterns. These patterns are derived from the different ways in which offenders and targets, in the absence of guardians, converge in cyber places: digital interaction environments that shape the situational opportunities in which people interact. The chapter ends by summarizing the application possibilities of approaches such as the Crime Pattern Theory and Situational Crime Prevention in connection with the Routine Activity Theory and the Rational Choice Theory. It is proposed that many of the geographical applications derived from these approaches and some of their basic theoretical premises need to be adapted while seeking to enhance their strengths and mitigate the effects of their weaknesses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Purpose: The teenager community is the most affected community by cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Increasing social networks and facilitating teenager access to the Internet have increased the probability of cybercrimes. On the other hand, entertainment such as mobile and computer games is top-rated among teenagers. Teenagers' tendency to cybercrime may be influenced by individual, parent, social, economic and political factors. Studying the impact of social networks, mobile games and parents' religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is the primary goal of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a considerable change in the world and the lifestyle of all people. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was also affected by the special conditions of this virus. Changes in ICT and rapid access to it have empowered individuals and organizations, and people have increased civic participation and interaction through ICT. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created new challenges for the government and citizens and may cause new crimes. Cybercrime is a type of crime that occurs in a cyber environment. These crimes range from invasions of privacy to crimes in which the offender vaguely paralyzes the macroeconomic. In this research, 265 students of high schools and universities are used for collecting data by utilizing a survey. Measuring actions have been done in all surveys employing a Likert scale. The causal pattern is assessed through a constructional equation modeling procedure to study the scheme's validity and reliability. Findings: The outcomes have indicated that social networks have no significant relationship with teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Mobile games have a mild effect on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era, and parents' religious attitudes significantly impact teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications: Current research also has some restrictions that must be noticed in assessing the outcomes. First, sample research was selected from high schools and universities in one city. So, the size of the model is small, and the generalization of results is limited. Second, this research may have ignored other variables that affect the tendency of teenagers' to cybercrime. Future researchers intend to investigate the parents' upbringing system's impact on teenager's trend to cybercrime in the COVID-19 era. Future research can also examine practical factors such as parental upbringing, attitudes toward technology development and virtual addiction in the COVID-19 era. Originality/value: In this study, teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era is investigated, and a procedure is applied depending on a practical occasion. This article's offered sample provides a perfect framework for influencing parents' social networks, mobile games and religious attitudes on teenagers' tendency to cybercrimes in the COVID-19 era. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - We conducted a small-area ecological longitudinal study to analyze neighborhood contextual influences on the spatio-temporal variations in intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) risk in a southern European city over an eight-year period. We used geocoded data of IPVAW cases with associated protection orders (n = 5867) in the city of Valencia, Spain (2011–2018). The city's 552 census block groups were used as the neighborhood units. Neighborhood-level covariates were: income, education, immigrant concentration, residential instability, alcohol outlet density, and criminality. We used a Bayesian autoregressive approach to spatio-temporal disease mapping. Neighborhoods with low levels of income and education and high levels of residential mobility and criminality had higher relative risk of IPVAW. Spatial patterns of high risk of IPVAW persisted over time during the eight-year period analyzed. Areas of stable low risk and with increasing or decreasing risk were also identified. Our findings link neighborhood disadvantage to the existence and persistence over time of spatial inequalities in IPVAW risk, showing that high risk of IPVAW can become chronic in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our analytic approach provides specific risk estimates at the small-area level that are informative for intervention purposes, and can be useful to assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts in reducing IPVAW. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The use of information technology is a cross-cutting actively developing element in the method of investigating mass riots, which in modern conditions acts as a factor in the success of this work. The article reveals the features of the criminal prosecution of riots using information technology. The main areas of using automated data banks and information retrieval systems in the investigation of mass riots are determined. Domestic and foreign possibilities of using information technologies in the organization of investigative work, in accounting and control over the materials of criminal cases on mass riots, in fixing the circumstances of crimes and in proving them are shown. The structure of the program for making and supporting the decision to create a specialized investigative group designed to work in emergency conditions is determined. As part of such a group, it is proposed to immediately organize its own information center with its own databank of episodes and persons, taking into account the primary materials on the facts of riots using the programs intended for this. For the formation of information about the general situation of mass riots, special mathematical models for the study of space-time patterns are intended. Recommendations are formulated to survey a large area and recreate a unified picture of disturbances using quadcopters. To determine the involvement of a person in riots, it is recommended to compare data from various electronic sources, such as email correspondence, electronic documents and mobile communication log files, the history of search queries in web browsers, cards and payment systems, etc. The modern judicial practice of proving participation in mass riots using, along with photo and video materials, the corresponding fragments of records also placed in electronic means is assessed. © 2021 Saint Petersburg State University.

AB  - This Special Issue is a collection of seven papers that seek to better our understanding of how urban mobility relates to crime patterns, and how day to day movement of people in urban spaces (urban mobility) is related to spatio-temporal patterns of crime. It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both ‘crime type’ appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the ‘dynamic denominator’ challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation. This special issue explores a range of potential solutions to this including mobile/cell phone data, transportation data, land use data, and other possible measures to address this. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In recent years, along with the development of the urban public transport system, bus pickpocketing crimes have garnered increasing attention. In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The current study investigates body disposal patterns in sexual homicide and examines whether offender’s behavior differ between solved and unsolved cases. To address these two research questions in line with rational choice perspective, a series of logistic regression analyses was conducted on a sample of 250 solved, and 100 unsolved sexual homicide cases in Canada. Within solved cases, results show that if victim is a prostitute, body found concealed, and found lying face down, it is likely the body was moved. For unsolved cases, the role of victim as a prostitute, and body recovered outdoors suggest that the body was moved. Further, results indicate that post-crime phase factors predicted the most whether the victim’s body was moved in solved cases. Whereas within unsolved cases, crime-phase factors contributed the most at predicting whether the body was moved post-homicide. Theoretical and practical implications from this study are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gait recognition, which is a biometric identifier for individual walking patterns, is utilized in many applications, such as criminal investigation and identification systems, because it can be applied at a long distance and requires no explicit cooperation of the subjects. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition, and several methods in previous studies have used depth information captured by RGB-D cameras. However, RGB-D cameras are limited in terms of their measurement distance and are difficult to access outdoors. In recent years, real-time multi-layer 3D LiDAR, which can obtain 3D range images of a target at ranges of over 100 m, has attracted significant attention for use in autonomous mobile robots, serving as eyes for obstacles detection and navigation. Compared with cameras, such 3D LiDAR has rarely been used for biometrics owing to its low spatial resolution. However, considering the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, such as the robustness of the illumination conditions, long measurement distances, and wide-angle scanning, the approach has the potential to be applied outdoors as a biometric identifier. The present paper describes a gait recognition system, called 2V-Gait, which is robust to variations in the walking direction of a subject and the distance measured from the 3D LiDAR. To improve the performance of gait recognition, we leverage the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, which are not included in regular cameras. Extensive experiments on our dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The criminal mobility of outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) members presents a significant challenge to Australian governments and police. Examining patterns of mobility can help to better understand the opportunity structures that underpin offending by OMCGs and to drive national collaborative responses to these gangs. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of criminal mobility in a sample of almost 4,000 OMCG members in more than 400 chapters. Around one in 10 members showed evidence of criminal mobility over the long term, while more than one-third of chapters comprised criminally mobile members. Criminally mobile gang members were heavily concentrated in a small number of chapters. Patterns of criminal mobility primarily involve movements into east coast jurisdictions. New South Wales and Queensland emerged as the most common destinations for criminally mobile OMCG members. © 2021 Australian Institute of Criminology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opportunity theories of crime are concerned with situational predictors of crime and include what Jacques and Wright refer to as the "theoretical siblings": Cornish and Clarke's rational choice perspective and Cohen and Felson's routine activity approach. Routine activity approach posits that crimes take place when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian intersect in space and time. Once presented with a crime opportunity, rational choice perspective suggests that an offender weighs the costs associated with engaging in crime against the potential benefits. Such "rational" decision-making is bounded by one's life circumstances and the available information. Super Mario Bros. is side-scrolling videogame and cultural phenomenon released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The central protagonist of the game, Mario is tasked with making his way through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from her captor, Bowser, King of the Koopa. Along the way, Mario collects coins and various power-ups, and must avoid pitfalls and eliminate enemies. Mario is motivated to collect such targets by his need to survive and complete his mission. Many targets are difficult to reach due to environmental hazards and game enemies serving as guardians over the desired rewards. This chapter provides an explanation of opportunity theory and several theoretical offshoots. Perspectives are applied to Super Mario Bros., and policy implications and empirical evidence of opportunity theories of crime are presented. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - Criminal opportunity theories are an emerging perspective used in place-based criminology to explain why certain locations have more crime than others. These theories suggest the confluence of social and physical characteristics of places can present the necessary "chemistry" for crime incidents to occur there. The Bachelor is a popular reality TV show where one individual gets to simultaneously date different contestants to explore potential relationships with the end goal of providing a marriage proposal to one contestant. This chapter uses criminal opportunity theories to present a framework to understand how the romantic chemistry for a relationship develops on The Bachelor. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article analyses the division of labour and patterns of elite reproduction that characterize international criminal justice as a market of services. Using a sociological framework and building on empirical data on 996 professional agents, the analysis outlines how the market in and around the international criminal courts is structured by three different social groups that dominate the formal roles of judges, prosecutors and defence counsel. The article investigates the relative positionality of these groups highlighting the low degree of mobility between them. It also demonstrates the reproduction of male, global north professionals at the top of these groups, pointing towards intersectional dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in this market. To deepen the analysis of divisions of labour and reproduction of status, the article turns to a closer analysis of the patterns of expertise upon which elite status is built and how it links the three groups to the wider market of international criminal justice. The relations between the identified social groups, the elite of which have very particular characteristics dominated by global north professionals, educations and networks, structure a core part of the market of international criminal justice and formats the social fault lines behind its normative debates.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new wave of innovations in forensics seeks to support criminal investigations by making inferences about the racial or ethnic appearance of as yet unknown suspects using genetic markers of phenotype or ancestry. This paper argues that to grasp fully the potentials of these innovations they must be understood both in the context of established patterns of police–minority relations and as part of significant changes in the use of ‘race’ as an object of knowledge in science, policy, and politics. Socio-technical developments offer new means of identification through geneticisation, datafication, and visualisation and heighten the visibility and valorisation of racial difference. Elements of this are already evident in existing national police forensic DNA databases whose operation, outcomes, and accompanying ethical frames are racialised in varied ways. By openly mobilising race and ethnicity, however, predictive techniques raise new questions about the validity, interpretation, dissemination, and application of results. Examination of existing use by the police and public of suspect descriptions shows the enduring power of common sense visual and linguistic understandings of race and appearance. That very power makes it hard to transition effectively from moments of collective stigmatisation to the identification of individual suspects. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Fake base station (FBS) has been exploited by criminals to attack mobile users by spamming fraudulent messages for over a decade. Despite that prior work has proposed several techniques to mitigate this issue, FBS spam is still a long-standing challenging issue in some countries, such as China, and causes billions of dollars of financial loss every year. Therefore, understanding and exploring the thematic strategies in the FBS spam ecosystem at a large scale would improve the defense mechanisms. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of FBS spam ecosystem by collecting three-month real-world FBS detection results. First, at "macro-level'', we uncover the characteristics of FBS spammers, including their business categories, temporal patterns and spatial patterns. Second, at "micro-level'', we investigate how FBS ecosystem is organized and how fraudulent messages are constructed by campaigns to trap users and evade detection. Collectively, the results expand our understanding of the FBS spam ecosystem and provide new insights into improved mitigation mechanisms for the security community. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The advancement in Information Technology permits high volume of data to be generated in databases of institutions, organizations, government, including Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). Technologies have also been developed to store and manipulate these data to enhance decision making. Crime remains a severe threat to humanity. Criminals currently, exploit highly sophisticated technologies to perform criminal activities. To effectively combat crime, LEAs must be adequately equipped with technological tools such as data mining technology to enable useful discoveries from databases. To achieve this, a Real-time Integrated Crime Information System (RICIS) was developed and mobile phones were used by informants (general public) to capture information about crimes being committed within Southern-East, Nigeria. Each crime information captured is being sent to the LEA responsible for the crime type and the information is stored in the agency database for data analysis. Thus, this study uses data mining algorithms to analyze crime trends and patterns in Southern-Eastern part of Nigeria between 2012 and 2013. The algorithms adopted were Classification and Rule Induction. The data set of 973 were collected from Eleme Police station, PortHarcourt (2012) and Nsukka Police station (2013). The analysis enables identifications of some trends of crimes and criminal activities from various LEAs databases, enhancing crime control and public safety. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Rapid advancement of digital technology has encouraged its use in all aspects of life, including the workplace, education, and leisure. As technology advances, so does the number of users, which leads to an increase in criminal activity and demand for a cyber-crime investigation. Mobile phones have been the epicenter of illegal activity in recent years. Sensitive information is transferred due to numerous technical applications available at one’s fingertips, which play an essential part in cyber-crime attacks in the mobile environment. Mobile forensic is a technique of recovering or retrieving digital evidence from mobile devices so that it may be submitted in court for legal procedures. As a result, mobile phone data is essential for obtaining evidence in elements of mobile forensic data ana-lysis. So, in this paper, we offer a method for detecting suspect drug-dealing patterns in mobile devices utilizing forensic and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Machine Learning algorithms are used to uncover the pattern in an original dataset, and performance measurements are used to assess the suggested system. In our approach, Logistic Regression (LR) manifests 95% of the highest accuracy in terms of count vector whereas, the BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) also achieved 95% of accuracy in terms of TFIDF. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

AB  - The present study sought to elucidate developmental patterns of perceived costs and rewards of offending and examine the relevance of this development for predicting offending in adulthood. The Pathways to Desistance data were used in analyses. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify latent patterns of development for both constructs. Negative binomial regression was used to test the relevance of differential development for predicting offending. A series of generalized estimation equations modeled age-graded changes in offending seriousness across the entire study period for each trajectory group identified in both models. Results indicated that a four-group model best fit the rewards data, while a three-group model best fit the costs data. Perceived rewards trajectory group membership significantly predicted offending in adulthood, with consistently elevated perception of rewards of offending found to be related to increased offending seriousness in adulthood. Differential development of perceived costs did not influence offending in adulthood. Consistently low and declining perceived rewards were associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to participants getting older. Increasing perceived costs of crime were similarly associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to age. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Smartphones as ubiquitous gadgets are rapidly becoming more intelligent and context-aware as sensing, networking, and processing capabilities advance. These devices provide users with a comprehensive platform to undertake activities such as socializing, communicating, sending and receiving e-mails, and storing and accessing personal data at any time and from any location. Nowadays, smartphones are used to store a multitude of private and sensitive data including bank account information, personal identifiers, account passwords and credit card information. Many users remain permanently signed in and, as a result, their mobile devices are vulnerable to security and privacy risks through assaults by criminals. Passcodes, PINs, pattern locks, facial verification, and fingerprint scans are all susceptible to various assaults including smudge attacks, side-channel attacks, and shoulder-surfing attacks. To solve these issues, this research introduces a new continuous authentication framework called DeepAuthen, which identifies smartphone users based on their physical activity patterns as measured by the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors on their smartphone. We conducted a series of tests on user authentication using several deep learning classifiers, including our proposed deep learning network termed DeepConvLSTM on the three benchmark datasets UCI-HAR, WISDM-HARB and HMOG. Results demonstrated that combining various motion sensor data obtained the highest accuracy and energy efficiency ratio (EER) values for binary classification. We also conducted a thorough examination of the continuous authentication outcomes, and the results supported the efficacy of our framework. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In recent years, simulation techniques have been applied to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of crime. Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with crime prevention strategies, and exploring crime prediction techniques, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents a simulation model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. The simulation generates patterns of individual mobility aiming to cumulatively match crime patterns. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure, location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as a proxy for human activity, and taxi trip data as a proxy for human movement between regions of the city. We analyze and systematically compare 35 different mobility strategies and demonstrate the benefits of using large-scale human activity data to simulate offender mobility. The strategies combining taxi trip data or historic crime data with popular activity nodes perform best compared to other strategies, especially for robbery. Our approach provides a basis for building agent-based crime simulations that infer offender mobility in urban areas from real-world data. © 2020 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article explores the intersection between paramilitary mobilization and nation-building in the area of Thesprotia in north-western Greece. It does so by examining the activities of the right-wing paramilitaries of EDES (Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Sindesmos – National Republican Greek League) between the Axis occupation and the early Cold War period. Studies of nation-building in twentieth-century Europe have adopted a state-centric approach. More recent scholarship has questioned this approach and presented a more nuanced picture of the nation-making process. A significant strand of this scholarship discusses the role of non-state armed actors–bandits, paramilitaries and criminal gangs–in this process. The present article contributes to this literature by focusing on an aspect of paramilitarism that has largely been overlooked in the existing scholarship: governance. The article discusses patterns of paramilitary governance and explores the impact of wartime rule in local institutions and civilian security, as well as the political legacies of paramilitarism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recent theoretical and methodological advances in urban sociology, including spatially located data, provide new opportunities to consider the joint influence of mobility and place in urban social life. This review defines the concept of activity space, describes its origins in urban sociology, and examines the extent to which activity space approaches advance sociological research in four substantive domains-spatial inequality and segregation, social connectedness and engagement, crime and offending patterns, and health and health-related behavior. It next describes the evolution of methods for location tracking and new approaches that hold promise for maximizing urban mobility and activity space contributions. It then discusses how location data may be augmented to enhance our sociological understanding of the structure, meaning, and implications of the places people visit or traverse in daily life. We close with new directions for activity space research, emphasizing how such work could enable comparative contextual research. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic “edges,” as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In forensic investigations it is often of value to establish whether two phones were used by the same person during a given time period. We present a method that uses time and location of cell tower registrations of mobile phones to assess the strength of evidence that any pair of phones were used by the same person. The method is transparent as it uses logistic regression to discriminate between the hypotheses of same and different user, and a standard kernel density estimation to quantify the weight of evidence in terms of a likelihood ratio. We further add to previous theoretical work by training and validating our method on real world data, paving the way for application in practice. The method shows good performance under different modeling choices and robustness under lower quantity or quality of data. We discuss practical usage in court. © 2019 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences

AB  - Ensuring women's safety in smart cities is a need of the hour. Even though several legal and technological steps are adopted worldwide, women's safety continues to be an international concern. Criminal records are maintained by law enforcement agencies and are most often not available to the public in an easily comprehensible form. While some wearable devices and mobile applications are available which are touted to aid in ensuring women's safety, they utilize limited societal intervention and are not very efficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. Most often the crime response, crime analysis, and crime prevention schemes are not integrated, leading to gaps in ensuring women's safety. Our major contribution is in developing a holistic system encompassing the three crucial aspects, i.e crime analysis and mapping, crime prevention, and emergency response by leveraging societal participation for women safety management. This work applies the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the identification of hotspots and patterns of crime. The proposed system uses data generated from the mobile application and/or wearable gadget prototyped as a part of this work along with the criminal history records for crime response, analysis, and prevention. The system for the hotspot identification is demonstrated for the Pilani town in the Jhunjhunu district in the state of Rajasthan, India, and can be easily scaled up geographically and utilized as a safety strategy for smart cities. While the common man is provided a cost-effective solution via the developed mobile application or wearable gadget, the various components are integrated into a website for supervisory management and can be utilized by law enforcement agencies.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A number of studies have revealed a correlation between bus stops and crimes, especially street robberies. However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article—based on a national data set (N = 173)—focuses on extrafamilial sexual homicides and their spatial mobility. The study combines the location of the crime scene and the offenders and victims’ residences in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the homicides fall within the categories of offender mobility and total mobility. Our results show the validity of the distance decay function, with over 70% of homicides occurring within 10 km of the offender’s residence. It appears that under certain circumstances, sexual murderers perceive their surroundings as a safe place to commit a homicide. Finally, the study proposes a four-category spatial typology of sexual homicide. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

AB  - In the last few decades, juvenile delinquency in the Republic of Bulgaria has begun to acquire new and specific characteristics. Inexplicable cases of violence are all too common in schools, families and public places. The article analyzes a small part of the theories of juvenile delinquency that exist in the global aspect, which are based on the understanding that criminal acts are determined by mental and behavioral processes at the individual level. According to the theory of rational choice, minors are motivated offenders who subordinate their behavior to a certain goal. Another group of views is defined as theories of biological and psychological traits. Antisocial manifestations are not so much due to the course of certain motivational processes in an individual's mental state, but primarily to the formation of individual patterns of behavior. The article aims to assist Bulgarian criminal law and criminology in clarifying the current circumstances in which juvenile delinquency develops, and the conclusion is that they do not differ significantly from those in the global context. The different perspectives on juvenile delinquency and the interdisciplinary nature of the problems are presented as objectively as possible. Such an approach can lead to a rethinking of the mechanisms and measures that should be applied to achieve the educational purpose of punishment. The analysis presented in the article also supports the introduction of alternative measures to punishment, as well as the achievement of better results in terms of resocialization of juvenile offenders. © St. Petersburg State University, 2021

AB  - The externalized European “migration management” in West Africa has technologically modernized and militarized border posts. This threatens visa-free travel, freedom of settlement and borderland economies in parts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It has interrupted historical mobility patterns, depleted the diversity of mobility practices and criminalized regional economies. At the same time, one can observe intensified and asymmetrical violent conflict in some of these borderlands. By taking the Kantchari-Makalondi borderland as a case study we analysed the relations between migration policies, insecurity, forced immobility and economic decline. Our observations and interviews with migrants, traders, security forces and borderlanders lead us to question conventional narratives on border control and African mobilities as a binary relation between Africa and Europe. Instead, they foreground the multiple practices of (im)mobility in these spaces: the circulation and blockage of travelers, merchandise, surveillance technologies, and military interventions and their impact on security and livelihoods. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crime prevention in society has persisted in being a significant issue that needs to be controlled through efficient investigation processes. Among these methods, biometric facial recognition is particularly effective because it is adaptable and non-intrusive. Face recognition has grown in popularity due to its numerous uses in entertainment, smart cards, information security, law enforcement, and surveillance. It is a vital topic in pattern recognition, computer vision, and image processing. For feature extraction, two basic methods are used: Appearance-based and model-based. Methods based on appearance employ global Face identification using representations. Model-based face approaches seek to create a human face model that captures facial diversity. The distance between the vectors of two photographs is defined as image similarity. This research primarily analyzed open-source Face Recognition algorithms based on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) model. The study will be of significant consideration in integrating Face Recognition technology on the current Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) using Minutiae Structure. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Psychoactive tryptamines are naturally found in toads, plants, and mushrooms. However, due to the hallucinogenic effect of tryptamine derivatives, they have been abused illegally by more and more users. The wide distribution of designer tryptamines has become a serious social problem, because they can cause serious damage to health and their psychotropic effects can lead to criminal activity. Some of tryptamines are controlled as narcotics under the Administration of Non-Pharmaceutical Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in China, such as 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DMT and so on. However, if they become controlled, new compounds with similar structures will then spread throughout the drug market. For known new psychoactive substances, mass spectra are compared with reference standards to identify the detected compounds. Nevertheless, in the case of such dynamic growth in the number of new substances on the drug market, the novel compound is often not already added to the spectra library. Without a reference standard, the compound must be identified from a detailed study of its mass spectra. Due to the limited applicability of spectral libraries, knowledge on fragmentation patterns of particular groups of new psychoactive substances is necessary to predict the structures of novel compounds. In 2015-2019, a series of eleven tryptamines were identified as new psychoactive substances in China. In this work, a fast and simple approach for the screening and identification of tryptamines was proposed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS). Compounds were analyzed on Aglient DB-5 MS column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm) with an initial temperature of 140 ℃ for gradient increased temperature by GC-MS and Acquity UPLC CSHTM C18 column (10 cm×2.1 mm×1.7 μm) with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A)-acetonitrile (B) as mobile phase for gradient elution by UPLC-QTOF MS. The fragmentation behaviors especially the MS fragmentation rules were compared and summarized. According to the structure and the typical fragmentations, these compounds can be easily identified. This method is fast and accurate, and can be used for analysising different types of tryptamines. So this work will be helpful to assist forensic laboratories in identifying these kinds of compounds or other substances with similar structure in their case work. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Chinese Mass Spectrometry Society.

AB  - Schools in America may provide opportunities for upward mobility while also perpetuating social inequality. The inequities found in the US public school system probably result in such a highly stratified society. Conditions found in many schools and classrooms are often a microcosm of the same conditions and factors present in the broader American society. Scholars and education reform activists often use the term school-to-prison pipeline to describe what they view as a widespread pattern in the United States of pushing students, especially those who are already at a disadvantage, out of school, and into the criminal justice system. This research explored whether mentorship in the lives of these very students can affect the trajectory that these students take in life by moving toward a pedagogy of liberation that challenges the inequities and contradictions in the institution of education. Building from a model similar to CDF Freedom Schools, but targeting academic enrichment, Farrah and her colleague Hope developed the Sankofa Project at Yin Elementary School (YES). Embracing both the social-emotional and pedagogical aspects of CDF Freedom Schools, the Sankofa Project moved from a mission that sought to instill a love for reading to actually teaching children to read. This aspect was pivotally important to Farrah and Hope as they sought to dismantle the “cradle to prison pipeline,” the concept of funneling masses of people into marginalized lives, imprisonment, and often premature death. Farrah believed that all her predecessors had done “was spot on, but academic enrichment was a key to steering children away from the pipeline.” With the rebirth of a caste-like system in America, black and brown bodies are disproportionately locked behind bars, relegated permanent second-class status if declared a felon and an increasingly common trend toward annihilation at the hands of those of who are designated to serve and protect them. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This paper analyzes crime reports and police activity in Rio de Janeiro during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate there was an overall drop in crime rates starting in April, especially in property crimes, which plummet to extremely unusual levels when compared with previous patterns. This pattern is most likely associated with an unprecedented decline in public mobility in some areas of the state. We show that the most significant reductions in street robberies occurred in neighborhoods where there was a greater decline in presence on the streets. Measures of police activity, in particular drug seizures and different types of arrests, dis-played a reduction comparable with the drop in criminal indicators. In contrast, the number of police killings followed a unique pattern: in April, immediately after the adoption of social distance measures, this indicator increased abo-ve the average from the previous four years; as of May, however, it assumed a downward trend, which turned into extraordinarily low levels in June. The extreme variation in the use of force by the police during the pandemic reinforces the documented dissonance between police lethality and criminal dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, shed-ding light on the mechanisms that regulate police violence in the state. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Communication surveillance, one of the main tools used in investigations of drug trafficking, is used to reconstruct criminal activity, identify the offenders, determine their respective roles within the trafficking operation, and eventually locate them. Research into the use of telephone data to study criminal groups currently relies mainly on transcripts of phone conversations obtained through police wiretapping. Our exploratory research also benefited from privileged access to telephone data from wiretaps and records of call details collected both in real time and retrospectively during investigations. Our research focuses on the relation between the roles of individuals involved in drug trafficking and the spatial patterns detected in telephone communications. We asked whether the role of a protagonist - his/her function and place within a trafficking group - can be inferred from telephone activities and addressed this question through a spatiotemporal analysis of call detail records and wiretaps from 20 individuals implicated in drug trafficking. The selected individuals could be classified into three different roles : Dealer, mid-level or high-level wholesaler, and cross-border or national courier. To determine their mobility, median locations, convex-hull areas, and the average distance travelled per day were calculated for each individual and by role type. The results support the hypothesis that individual roles influence the patterns found in telephone data. Couriers can be differentiated from dealers and wholesalers based on identifiable geographic patterns. Dealers can also be distinguished from wholesalers. These results confirm the proposed approach and reveal the potential of the analysis of telephone data to infer roles in drug trafficking. © 2020 Presses de l'Universite de Montreal.

AB  - Nowadays, mobile devices have become the natural substitute for the digital camera, as they capture everyday situations easily and quickly, encouraging users to express themselves through images and videos. These videos can be shared across different platforms exposing them to any kind of intentional manipulation by criminals who are aware of the weaknesses of forensic techniques to accuse an innocent person or exonerate a guilty person in a judicial process. Commonly, manufacturers do not comply 100% with the specifications of the standards for the creation of videos. Also, videos shared on social networks, and instant messaging applications go through filtering and compression processes to reduce their size, facilitate their transfer, and optimize storage on their platforms. The omission of specifications and results of transformations carried out by the platforms embed a features pattern in the multimedia container of the videos. These patterns make it possible to distinguish the brand of the device that generated the video, social network, and instant messaging application that was used for the transfer. Research in recent years has focused on the analysis of AVI containers and tiny video datasets. This work presents a novel technique to detect possible attacks against MP4, MOV, and 3GP format videos that affect their integrity and authenticity. The method is based on the analysis of the structure of video containers generated by mobile devices and their behavior when shared through social networks, instant messaging applications, or manipulated by editing programs. The objectives of the proposal are to verify the integrity of videos, identify the source of acquisition and distinguish between original and manipulated videos. © 2020

AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) is a relatively new mobility classification task in which anonymous trajectories are linked to the users who generated them. With applications ranging from personalized recommendations to criminal activity detection, TUL has received increasing attention over the past five years. While research has focused mainly on learning deep representations that capture complex spatio-temporal mobility patterns unique to individual users, we demonstrate that visit patterns are highly unique among users and thus simple heuristics applied directly to the raw data are sufficient to solve TUL. More specifically, we demonstrate that a single check-in per trajectory is enough to correctly predict the identity of the user up to 85% of the time. Moreover, by using a non-parametric classifier, we scale up TUL to over 100k users which is an increase over state-of-theart by three orders of magnitude. Extensive empirical analysis on four real-world datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare, Gowalla and Weeplaces) compares our findings to state-of-the-art results, and more importantly validates our claim that TUL is easier than commonly believed. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The study of the impact of modern technologies and, in particular, digitalization on the transformation and future development of industries, as well as changes in economic models both within the industry itself and at the level of one state, and in interstate economic relations, is one of the new areas of research in the global economy originating from the very nascent phenomenon. The object of this study is the automotive industry. However, the changing processes presented in this article affect many other industries. Digitalization will require not only new strategies from manufacturers trying to gain competitive advantages, but also a state that is responding to new reality to protect personal data and personal space of citizens. In this sample-structured document, neither the cross-linking of float elements and bibliography nor metadata/copyright information is available. The sample document is provided in "Draft"mode and to view it in the final layout format, applying the required template is essential with some standard steps. These steps, which should require generation of the final output from the styled paper, are mentioned here in this paragraph. First, users have to run "Reference Numbering"from the "Reference Elements"menu; this is the first step to start the bibliography marking (it should be clicked while keeping the cursor at the beginning of the reference list). After the marking is complete, the reference element runs all the options under the "Cross Linking"menu. The authors base their research on consistent patterns characterizing the dependence of industrial development on the general economic situation. To analyze the processes occurring in industries under the influence of new technologies, a comparative analysis of the research materials of international research companies, world economic communities and advanced technological auto giants is carried out. The approaches used in the research include a prognostic analysis of the behavior of market entities under the influence of new digital technologies. Digital transformation is changing the traditional business model and value chain. The emerging trends are personalization of services and individual customer interaction solutions: Omnichannel pre-sales engagement, customized driving experience, targeted mobility, IoT integration, car dealerships, personalized insurance, personalized data insurance, car sharing customer profiles, etc. As the industry moves from the simple production of an automobile to the creation of an intelligent, connected digital transport hub, companies need to adapt to the value chain and life cycle of the client, not the car. Connected cars will be a continuation and expression of the individuality and style of the client, like the revolution of mobile phones. Digital transformation in the automotive industry will bring positive transformations for both consumers and society as a whole, affecting the environment at the same time and creating new jobs, which, of course, should attract attention and be supported by the state as a regulatory body. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - A natural or human-caused ‘disaster’ usually is a vast area where massive and diverse evidences must be located, collected and transferred for analysis to a distant reference laboratory. Every single detail may be crucial for the identification of the causes and/or the criminal action of groups responsible of a potential risk caused by improvised chemical, biological and explosive devices. Nevertheless, the main difficulty is to determine which kind of evidence to look for. A detailed knowledge of similar events/contamination process could be helpful results of a threat analysis (prediction) will be useful (preparation of the plot, logistics, targeting, action, post-action steps-prevention). Cooperative multi-robot systems based on UAV and UGV equipped with modular sensors and intervention tools (detection, measurements) will carry out the screening, searching and collection of samples in the “hot zones” where the first responders could be exposed to dangerous and hazardous agents. Artificial intelligence techniques applied to the acquired data will contribute to improve detection and classification of evidentiary material and discrimination of mixed evidence, all of them critical for forensic investigations. Data fusion and artificial intelligent techniques will also be applied for predicting the dispersion patterns of some biological agents, providing in this way, a useful decision making tool for first-responders. © CLAWAR Association Ltd.

AB  - Water short circuiting leading to early, sudden and massive water breakthroughs in producer wells has been a lingering concern to oil operators for many years. Unfavorable mobility ratio leading to viscous fingering, horizontal wells exhibiting 'the heel-toe effect' and fields with fracture-fault activities are more prone to these kinds of unwanted water breakthroughs, suffering from oil production losses and higher operational cost for management of the excessive produced water. A brown field in the south of the Sultanate of Oman was experiencing massive water short circuiting within two of its patterns. [MJO1]While conformance was well established and dynamically confirmed through production performance and artificial lift parameters in most patterns within the field, the complicated inverted nine spot injector-producer pattern scenario[MJO2] was making it difficult to ascertain the offending injectors or unexpected flow paths leading to the condition within the study area. The lower API oil and slightly fractured and faulted geology was exhibiting conditions for injection imbalance and the challenge was to bring the high water-cut wells back to full potential and increase oil output whilst reducing water flow. To investigate the breakthrough occurrences and mitigate the challenge, chemical water tracers were introduced in the reservoir as a part of Integrated Reservoir Management framework to identify flow directions and offending injectors. The Phase-1 of the two-phase study, discussed in this paper, was carried out to determine reservoir conformance that was contributing to short circuiting and once the cause was identified and treated, Phase-2 was carried out post well intervention to validate the success of the treatment. Phase-1 of the tracer study was initiated in October 2019 where two injectors and nineteen producers across two adjacent patterns were traced with two unique chemical water tracers. Massive tracer responses were obtained within the first few days in few wells, directly pointing out towards the offending injector(s). Sampling and analysis for Phase-1 was continued for about six months, after which, a zonal isolation was carried out in one the identified injectors in August 2020. Cement was pumped across all the perforation intervals and a new perforation was performed across the top and bottom of the reservoir avoiding the middle intervals that were taking about 70% of injection as per production logging. Phase-2 of the study was initiated in March 2021 and continued sampling and analyses are still being carried out. With about 15% reduction in water cut and a three-fold increase in oil rate at the target producer, the study validated that an integrated knowledge of reservoir geology and production behavior coupled with tracer studies was a very successful strategy for managing short circuiting in waterflood reservoirs. The study showed that this sequence and combination of methods can be useful in effective treatment for wells experiencing high water cut across the world. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

AB  - In today’s modern world, mobile has turned out to be one of the essentials for all the people irrespective of their status and profession. With the help of this device, all the data about a person can be tracked down (i.e. from the diet, diseases to contacts and transactions). In case of criminal investigations, inspectors need to collect information about a victim or accused. For this, the individual’s mobile phone plays a vital role. However, it is very difficult to access a device without its owner’s permission. Suppose, if the victim is dead or not willing to expose the information, the cyber police should perform many complex tasks to retrieve the data. Thus, there is a great need to analyze this task and make it feasible to find out pass-codes in order to access the mobile device. This paper explains how passwords can be cracked with ease with the help of survey and training of large dataset. We all know that people these days are very active on social media, which makes it easy to track them. In this work, we analyze a few passcodes and patterns and try to test that data by giving the queries. Here, we can analyze and retrieve the data from an individual’s social media such as date of birth, name, personal information and try to predict the passcode in very few attempts as it turns out that majority of the time, the passcode is generally predictable based on some key characteristics identified in this paper. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Micromobility aims to provide environmentally friendly options for trips that cannot be accomplished with public transport and reduce automobile dependence. The most recent transport mode for accomplishing such trips is the electric scooter (e-scooter) and they have flooded several countries and cities taking a significant share of trips. However, there is little guidance regarding their operations and initial observations demonstrate public disdain. This article deals with the evaluation of the public opinion in regard to e-scooters based on those who do not use them. To solicit input, an in-person and an electronic questionnaire were used in Thessaloniki, Greece. Statistical analysis of the collected data was undertaken to establish possible pattern of public opinion and identify situations of e-scooters that cause problems in pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic. Furthermore, the lack of infrastructure, which is a deterrent to e-scooter use, and the absence of a legislative framework that sets out the rules for traffic seem to be main concerns. Finally, the surveys noted that e-scooters will be promoted and integrated into traffic by designing and building adequate infrastructure, training users in Highway Code and imposing fines on offenders. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objectives: Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us? Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets. Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper inspects changes in crime trends brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu, India. Using Bayesian structural time-series models, the authors study the changes in two metrics of criminal activity–crime registration and distress calls. In addition to absolute changes, the authors analyse the relative changes in one metric with respect to the other during two stay-at-home orders across six categories of crimes: property offences; offences against the human body; cases of missing persons and unidentified dead bodies; vehicle- and traffic-related offences; crimes against women, children and elders; and emerging crimes. While there was an overall decrease in most types of crime, results show that each category was impacted by restrictions in human mobility in different ways; emerging crimes, in particular, increased significantly during both periods. The crime and call trends exhibited a synchronous pattern with respect to a majority of offences except in the category of crimes against women and missing persons, where a contrary trend of decreasing crime registrations and increasing distress calls was noticed during the partial lockdown period. This finding highlights inherent inadequacies such as under-reporting of crimes by victims and non-registration of crime by the police. Understanding these inadequacies could potentially enhance preparedness leading to improved public service delivery by reordering priorities. Breaking down these trends at a crime-specific level assists law enforcement practitioners in gaining insights on crime motivators and enablers, thus contributing towards more effective crime prevention under ordinary circumstances. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Understanding offender motivation is key to developing effective crime reduction policies. Criminological theories seeking to explain offender motivations are plentiful—some argue for a pure utilitarian agenda driven by opportunity (rational choice), others for the influence of socially constructed standards of behavior (strain, learning), and still others argue for accounting for multiple layers of influence (crime pattern theory). Though these theories have been used to explain the presence of antiquities looting, few have sought to examine offender motivations specifically due to a lack of data. But what kind of data should those interested in offender motivations be looking for? How does this align with possible underlying theoretical motivations? This study speaks to these questions by first considering how criminological theoretical paradigms account for antiquities looter motivations. Then, it traces how to approach examining looting motivation by identifying the types of evidence and data needed to test theoretical predictions and which methodologies would be appropriate for such an analysis. Finally, this study demonstrates this approach using case study featuring a newly collected spatiotemporal dataset on antiquities looting in Egypt. Looking from 2015 to 2017, this study will determine what can be learned about possible offender motivations in Egypt at this time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Today traditional communication methods, such as SMS or phone calls, are used less often and are replaced by the use of chat applications. WhatsApp is one of the most popular chat applications nowadays. WhatsApp offers different ways of communicating, which include sending text messages and making phone calls. The implementation of encryption makes WhatsApp more challenging for law enforcement agencies to identify when a suspect is sending or receiving messages via this chat application. Most research in literature focused on the analysis of WhatsApp data by obtaining information from a physical device, such as a seized mobile device. However, it is not always possible to extract the data needed from a mobile device for the analysis of the WhatsApp data because of the encryption, or no devices have been seized yet. In addition, the current techniques for real time analysis of WhatsApp messages show that there is a high risk of detection by the suspect. Alternative methods are needed to understand the communication patterns of a suspect and criminal organizations. In this paper, we focused on identifying when a suspect is receiving or sending WhatsApp messages using only wiretap data. Therefore, no seized devices are needed. The pattern analysis has been used to identify patterns of data sent to and received from the WhatsApp servers. The identified patterns were tested against a large dataset created with different mobile devices to determine if the patterns are consistent. By using the technique described in this paper, investigators will obtain more information if and with whom a suspect is communicating. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Spatial characteristics of community resident's occupational structure is a classic topic in social geography studies. However, it is still an under-explored topic to examine the impact of community residents' occupational structure on the spatial pattern of different types of crimes. Taking a large city in South China as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of different types of occupational residents on the crimes of burglary, pickpocketing and assault by establishing spatial lag negative binomial regression models. Our study shows that different occupational groups have different social characteristics and socioeconomic status, and so do their different impacts on various criminal activities. The specific conclusions are as follows: 1) the person in charge of the unit has no significant influence on these three types of crimes; 2) professional skill workers have a significant positive impact on pickpocketing and assault; 3) clerks, business and service people and primary industry personnel have significant positive impacts on burglary; and 4) the distribution of personnel in the primary industry nearby will inhibit burglary, pickpocketing and assault. This study further explained the results in combination with the ‘costs, benefits and risks’ of rational choice theory. The conclusions may be of great reference value for community police strategies. © 2021

AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers’ crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers’ crime location choices, but not native robbers’. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In the South Asian setting, the fields of gender history and family history are still predominantly concerned with relatively elite social groups. Few studies have examined issues of gender and the family in the history of Dalit, low-caste, and socially marginalized communities, especially those that were labelled 'criminal tribes' from the mid-nineteenth century on. This article explores the ways in which gender patterned criminalized communities' experiences of everyday colonial governance under Part I of the 1871 Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) in the first two decades that it was enforced in northern India. In this early period, the colonial government did not closely regulate marriage practices, domestic arrangements, or the gendered organization of labour within communities categorized as 'criminal tribes'. Nevertheless, notions of sexuality and gender underlay colonial knowledge of the 'criminal tribes', which emerged in dialogue with middle-class Indian gender and caste politics. Moreover, the family unit was the central target of the CTA surveillance and policing regime, which aimed to produce 'industrious' families. Officially endorsed forms of labour had complex implications for criminalized communities in the context of North Indian gender norms and strategies of social mobility. Gender power dynamics also shaped criminalized peoples' interpersonal, embodied interactions with British and Indian colonial officials on an everyday basis. Meanwhile, different forms of leverage and evasion were open to men and women to cope with their criminalization and so the colonial state was experienced in highly gendered ways. © Cambridge University Press 2020

AB  - Identifying an unfamiliar caller's profession is important to protect citizens' personal safety and property. Due to limited data protection of many popular online services in some countries such as taxi hailing or takeouts ordering, many users encounter an increasing number of phone calls from strangers. This may aggravate the situation that criminals pretend to be delivery staff or taxi drivers, bringing threats to the society. Additionally, many people nowadays suffer from excessive digital marketing and fraud phone calls because of personal information leakage. However, previous works on malicious call detection only focused on binary classification, and do not work for identification of multiple professions. We observed that web service requests issued from users' mobile phones which may show their Apps preferences, spatial and temporal patterns, and other profession related information. This offers us a hint to identify unfamiliar callers. In fact, some previous works already leveraged raw data from mobile phones (which includes sensitive information) for personality studies. However, accessing users' mobile phone raw data may violate the more and more strict private data protection policies or regulations (e.g. GDPR 71). Using appropriate statistical methods to eliminate private information and preserve personal characteristics, provides a way to identify mobile phone callers without privacy concern. In this paper, we exploit privacy-preserving mobile data to develop a model which can automatically identify the callers who are divided into four categories of users: normal users (other professions), taxi drivers, delivery and takeouts staffs, telemarketers and fraudsters. The validation results over an anonymized dataset of 1, 282 users with a period of 3 months in Shanghai City prove that the proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 75+%. © 2020 IEEE.

Through a politics and practice of ‘earwitnessing detention’, this article explores experiential patterns and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By ‘tuning in’ to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of ‘indefinite stuckness’. Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity for respite from the ‘chaos’ outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies indefinite stuckness. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This article examines the predictions of crime pattern theory in a unique neighborhood type. It tested potential crime attracting facilities against street robbery data from 2009 to 2013 in the Police Districts I & II in Downtown Houston. The analysis modeled the four daily human routine periods described in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Generalized linear simultaneous negative binomial regression model was used to determine the size of the influence of the variables (beta coefficients) and their significance for each model outcome. The findings show some distinct patterns of street robbery due to the immediate and lagged effects of the variables relatable to the study environment’s unique setting. Two variables, geographic mobility, and barbershops were particularly significant across three of the outcome models. The results suggest that the physical and social structure of neighborhoods determined by land-use regulations would enhance understanding of the time-based influence on robbery patterns due to crime-attracting facilities. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objectives: Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods: We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results: The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion: Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) refers to classifying trajectories into the corresponding generated users and has emerged as an essential spatio-temporal data mining task with a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from personalized location recommendation and trip planning to criminal behavior detection and object tracking. Despite the progress made by recent deep learning-based human mobility learning models, some critical factors related to personal context and user-location interactions have not yet been fully explored. Besides, existing works suffer from high computational cost issues due to the increased complexity of trajectory learning and contextual location embedding. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end model called GNNTUL, composed of a graph neural network (GNN) module and a classifier, to effectively and efficiently learn human mobility and associate the traces to the users in online social networks. GNNTUL is the first GNN-based human mobility learning model exploiting implicit transition patterns behind sparse user traces in online social networks while extracting users' unique motion features and discriminating the motion traces. Extensive experiments conducted on two real- world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNNTUL over several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both linking accuracy and learning efficiency. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Interpersonal crimes such as aggravated assault greatly impacts upon an individuals’ sense of personal safety and security as the crime results in a physical injury. Understanding where and when aggravated assaults are most likely to occur is therefore vital to minimize the victimization risk associated with this crime. The main aim of this study is to explore the relative importance of space and time in aggravated assault victimization. This was done using national level aggravated assault data (2008-2010) obtained from New Zealand Police and census data from Statistics New Zealand. Both the spatial and temporal distribution of aggravated assault are outlined to examine their association with aggravated assault victimization. Aggravated assault is found to cluster in space but not in time. The relationships between aggravated assault risk in space and time and a suite of social, economic, and lifestyle variables was then examined. A clear socioeconomic gradient was found between aggravated assault risk by space and all neighborhood characteristics with high-risk neighborhoods having greater residential mobility and ethnic/racial diversity, as well as being more deprived, having higher rates of unemployment, and lower median household incomes. No clear pattern emerged between aggravated assault by time and the selected neighborhood characteristics. The policy implications of these findings in terms of policing and diversity conclude. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Spatio-temporal sequential pattern mining (STSPM) plays an important role in many applications such as mobile health, criminology, social media, solar events, transportation, etc. Most of the current studies assume the data is located in a centralized database on which a single machine performs mining. Thus, the existing centralized algorithms are not suitable for the big data environment, where data cannot be handled by a single machine. In this paper, our main aim is to find out the Spatio-temporal sequential patterns from the event data set using a distributed framework suitable for mining big data. We proposed two distributed algorithms, namely, MR-STBFM (MapReduce based spatio-temporal breadth first miner), and MR-SPTreeSTBFM (MapReduce based sequential pattern tree spatio-temporal breadth first miner). These are the distributed algorithms for mining spatio-temporal sequential patterns using Hadoop MapReduce framework. A spatio-temporal tree structure is used in MR-SPTreeSTBFM for reducing the candidate generation cost. This is an extension to the proposed MR-STBFM algorithm. The tree structure significantly improves the performance of the proposed approach. Also, the top-most significant pattern approach has been proposed to mine the top-most significant sequential patterns. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on the Boston crime dataset. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The daily rhythms of the city, the ebb and flow of people undertaking routines activities, inform the spatial and temporal patterning of crime. Being able to capture citizen mobility and delineate a crime-specific population denominator is a vital prerequisite of the endeavour to both explain and address crime. This paper introduces the concept of an exposed population-at-risk, defined as the mix of residents and non-residents who may play an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in a specific crime type, present in a spatial unit at a given time. This definition is deployed to determine the exposed population-at-risk for violent crime, associated with the night-time economy, in public spaces. Through integrating census data with mobile phone data and utilising fine-grained temporal and spatial violent crime data, the paper demonstrates the value of deploying an exposed (over an ambient) population-at-risk denominator to determine violent crime in public space hotspots on Saturday nights in Greater Manchester (UK). In doing so, the paper illuminates that as violent crime in public space rises, over the course of a Saturday evening, the exposed population-at-risk falls, implying a shifting propensity of the exposed population-at-risk to perform active roles as offenders, victims and/or guardians. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and policy relevance of these findings. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars’ choice of residence to burglarize. Methods: We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars’ target choice in a conditional logit model. Results: Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions: Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars’ target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Using personal trajectory information to grasp the spatiotemporal laws of dangerous activities to curb the occurrence of criminal acts is a new opportunity and method for security prevention and control. This paper proposes a novel method to discover abnormal behaviors and judge abnormal behavior patterns using mobility trajectory data. Abnormal behavior trajectory refers to the behavior trajectory whose temporal and spatial characteristics are different from normal behavior, and it is an important clue to discover dangerous behavior. Abnormal patterns are the behavior patterns summarized based on the regular characteristics of criminals’ activities, including wandering, scouting, random walk, and trailing. This paper examines the abnormal behavior patterns based on mobility trajectories. A Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)-based method is used to extract personal trajectory features, and the K-means clustering method is applied to extract abnormal trajectories from the trajectory dataset. Based on the characteristics of different abnormal behaviors, the spatio-temporal feature matching method is used to identify the abnormal patterns based on the filtered abnormal trajectories. Experimental results showed that the trajectory-based abnormal behavior discovery method can realize a rapid discovery of abnormal trajectories and effective judgment of abnormal behavior patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The article presents a characterization of criminal mobility and modus operandi of rape crimes that occurred in the city of Maceió (AL, Brazil) between the years 2015 and 2017. The data gathered in the study were provided by the Civil and Military Police and by the Alagoas State Re-socialization and Social Inclusion Secretariat. A descriptive approach was used to describe the configurational aspects of rapes reported in the city in the period mentioned above. In the analysis of the results, it was possible to identify patterns in the way in which the aggressors acted, in the profiles of the victim and of the offender and in the spatiotemporal configurations of rape crimes on the urban perimeter of the capital of Alagoas State. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Enforcing law and order has always been a challenge for law enforcement agencies. Exponential growth and unconditional access to Internet and mobile computing have added to this. It is in this context that police forces around the world are migrating to predictive policing. This move will aid them in informed decision-making leading to better enforcement of law and order. Using machine learning algorithms, law enforcement agencies can now extract specific patterns of crime and criminal behaviour from spatio-temporal data to determine whether a freshly committed crime relates to an existing pattern or not. With this knowledge, the administrators would be better equipped to map crime to criminals. Further, they can use the data for forecasting, which, in turn, will enable them to deploy resources judiciously. This can even aid in prevention of crimes or help efficient tackling of crimes. In this chapter, the authors investigate popular algorithms for finding patterns from large datasets and thus elucidating various machine learning approaches in crime analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, particularly those who have experienced criminal justice involvement, have particularly high HIV burdens, and a majority of those in jail have substance use disorders (SUDs). MSM and transgender women also experience elevated rates of incarceration. Once community re-entry occurs, individuals are in a critical period for addressing potential risks of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition and negative sequelae of substance use. Further, the impact experienced by one's social and sexual networks experienced at the time of detention and release have important health implications for MSM and transgender women. Objective: The purpose of this study is to test a new intervention-Mobile-Enhanced Prevention Support (MEPS)-that involves a GPS-based mobile app called GeoPassport (referred to as GeoPass in practice), incentives, and peer support for promoting HIV prevention, substance use treatment, and use of related services. Methods: A two-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled trial will seek to enroll 300 HIV-negative MSM and transgender women, aged 18-49 years, with SUDs, who are either in jail or have recently left jail. Participants will be enrolled by study staff and randomized to the MEPS intervention group or usual care group. The intervention group will receive customized wellness goals in addition to GeoPass, cash incentives, and the support of a trained peer mentor for 6 months. Data collection will consist of a baseline survey and three follow-up surveys at 3, 6, and 9 months postenrollment, either in person or by phone or videoconference when necessary. The primary outcomes include establishing a primary care provider; being prescribed and adhering to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV; screening for HIV, STIs, and hepatitis C virus; and engagement in recommended treatment for SUDs. Secondary outcomes include obtaining treatment for any identified infections and avoiding recidivism. Results: Enrollment began in November 2019 and study completion is expected in 2023. Conclusions: This study will advance our knowledge base on patient navigation and peer mentor interventions. Peer navigation services have been studied for the treatment of HIV, but less often in the context of HIV and STI prevention among sexual and gender minority populations at the time of re-entry into the community from jail. The MEPS study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of combining peer mentor services with a mobile app to facilitate service utilization and participant-peer mentor communication. MEPS will assess patterns of PrEP uptake and utilization in MSM and transgender women leaving jail. The study will provide heretofore unavailable data from persons leaving jail regarding HIV PrEP, STI screening, substance abuse treatment, and service utilization patterns and experiences, including geocoded data for those in the intervention arm. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Image retrieval of tire tread pattern plays a vital role in traffic accidents and criminal investigation. We propose a tire pattern retrieval method based on wavelet transform and Siamese network, which combine traditional techniques with deep learning. Firstly, we use the wavelet transform to extract low-level features of tire patterns. Secondly, we design a lightweight network called TireNet to extract high-level features of tire patterns. The TireNet based on MobileNet V1 replace the single convolutional neural network of the original Siamese network. Finally, the low-level and high-level features are fused to generate a one-dimensional vector, and calculated the similarity by Euclidean distance. To verify the proposed method in this article, we construct a tire pattern dataset named TireDataset. The experimental results show that the Siamese network is feasible in the task of learning the similarity of tire patterns, and TireNet outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy trade-off. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Face recognition describes a surface framework, which is capable of processing image and detection. The proposed paper demonstrates three contributions: the first is to introduce the image representation, known as an integral image, the second application of Ada Boost learning algorithm, and the third is the cascaded framework. This includes observation, bio-metrics and video coding. Here, the primary objective is to implement a real-time system using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to track and detect human expression. The expression recognition involves colour-shaped coating separation and image purifying. Moreover, it involves different types of search engines which are based on computer vision. A computer controls Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) cameras in CCTV for surveillance systems for the face. The multi-view face tracking on a mobile platform has three methods (local binary patterns) and enhancing procedure. These face detectors are adaptable, extended for multi-opinion face recognition over the revolution ability and face matrix partition scheme is proposed to accelerate the face tracking process. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Trajectory-User Linking (TUL), which links trajectories to users, is a recently introduced trajectory mining task with a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from personalized recommendation systems and location-based social networks to potential criminals identification. Previous approaches on solving the TUL task generally rely on classic models or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. However, their prediction accuracy is always not satisfactory due to the following reasons: 1) trajectory data is low-sampling and sparse; 2) user mobility patterns are high-order and multi-periodic; and 3) previous approaches fail to utilize existing abundant features. In this paper, we propose DeepTUL, which is composed of a feature representation layer and a recurrent network with attention mechanism, to solve TUL task. DeepTUL not only combines multiple features that govern user mobility to model high-order and complex mobility patterns, but also learns from labeled historical trajectory to capture multi-periodic nature of user mobility and alleviate the data sparsity problem. Extensive experiments show that DeepTUL yields significant improvements over the existing methods on two types of real-life mobility datasets (i.e., check-in dataset and WLAN dataset). Moreover, DeepTUL provides intuitive interpretation into the trajectory-user linking. © 2020 International Foundation for Autonomous.

AB  - Introduction: Road Traffic Accident (RTA), in this era of urbanization, have emerged as a global health hazard because of the morbidity and mortality associated with them. In an RTA, often the thoracic injuries go unnoticed and are overlooked because of the resilient nature of the thoracic wall, which leads to the late detection of injuries and their fatal outcomes. Aim of the study: To evaluate the pattern of thoracic injuries in RTA and to find out the epidemiological parameters involved in RTA. Materials and Methods: In this autopsy based cross-sectional study, 85 victims of fatal RTA were studied between 1st July 2019 to 31st December 2020 in the mortuary of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. All the fatal RTA cases coming for autopsy were included in the study except decomposed and mutilated cases. Result: In this study, male two-wheeler drivers, belonging to the age group 21-40 years were most vulnerable to RTAs. Maximum number of RTAs were reported during Winter season. Inter-city roads witnessed majority of the RTAs and two-wheelers were the most common offending agent. Most of the RTAs occurred during late evening i.e., 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Forty-three victims had chest injury after a RTA. Abrasion was the most common external chest injury followed by contusion. Fracture of thoracic skeleton was the major internal chest injury followed by chest wall contusion and injury to vital intrathoracic organ. 58 % of the victims, who had chest injury, had a fractured rib. 37 % of the RTA victims had collection in the pleural cavity either in the form of Hemothorax or Pneumothorax. Lung was the most common vital intrathoracic organ to be injured in RTA. Head injury was the most common cause of death followed by hemorrhage and shock. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of increasing road safety awareness, strictly enforcing traffic rules, establishing an advanced trauma response system, and providing well-equipped mobile ambulatory service to reduce the morbidity and mortality resulting from road traffic accidents. © 2022, Institute of Medico-legal Publication.

AB  - In the spatial analysis of crime, the residential population has been a conventional measure of the population at risk. Recent studies suggest that the ambient population is a useful alternative measure of the population at risk that can better capture the activity patterns of a population. However, current studies are limited by the availability of high precision demographic characteristics, such as social activities and the origins of residents. In this research, we use spatially referenced mobile phone data to measure the size and activity patterns of various types of ambient population, and further investigate the link between urban larceny-theft and population with multiple demographic and activity characteristics. A series of crime attractors, generators, and detractors are also considered in the analysis to account for the spatial variation of crime opportunities. The major findings based on a negative binomial model are three-fold. (1) The size of the non-local population and people's social regularity calculated from mobile phone big data significantly correlate with the spatial variation of larceny-theft. (2) Crime attractors, generators, and detractors, measured by five types of Points of Interest (POIs), significantly depict the criminality of places and impact opportunities for crime. (3) Higher levels of nighttime light are associated with increased levels of larceny-theft. The results have practical implications for linking the ambient population to crime, and the insights are informative for several theories of crime and crime prevention efforts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Explaining how offenders choose a crime location is one of the central themes of crime geography. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice mostly considers the impact of the built environment and social environment, without considering the impact of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery and its temporal difference. To fill this gap, this study integrated ambient population and surveillance cameras in assessing street robbers' decision making and its time effects in ZG City of China, by using the discrete spatial choice modeling. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant negative impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a protective role in preventing street robbers' criminal activities. Interestingly, we found that the protective effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. The protective role of ambient population and surveillance cameras is stable daily through the week, but diurnally, the influence of ambient population shows temporal fluctuation, while the impact of surveillance cameras is temporally stable. These findings can be of some reference for police control and crime geography research by: 1) Carrying out the experimental evaluation of surveillance camera system's prevention and control effect, and dynamic optimization and adjustment of surveillance cameralocations. 2) Arranging a suitable amount of mixed functional land in urban planning or urban renewal to strengthen the moderation of ambient population through planning or management. 3) Focusing on diurnal variability in future studies of the time effects. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - Trajectory data contains abundant temporal and spatial information of moving objects. By calculating and analyzing trajectory data, behavior patterns of mobile objects can be found. Among these behavior patterns the discovery of chasing patterns is interesting which will provide effective services for intelligent urban traffic management, criminal investigation, environmental monitoring and other application fields. However, existing chasing pattern discovery methods only compare the local similarity of trajectories, and do not consider the potential significance of stay points or change in speed. This article proposes a new algorithm for chasing pattern discovery based on the stay point detection technology. An optimized stay point detection algorithm is also designed to improve the distance calculation method. The algorithms were evaluated with real and simulation trajectory data and achieved very good results which have higher accuracy and recall rate compared with the existing chasing pattern discovery algorithms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Telephony technologies (mobile, VoIP, and fixed) have potentially improved the way we communicate in our daily life and have been widely adopted for business and personal communications. At the same time, scammers, criminals, and fraudsters have also find the telephony network an attractive and affordable medium to target end-users with the advertisement, marketing of legal and illegal products, and bombard them with the huge volume of unwanted calls. These calls would not only trick call recipients into disclosing their private information such as credit card numbers, PIN code which can be used for financial fraud but also causes a lot of displeasure because of continuous ringing. The fraudsters, political campaigners can also use telephony systems to spread malicious information (hate political or religious messages) in real-time through audio or text messages, which have serious political and social consequences if malicious callers are not mitigated in a quick time. In this context, the identification of malicious callers would not only minimize telephony fraud but would also bring peace to the lives of individuals. One way to classifies users as a spammer or legitimate is to get feedback from the call recipients about their recent interactions with the caller, but these systems not only bring inconvenience to callees but also require changes in the system design. The call detail records extensively log the activities of users and can be used to categorize them as the spammer and non-spammer. In this paper, we utilize the information from the call detailed records and proposed a spam detection framework for the telephone network that identifies malicious callers by utilizing the social behavioral features of users within the network. To this extent, we first model the behavior of the users as the directed social graph and then analyze different features of the social graph i.e. the Relationship Network and Call patterns of users towards their peers. We then used these features along with the decision tree to classify callers into three classes i.e. human, spammer and call center. We analyzed the call record data-set consisting of more than 2 million users. We have conducted a detailed evaluation of our framework which demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving acceptable detection accuracy and extremely low false-positive rate. The performance results show that the spammers and call center numbers not only have a large number of non-repetitive calls but also have a large number of short duration calls. Similarly, on the other hand, the legitimate callers have a good number of repetitive calls and most of them interacted for a relatively long duration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment involving subway station closures to examine how subway ridership is associated with the impact of robbery victimization within spatial network buffers immediately surrounding subway stations in Bronx (County), New York. The New York City subway system is the busiest in the USA, with an annual ridership estimated at 1.8 billion people. Key findings of this research include noteworthy relationships between robbery hot spots and subway stations, as well as substantial reductions in robbery frequency during temporary subway station closures, with larger reductions occurring in closer proximities to the subway stations. There was also a significant robbery pattern “normalization process” that occurred after the closed subway stations were reopened where robbery frequency returned to historically “normal” pre-closure levels. These notable decreases of crime in and around subway stations during the station closure time periods, as well as the prominent increases in robbery when subway stations reopened, should be taken into consideration when planning transit maintenance, conducting crime prevention initiatives, and scheduling crime control strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mobility among sex workers has been linked not only to improved economic and social opportunities, but also to concerns regarding displacement, criminalization, and violence. In 2014, new “end-demand” legislation criminalized new aspects of sex work in Canada (e.g., third-party advertising, purchasing) while leaving the sale of sex legal. Utilizing data from a longitudinal community-based cohort of women sex workers in Metro Vancouver (An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access [AESHA], 2010-2016), we used kernel density mapping to understand and identify geographic patterns of workplace neighborhood mobility (i.e., changing the primary neighborhood in which one worked in the last 6 months); multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was also used to model contextual (policing, violence, and safety) and individual correlates of workplace mobility among sex workers over the 6-year period, including potential changes in mobility patterns pre- and post-end-demand criminalization. A total of 543 sex workers were included in analyses, contributing 2,199 observations. A total of 402 (74.0%) experienced workplace neighborhood mobility during the study period. Neighborhood mobility was negatively correlated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98/year older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.97, 0.99]) and positively correlated with homelessness (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = [1.12, 1.82]), identifying as a gender/sexual minority (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.70]), and servicing clients primarily outdoors (vs. informal indoor or in-call venues; AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = [1.21, 1.81]); police harassment (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI = [0.96, 1.48], p =.11) and changing one’s neighborhood of work due to safety concerns (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = [0.94, 2.00], p =.09) were both marginally correlated. Steps to promote safer working conditions for marginalized women in urban environments remain urgently needed, including shifts away from criminalized enforcement toward community-led initiatives and promoting access to safer indoor workspaces. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Space and time are two dimensions of importance in modeling data for mobility analysis, and in many realms of studies, space and time are vital in recognizing various mobility patterns for analyzing massive data. Data featuring both the dimensions of space and time is called spatiotemporal data. Spatiotemporal data have been recorded in studies such as climate science, neuroscience, social sciences, mobile health, epidemiology, transportation, criminology, and earth science (Liu and Qu 2016; Atluri et al. 2017), to generate useful information. In fact, these fields experience a rapid transformation with the proliferation of vast amount of available spatiotemporal data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, corrected publication 2022.

AB  - In criminology, the rational choice perspective assumes that offenders decide whether or not to commit a crime by weighing the effort, rewards, and costs involved in alternative courses of action. One of the most important costs for offenders is to be identified and arrested by police. In order to avoid arrest, offenders have to rely on specific strategies. In sexual assaults, in addition to appropriate target selection, offenders must make sure to avoid police detection by protecting their identity and cleaning up or destroy forensic evidence that may be left at the crime scene and that can directly lead to their identification. This behavior is known as ‘forensic awareness’. Research on forensic awareness strategies during the crime-commission process is scant. A number of studies looking specifically at sexual crimes identified certain strategies related to forensic awareness. According to the rational choice perspective, the use of strategies to avoid police detection should have an impact on the crime solving by police. Few studies have investigated this issue and findings are quite unexpected. The aim of this chapter is to review some of the most important empirical knowledge on the use of forensic awareness strategies in sexual crimes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Although evidence regarding the journey-to-crime in juvenile offenders is available for some areas of the world, little is known about their mobility patterns in Southern Europe. Variables such as prosocial facilities, transport stations, or socioeconomic backdrop have been proved to influence the traveled distance. Therefore, we aimed to confirm previous findings in the journey-to-crime literature using data provided by the Juvenile Justice Department of the Basque Country (Spain). Although some results are in line with those of previous studies, emphasizing the relevance of environmental factors for better understanding crime patterns in the juvenile population, other specific patterns also emerged that suggest the need to replicate research across countries and to consider specific behavior patterns and styles of spatial design in each study setting. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Advances in both telecommunications and Information technology have improved the way users do business online. Android, an open-source mobile operating system, is becoming an attractive target for cyber criminals to exploit due to its predefined permission model. Without classification, the mobile operating system permits installation of mobile applications of all kinds, including Trojans, thus making its trustworthiness into question. In this paper, we present a security system called collaborative policy-based security scheme (CSS) that permits users to customize the access permissions of Android applications during runtime. The proposed CSS security scheme validates the trustworthiness of each application before being installed. The experimental results show that the proposed CSS successfully detects all malicious applications with a run-time overhead of 2.7%. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Iris recognition of living individuals is a mature biometric modality that has been adopted globally from governmental ID programs, border crossing, voter registration and de-duplication, to unlocking mobile phones. On the other hand, the possibility of recognizing deceased subjects with their iris patterns has emerged recently. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning-based method for postmortem iris segmentation and recognition with a special visualization technique intended to support forensic human examiners in their efforts. The proposed postmortem iris segmentation approach outperforms the state of the art and - in addition to iris annulus, as in case of classical iris segmentation methods - detects abnormal regions caused by eye decomposition processes, such as furrows or irregular specular highlights present on the drying and wrinkling cornea. The method was trained and validated with data acquired from 171 cadavers, kept in mortuary conditions, and tested on subject-disjoint data acquired from 259 deceased subjects. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of data used in postmortem iris recognition research to date. The source code of the proposed method are offered with the paper. The test data will be available through the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) archives.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The increased use of secure social media apps on smartphones has attracted the interest of criminals looking to engage in illegal activities. The additional user confidentiality requirements, as well as the security features of these applications, complicate forensic investigations. The extensive analysis of encrypted traffic sessions, on the other hand, has the potential of identifying involved parties and their activities. In this paper, we conduct a network traffic analysis of Twitter, a popular social media application that uses encryption to protect information transmitted over the network. We concentrate on the Android platform to generate Twitter traffic, analyze fixed patterns, and extract artifacts based on various user actions. A firewall is also used to investigate Twitter's hidden design flexibilities and alternate connectivity options. Through our analysis, we were able to correctly identify the flow of Twitter traffic, user-related information, and fixed patterns to classify different user activities on Twitter.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - While Eastern European migration is predominantly seen as one-way, permanent, for economic reasons, and as going bilaterally from East to West Europe, this book investigates alternative patterns of migration and mobility across Europe. This original new book explores how visual artists take part in regular cross-border mobilities, onward migrations and transnational communications across Europe for work and the effects of this on their feelings of home and belonging. It assesses how far there is a culture of mobility amongst visual artists from the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, for whom a combination of onward migration and regular cross-border mobilities is a necessity for career progression. This is due to the ‘glass ceiling’ in the Baltic States with regard to a lack of local art markets, few dealers buying art and governments not providing enough funding. How then do artists from the Baltic States get onto the global art market in the face of such barriers? This is a particularly important question, as these artists come from a region where migration, mobilities and cross-cultural exchanges were not freely available during the Soviet Union. This transdisciplinary investigation into visual artists’ working practices, ways of moving and placing dwellings addresses this issue. Mobile working practices have an impact on artists’ feelings of home and belonging, which can be seen in their artworks that compare different cultures. This is a result of their particular combination of onward migration and regular mobilities, the multiple flows in and out of the home cities and the workings of the global art market within which these artists are operating. Nevertheless, these movements are determined by the forces of the global art world, whereby a particular politics of migration and mobility is experienced by artists from the Baltic States wanting to ‘make it’ in the global art world. With its focus on Baltic artists and their mobilities, the scope and space explored is the whole of Europe and the mobilities explored in this text are crucially enabled by the freedom of movement in the European Union. The book is multidisciplinary and at the intersection of art, geographic mobility and creative practice. It combines visual cultures and social sciences in order to answer questions more thoroughly as well as to contextualise an analysis of artworks in a conversation with the artists themselves. This topic is current, with the situation of the ‘refugee crisis’ and Brexit that has created a culture of anti-immigration and resurgence in anti-Eastern European sentiment in government, mainstream media and society. The book discusses the implications of these complex itineraries on the conventional sociological notions of home, mobility and diaspora. The author argues that artists form a ‘diaspora of practice’ rather than of ethnicity, their homes are multiple as are the directions of their settlement. Primary appeal will be to artists and art professionals; scholars working and researching on mobilities and migration issues; those working on the concepts of belonging and home; sociologists; anthropologists; those in the fields of cultural studies and European Union studies. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - People ebb and flow across the city. The spatial and temporal patterning of crime is, in part, reflective of this mobility, of the scale of the population present in any given setting at a particular time. It is also a function of capacity of this population to perform an active role as an offender, victim or guardian in any specific crime type, itself shaped by the time-variant activities undertaken in, and the qualities of, particular settings. To this end, this paper explores the intra-daily influence of activities and settings upon the weekday spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public spaces. This task is achieved through integrating a transient population dataset with travel survey, point-of-interest and recorded crime data in a study of Great Manchester (UK). The research deploys a negative binomial regression model controlling for spatial lag effects. It finds strong and independent, but time-variant, associations between leisure activities, leisure settings and the spatial and temporal patterning of violent crime in public space. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This open access book explores how biometric data is increasingly flowing across borders in order to limit, control and contain the mobility of selected people, namely criminalized populations. It introduces the concept of bio-bordering, using it to capture reverse patterns of bordering and ordering practices linked to transnational biometric data exchange regimes. The concept is useful to reconstruct how the territorial foundations of national state autonomy are partially reclaimed and, at the same time, partially purposefully suspended. The book focuses on the Prüm system, which facilitates the mandatory exchange of forensic DNA data amongst EU Member States. The Prüm system is an underexplored phenomenon, representing diverse instances of bio-bordering and providing a complex picture of the hidden (dis)integration of Europe. Particular legal, scientific, technical and political dimensions related to the governance and uses of biometric technologies in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom are specifically explored to demonstrate both similar and distinct patterns. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - More than half a million people in the U.S. experience homelessness every day. Lacking other options, many turn to transit vehicles, stops, and stations for shelter. Many also ride public transit to reach various destinations. With affordable housing scarce and the numbers of unhoused individuals often surpassing the capacities of existing safety nets and support systems, transit operators face homelessness as a pressing issue on their systems and must implement policy measures from other realms beyond transportation to address it. Because of the health and safety implications for transit of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated further rise in homelessness from the resulting economic downturn, studying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable travelers is critical. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify articles discussing homelessness in transit systems. While only a handful of articles exist from the 1990s, there is an emerging literature in the last 20 years that examines different aspects of homelessness in transit systems. We identify and review 63 articles on homelessness in transit systems and other public settings to better understand the extent of homelessness in the U.S., and how transit agencies perceive its impacts. We also summarise literature findings on the travel patterns of unsheltered individuals, which show that public transit represents an important and common mode of travel for them. Lastly, we focus on responses to homelessness from the part of transit operators. We find two types of responses: 1) punitive, in which criminalisation, policing and enforcement of laws and codes of conduct prevail, and 2) outreach-related, which aim towards providing help and support to unsheltered individuals. We conclude by summarising our findings as well as the existing gaps in the literature. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Environmental and land defenders play a crucial role in attempts to slow down environmental change and address power inequalities in land-use and resource development. Yet, they frequently face repression, including defamation, criminalization, and assassination. Recent policy and media coverage initiatives have provided much needed attention to the protection and support of defenders, but there has so far been little systematic analysis of patterns and determinants of repression at multiple scales. Here, we use databases providing the best available worldwide record of cases of socio-environmental conflicts and killings of defenders to identify patterns of repression and potential determinants of killings. Globally, about a third of socio-environmental conflicts involve mass mobilization, arrests and direct forms of violence. These ‘high intensity’ conflicts are more frequent in Asia and Latin America. At least 1734 killings of environmental and land defenders took place in a total of 53 countries between 2002 and 2018, most of them occurring in Brazil, the Philippines, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Peru. Our multivariate analysis indicates that major country-level determinants of killings include income level, foreign direct investment, dependency on mineral extraction, regime type, frequency of protest movements, and size of Indigenous populations. We suggest that more systematic reporting and analysis of repression – including through subnational level studies for which we provide testable hypotheses – can help protect and support defenders, notably through conflict-sensitive investment policies and greater accountability for abuses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Technology has brought great benefits to human beings and has served to improve the quality of life and carry out great discoveries. However, its use can also involve many risks. Examples include mobile devices, digital cameras and video surveillance cameras, which offer excellent performance and generate a large number of images and video. These files are generally shared on social platforms and are exposed to any manipulation, compromising their authenticity and integrity. In a legal process, a manipulated video can provide the necessary elements to accuse an innocent person of a crime or to exempt a guilty person from criminal acts. Therefore, it is essential to create robust forensic methods, which will strengthen the justice administration systems and thus make fair decisions. This paper presents a novel forensic technique to detect the post-processing of digital videos with MP4, MOV and 3GP formats. Concretely, detect the social platform and editing program used to execute possible manipulation attacks. The proposed method is focused on supervised machine learning techniques. To achieve our goal, we take advantage that the social platforms and editing programs, execute filtering and compression processes on the videos when they are shared or manipulated. The result of these transformations leaves a characteristic pattern in the videos that allow us to detect the social platform or editing program efficiently. Three phases are involved in the method: 1) Dataset preparation; 2) data features extraction; 3) Supervised model creation. To evaluate the scalability of the technique in real scenarios, we used a robust, heterogeneous and far superior dataset than that used in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Covering key issues ranging from education to political mobilization to racial stratification, this book provides a comprehensive examination of the Obama Presidency. President Barack Obama’s election and subsequent reelection represent a critical paradigm shift in American political history. But are there lasting effects of the election of an African American to the highest office in the land in terms of the United States’ economic, educational, political and social realities? A valuable resource for undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, state and federal policymakers, and general readers, this book poses critical questions and offers insightful answers from expert contributors, provides a balanced critique of President Obama’s accomplishments and challenges, and considers the national and international impact President Obama’s tenure had on politics. The numerous contributors to this book provide a range of perspectives on President Obama’s presidency that question conventional thinking, covering key issues that include health care, education, political mobilization, gender, racial stratification, voting patterns, and criminal justice. Readers will come away with a heightened comprehension of the complex relationships between political structures, economic policies, and minority interests; how Congress, traditional and contemporary activists, and domestic and international issues all shaped the Obama Presidency; and how micro and macro issues such as voting rights, voting patterns, and Get Out the Vote (GOTV) initiatives are connected. © 2017 by Larry J.

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that “taste” preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The core goal of this paper is to identify guidance on how the research community can better transition their research into payment card fraud detection towards a transformation away from the current unacceptable levels of payment card fraud. Payment card fraud is a serious and long-term threat to society (Ryman-Tubb and d'Avila Garcez, 2010) with an economic impact forecast to be $416bn in 2017 (see Appendix A).1 The proceeds of this fraud are known to finance terrorism, arms and drug crime. Until recently the patterns of fraud (fraud vectors) have slowly evolved and the criminals modus operandi (MO) has remained unsophisticated. Disruptive technologies such as smartphones, mobile payments, cloud computing and contactless payments have emerged almost simultaneously with large-scale data breaches. This has led to a growth in new fraud vectors, so that the existing methods for detection are becoming less effective. This in turn makes further research in this domain important. In this context, a timely survey of published methods for payment card fraud detection is presented with the focus on methods that use AI and machine learning. The purpose of the survey is to consistently benchmark payment card fraud detection methods for industry using transactional volumes in 2017. This benchmark will show that only eight methods have a practical performance to be deployed in industry despite the body of research. The key challenges in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to fraud detection are discerned. Future directions are discussed and it is suggested that a cognitive computing approach is a promising research direction while encouraging industry data philanthropy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim: Developing a theory explaining how public health nurses accomplish and adapt counselling in lifestyle habits to decrease obesity in people with mobility disability. Design: Empirical research - qualitative. Method: Classic grounded theory with face-to-face interviews, 2017–2018, using inductive approach to understand public health nurses' intervening experiences with obesity patients. Results: To initiate the conversation emerged as the main concern meaning having difficulties initiating conversations about obesity with patients. Public health nurses’ facilitators to communicate lifestyle changes emerged as the pattern generating the theory, which consists of the categories; person-centeredness in the situation, experience and knowledge, strengthening conditions, access to other professionals and prioritization in everyday work. Conclusions: Public health nurses hesitate to raise topics of obesity in patients with mobility disability. They advocate increased integration with lifestyle changes in everyday work including multi-professional cooperation. The implication is testing the emerged theory at primary health care centres. Impact: Obesity is more common in people with mobility disability than in those without. There is a need to understand how public health nurses adapt counselling in lifestyle habits. Public health nurses hesitate to talk about obesity with patients in fear of offending anyone. Public health nurses did not distinguish between patients with or without mobility disability. Several facilitators could be helpful initiating conversation with the patients. Public health nurses need more time and resources to facilitate conversation with patients with mobility disability to counsel lifestyle changes. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The general theories of criminality, both the different unitary explanations of Lombroso, Tarde, and Bonger, and the pluralistic interpretation of Ferri proved to be of little or no value in the control of behavior. The Study of the Delinquent as an Individual: Healy substituted for the methods of general observation, speculation, and statistics the all-round study of the individual delinquent. Trained in psychiatry and psychology, he emphasized physical examinations and mental tests without ignoring social factors. However, he relied upon the experience of the social worker instead of calling into service the technique of the sociologist. The Person as the Individual with Status: The study of individual behavior falls in the fields of psychiatry and psychology. The study of the person, as the product of social interaction, lies, primarily, in sociology. In the explanation and control of delinquency, it is significant to determine the nature of the participation of the person in the social organization, as in the insecurity or degradation of status, the type of personal behavior pattern, the degree of mobility, the change of the social environment and the collapse of the social world of the person. In the study of delinquency, the psychiatric, psychological, and sociological methods of investigation are not in conflict with each other, but rather complementary and interdependent. © Jeffery T.

AB  - We assessed the impact of planned aggression across homicide mobility types in Newark, New Jersey, from 1997 through 2007. Homicides where offenders traveled to victims’ resident/incident locales were more likely to involve aggressive intent, whereas homicides where victims traversed to offender/incident locales were less likely to involve planned aggression. Planned aggression was unrelated to geographically proximate (internal) homicides as well as geographically distinct (total mobility) homicides. Study findings show that routine activities and situational characteristics are not only important in explaining homicide patterns but also demonstrate that planned aggression meaningfully contributes to the routine activities and environmental criminology frameworks under specific geographic conditions. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This article makes use of hourly crime counts to model the relationship between events that take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and robberies, an arena that has caused local controversy regarding the costs and benefits of hosting such an entertainment venue. Results from the econometric model suggest that the NHL’s New Jersey Devils ice hockey games, concerts, and Disney-themed events are all associated with increases in robbery, while various other event categories such as the NBA basketball games played by the Nets and boxing, and mixed martial arts (MMA) matches are not associated with an increase. These findings support two complementary ecological theories of crime that focus on how events provide additional opportunities for crime by increasing the associated benefits while simultaneously decreasing the cost for economically motivated offenders to take advantage of. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Short message service (SMS) can be used as digital evidence of disclosure of crime because it can strengthen the charges against the offenders. Criminals use various ways to destroy the evidence, including by deleting SMS. On the Android OS, SMS is stored in a SQLite database file. Deletion of SMS data is not followed by bit deletion in memory so that it is possible to rediscover the deleted SMS. Based on this case, the mobile forensic needs to be done to rediscover the short message service. The proposed method in this study is Boyer-Moore algorithm for searching string matching. An auto finds feature is designed to rediscover the short message service by searching using a particular pattern to rematch a text with the result of the hex value conversion in the database file. The system will redisplay the message for each of a match. From all the testing results, the proposed method has quite a high accuracy in rediscovering the short message service using the used dataset. The search results to rediscover the deleted SMS depend on the possibility of overwriting process and the vacuum procedure on the database file. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Examining the role of individual differences in perceptions of risk and rewards to offending has become an important line of inquire (Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, & Madensen, 2006); however, psychopathy has yet to be considered. We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending. © 2019

AB  - Background: For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geographical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns. Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013. Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern. Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces. Conclusions: Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender’s home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers’ location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Smartphone have become a prime target for cyber criminals. Android being the market leader is the major target of malicious attackers. Covert techniques used by the malware make them hard to detect with signature based methods. In this paper, we present AndroPIn - a novel Android based malware detection tool using Permissions and Intents. The proposed framework overcomes the limitation of stealthy techniques used by malware by exploiting the usage pattern of permissions and intents. These features, which play a major role in sharing user data and device resources cannot be obfuscated or altered. These vital features are well suited for resource constrained smartphones. Experimental evaluation on a corpus of real-world malware and benign apps demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect malicious apps with a low runtime overheads and is resilient to common obfuscations methods. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Building on W. J. T. Mitchell’s (2012) insights on ‘race as a medium’ and a ‘framework of seeing through or seeing as,’ this essay argues that debates on Sudanese ‘criminal gangs’ in Melbourne, Australia; policies to counter alleged ‘radicalisation’ among Muslim youth in the UK; the continuing struggles for indigenous land rights; and rejections of asylum seekers almost everywhere in the West, attest to the operations of technologies of bureaucracy which, in turn, mobilise racially prejudiced systems of classification and patterns of misrecognition. Understanding the present conjuncture or the current crisis is integral to any politics opposing such classificatory systems and prejudicial ideologies. As Stuart Hall has reminded us, this involves taking into account ‘“relatively autonomous” sites—which have different origins, are driven by different contradictions, and develop according to their own temporalities’ which ‘are nevertheless “convened” or condensed in the same moment’ (Hall and Massey in Soundings 44: 38). Arguments over what constitutes the ‘real’ in these instances are not so much about ‘fake news’ as the ways in which images go ‘before’ the black immigrant, the Muslim youth, the asylum seeker, or the indigenous community in the form of abiding stereotypes that shape newer systems of misrecognition and misrepresentation. However, analysing the present conjuncture and the current crisis, of which such forms of misrecognition are emblematic, involves examining not just the ‘dominant’ or hegemonic but also, as Raymond Williams recommended (and John Clarke [2014] recently reiterated), considering the multiple temporalities and formations that together constitute the ‘emergent’ and the ‘residual.’ Using Policing the Crisis as a model, this essay draws on the recent work of W. J. T. Mitchell, Saskia Sassen, Patrick Wolfe, Arjun Appadurai and David Roediger to examine digital mediations/interventions by indigenous and refugee communities, recent protest movements, and the entanglements of race and class to argue that indigenous and refugee communities, along with the global poor, comprise the global subaltern. While the reasons for their current precarity and the various aspects that comprise their subaltern conditions may differ between these groups, the politics of ‘race,’ ethnicity and exclusion, and of representation and ‘voice,’ appear to impinge on both their material and their digital presence in similar ways. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Background Urban drug scenes are characterized by high prevalence of illicit drug dealing and use, violence and poverty, much of which is driven by the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) and the associated stigma. Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter ‘mobility’) among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD. Methods Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group. Results In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05). Conclusions Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES. © 2019 Hayashi et al.

AB  - Background: Childhood poverty is associated with elevated later risks for self-directed and externalised violence, but how risks are modified by parental socioeconomic mobility remains unclear. We investigated parental income trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks of self-harm and violent criminality in young adulthood. Methods: Using Danish national registers, we delineated a nested case-control study of Danish citizens born from Jan 1, 1982, to Dec 31, 2000, with first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and first violent crime convictions at ages 15–33 years. Each case was matched on age and gender to 25 randomly selected controls. Parental income was assessed in birth-year and at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. We considered parental age, the child's number of siblings, parental mental health, and parental education to be covariates. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by conditional logistic regression inherently adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year; we then made additional adjustments for the covariates considered. Findings: We identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-harm, to which we matched 531 675 controls, and 23 724 first violent crime convictions, to which we matched 593 100 controls. We observed inverse relationships between parental income and risks for the two outcomes for each of the ages parental income was measured. The longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, the higher their subsequent risks for self-harm and violent criminality, and vice versa for time spent living in affluent conditions. Associations were stronger for violent criminality than for self-harm. Compared with individuals who were born and remained in the most affluent families, all other income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for both outcomes. Those who remained in the least affluent quintile showed the highest risks for self-harm (IRR 7·2, 95% CI 6·6–7·9; 1174 [6%] cases) and for violent criminality (IRR 13·0; 95% CI 11·9–14·1; 1640 [7%] cases). The risk patterns were attenuated, but essentially persisted, after covariate adjustment. For any parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated with lower risk compared with downward mobility. Interpretation: Parental income represents a multitude of unmeasured familial sociodemographic indices. Tackling the causes of inequality and associated psychosocial and sociocultural challenges to enable upwards socioeconomic mobility could potentially reduce risks for self-directed and externalised violence.

AB  - Since the last decade of the twentieth century, several authors have claimed that the contemporary and ‘new’ developments in (private) policing and crime control form part of the process of neo-liberal policies and rational choice approaches to crime. However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increased use of secure chat and voice/ video apps has transformed the social life. While the benefits and facilitations are seemingly limitless, so are the asscoiacted vulnerabilities and threats. Besides ensuring confidentiality requirements for common users, known facts of non-readable contents over the network make these apps more attractive for criminals. Though access to contents of cryptograhically secure sessions is not possible, network forensics of secure apps can provide interesting information which can be of great help during criminal invetigations. In this paper, we presented a novel framework of profiling the secure chat and voice/ video calling apps which can be employed to extract hidden patterns about the app, information of involved parties, activities of chatting, voice/ video calls, status indications and notifications while having no information of communication protocol of the app and its security architecture. Signatures of any secure app can be developed though our framework and can become base of a large scale solution. Our methodology is considered very important for different cases of criminal investigations and bussiness intelligence solutions for service provider networks. Our results are applicable to any mobile platform of iOS, android and windows. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Having outperformed 5 billion human beings associated with mobile services in the year 2017, the worldwide mobile industry will achieve a significant stage at a higher level in the succeeding eight years. The quantity of distinctive versatile subscribers will achieve 5.9 billion by 2025, proportional to 71% of the total world's population. The Android operating system is the most broadly utilized smart phone operating system. Android operating system provides the subsequent category of security screen lock mechanism options namely pattern lock, PIN lock, password lock, etc. Pattern lock is a prevalent method to secure Android mobile phone as they are a considerable measure less demanding to recollect than PIN codes or passwords. Actually, around 40% of Android mobile phone proprietors decide on this lock technique which expects them to draw a confidential design on a grid of specks to ingress the device. Due to the expanded portability of the smart phones and its security features, users are storing their important personal information into the smart phones and In the meantime time the criminals can utilize Smartphone for various tasks. Namely perpetrate a criminal deception intended to result over email intimidation through text messages, drug trafficking, child erotica etc. If the mobile device is identified in a criminal activity and if it is locked then it is a challenge to the forensic investigator to bypass the screen lock. In this research paper we proposed a new CS (Chandrasekhar and Srinivas) pattern cracker algorithm, to crack the pattern lock of the Android mobile phone without data loss for forensic examination. The research methodology describes how to unbar the pattern lock. The experimental results shows how to unlock simple and hardest pattern locks by using the CS pattern cracker algorithm. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assesses the seasonal scheduling of shellfish harvesting among hunter-gatherer populations along the southernmost coast of South Africa, based on a large number of serial oxygen isotope analyses of marine mollusk shells from four archaeological sites. The south coast of South Africa boasts an exceptional record of coastal hunter-gatherer occupation spanning the Holocene, the last glacial cycle and beyond. The significance of coastal adaptations, in this region in particular, for later modern human evolution has been prominently debated. Shellfishing behaviors are an important focus for investigation given the dietary and scheduling implications and the abundant archaeological shell remains in numerous sites. Key to better understanding coastal foraging is whether it was limited to one particular season, or year-round. Yet, this has proven very difficult to establish by conventional archaeological methods. This study reconstructs seasonal harvesting patterns by calculating water temperatures from the final growth increment of shells. Results from two Later Stone Age sites, Nelson Bay Cave (together with the nearby Hoffman's Robberg Cave) and Byneskranskop 1, show a pronounced cool season signal, which is unexpected given previous ethnographic documentation of summer as the optimal season for shellfishing activities and inferences about hunter-gatherer scheduling and mobility in the late Holocene. Results from two Middle Stone Age sites, Klasies River and Pinnacle Point 5–6, show distinct seasonal patterns that likely reflect the seasonal availability of resources in the two locations. The Pinnacle Point 5–6 assemblage, which spans the MIS5-4 transition, records a marked shift in shellfishing seasonality at c. 71 ka that aligns with other indications of archaeological and environmental change at this time. We conclude that the scheduling and intensity of shellfishing in this region is affected by a suite of factors, including environmental and cultural drivers, rather than a single variable, such as population growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study of how the environment, local geography, and physical locations influence crime has a long history that stretches across a number of research traditions. These include the neighborhood-effects approach developed by the Chicago school of sociology in the 1920s; modern environmental criminology that explains the geographic distribution of crime; the criminology of place, which focuses on crime rates at specific places over time; and a newer approach that attends to the perception of crime and disorder in communities. Aided by new mobile and digital technologies as well as improved data reporting in recent decades, research in environmental criminology has developed at a rapid pace within each of these approaches. Despite these advances, research in the subfield of environmental criminology remains fragmented, and competing theories are often kept apart. This book takes a different approach and integrates the subfield as a whole. It covers the core theoretical and empirical issues of how and why the environment influences the emergence of crime and how crime can affect the environment. The chapters reflect the diversity in research and theory from all over the Western world. In addition to covering traditional criminological research, the book probes how well current theories of environmental criminology contribute to our understanding of new problems and how well theories travel to other areas, such as West Africa, in which cultural differences might lead to different patterns in offending. © Oxford University Press 2018.

AB  - Pioneered in Boston as part of its Operation Ceasefire strategy to halt serious youth violence in the 1990s, focused deterrence approaches (also known as “pulling levers” policing) have been embraced by police departments in the United States and other countries as an effective approach to crime prevention (Travis, 1998; Dalton, 2002; Deuchar, 2013). In its simplest form, the approach consists of selecting a particular crime problem, such as youth homicide; convening an interagency working group of law enforcement practitioners; conducting research to identify key offenders, groups, and behavior patterns; framing a response to offenders and groups of offenders that uses a varied menu of sanctions to stop them from continuing their violent behavior; focusing social services and community resources on targeted offenders and groups to match law enforcement prevention efforts; and directly and repeatedly communicating with offenders to make them understand why they are receiving this special attention (Kennedy, 1997; Kennedy, Chapter 9 in this volume). Although the goal of focused deterrence strategies is to prevent crime by changing offender perceptions of sanction risk, other complementary crime prevention mechanisms seem to support the crime control efficacy of these programs (Braga & Kennedy, 2012; Kennedy, Kleiman & Braga, 2017). These strategies are also intended to change offender behavior by mobilizing community action, enhancing procedural justice, and improving police legitimacy. © Cambridge University Press 2019.

AB  - Detection and recognition of a vehicle license plate is a fundamental requirement of any intelligent transport system, primarily to support activities like finding a stolen vehicle, vehicle surveillance/tracking, parking-toll collection, traffic flow planning and management, etc. However, a license plate can easily be stolen and/or changed by those with criminal intent to conceal their identity. This paper proposes a new vehicle identification system to obtain high degree of accuracy and success rate by not only considering the license plate but also shape of the vehicle. The proposed system is based on four steps: license plate detection, license plate recognition, license plate jurisdiction (province) detection and the vehicle shape detection. In the proposed system, the features are converted into local binary pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as training dataset. To obtain high degree of accuracy in real-time application, a novel method based on cascaded classifiers is used to update the system. The proposed system allows us to store features of vehicles and related information in the database, thus, allowing us to automatically detect any discrepancy between a license plate and vehicle associated with it.  © 2019 ACM.

AB  - Objectives: This paper tests the economic theory of criminal behavior. Specifically, it looks at “the carrot” side of the theory, studying how thieves react to changes in monetary gains from crime. Methods: Using a unique crime-level dataset on metal theft in the Czech Republic, we study thieves’ behavior in a simple regression framework. We argue that variation in metal prices represents a quasi-experimental variation in gains from crime. It is because (1) people steal copper and other nonferrous metals only to sell them to scrapyard and (2) prices at scrapyards are set by the world market. This facilitates causal interpretation of our regression estimates. Results: We find that a 1% increase (decrease) in the re-sale price causes metal thefts to increase (decrease) by 1–1.5%. We show that the relationship between prices and thefts is very robust. Moreover, we find that thieves’ responses to price shocks are rapid and consistent. Conclusion: Our results are in line with the economic model of crime, wherein criminal behavior is modeled as a rational agent’s decision driven by the costs and benefits of undertaking criminal activities. Our estimates are also consistent with recent results from the United Kingdom, suggesting these patterns are more general. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Despite extensive studies of street culture and the risks of offending and victimization in urban marginalized areas, little is known about the role of cultural repertoires for variation in victimization risks among young men not involved in crime. Based on two ethnographic studies, conducted independently of the authors in neighbouring township areas of Cape Town, we offer insights into patterns of victimization among young men not involved in crime who live and attend school in the townships. Young men who perform decent cultural repertoires are highly exposed to victimization due to their moral rejection of crime-involved youth. Young men who perform flexible cultural repertoires, by incorporating and shifting between gang and decent repertoires, experience low victimization due to their adaptation to crime-involved youth. Findings emphasize the importance of detailed investigations of the way varying cultural repertoires, in particularly heterogeneous flexible repertoires, influence offending and victimization patterns among young men in high-risk settings. © 2016, © The British Association of Hand Therapists Ltd 2016.

AB  - Nowadays, police are facing with the challenge that crime increases far more rapidly than police force, which generate many problems and cause the police have to seek for support from new technical ways. In this background, the new concept of intelligence-led-policing was proposed. This concept indicated that police should actively identify and analyze the problems by collecting data, such that the potential threatens could be known in early stage and prevention resources would be deployed in more efficient ways. In this paper, a typical work big data analysis in policing was introduced. Pickpocketing offence is a kind of frequently occurred crime in public transportation, and identifying offenders is a great challenge for the police. With nearly a billion of metro subway traffic records accessed from Beijing metro line company, the passengers' routine mobility pattern was analyzed and some pickpocketing suspects were detected by defining some specific rules. The results indicated that significant traveling patterns exist for routine passengers, and some exceptional individuals who has the unique pattern which is quite different from routine passengers are discovered. However, the shortage of the work still exists as the identity of cardholders is anonymous and it cannot be confirmed, but it still provides an example of big data analysis in public security, which might inspire police for further work. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Immigrants and natives are generally comparable in committing violent crimes in many Western cities. However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: The extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Objective: According to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes. Methods: Geocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime. Results: Accounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted. Conclusions: The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Assumptions and debates on the causes/motives and, by implication, theories of kidnapping in Nigeria for ransom, are legions, and largely speculative, however. This paper engages in a rigorous analytical review of the factors, patterns and processes of kidnapping, and several related theories, to construct an integrated/alliance model of kidnapping in Nigeria. Kidnappers’ social constructions and interpretative meanings show that the factors and processes that enable kidnapping to occur are, though, basically economic and space-based, they vary, occurs in chains-spaces in a coordinated, interdependent and interconnected manner. The policy implication suggests (1) that several factors coalesce and intervene at different stages to explain kidnapping (2) future research on kidnapping and meaning construction consider the kidnappers’ perspective and those of the other actors and the media (3) a multi-dimensional and interdisciplinary (Epi-criminology) approach to tackle the several different theories/causes animating young Nigerians to engage in the criminal enterprise of kidnapping is a welcome development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, simulation techniques have been applied to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime. Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with prevention strategies, and crime prediction purposes, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents an agent-based model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure and location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as proxy for human activity. 18 mobility strategies have been tested, combining search distance strategies (e.g. Levy flight, inspired by insights in human dynamics literature) and destination selection strategies (enriched with Foursquare data). We analyze and compare the different mobility strategies, and show the impact of using activity nodes extracted from social networks to simulate offender mobility. This agent-based model provides a basis for comparing offender mobility in crime simulations by inferring offender mobility in urban areas from real world data. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

AB  - Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group and exhibit various offense patterns. Often the location where the offender committed the offense is different from where the offender encountered their victim. Applying crime pattern theory, this study sought to understand if the type of location, victim, and situational characteristics could predict whether an offender would commit the sexual offense in a different and more secluded location than where he first encountered the victim. Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not. Policy implications of the findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - To identify and compare the space–time patterns of vehicle thefts and the effects of associated environmental factors, this paper conducts a case study of the Pudong New Area (PNA), a major urban district in Shanghai, China’s largest city. Geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis indicated that there was a stable pattern of vehicle theft over time. Hotspots of vehicle theft across different time periods were identified. These data provide clues for how law enforcement can prioritize the deployment of limited patrol and investigative resources. Vehicle thefts, especially those of non-motor vehicles, tend to be concentrated in the central-western portion of the PNA, which experienced a dramatic rate of urbanization and has a high concentration of people and vehicles. Important factors contributing to vehicle thefts include a highly mobile and transitory population, a large population density, and high traffic volume. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Modern communication is ubiquitous thanks to the advances in mobile devices and the spread of social networks across the world. It allows people to share ideas, opinions, and experiences. With an ever grown number of users, third party entities promote their services through online advertisements aimed to attract more customers. These services can be even illegal, making this kind of ads deceptive. In this work, we study the use of tweeter for human trafficking criminal network. Mining data from tweets, primarily to identify hidden information is a complicated process, which even requires human intervention. Thus, more sophisticated natural language methods are necessary. In our experiments, the term punters had the most explicit message related to human trafficking services, we find some phrases that depending on the context could lead to criminal activities, and we show that temporal analysis seems an exciting research area to identify behavioral patterns which certainly can help to combat this kind of criminal networks. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Perhaps few decisions have more of an impact on the operational functioning of the criminal justice system than the decision by victims of crime to notify the police. Researchers in the United States and abroad have found that victims often choose not to mobilize the criminal law in the aftermath of a victimization event. A large percentage of property and violent crimes never appear in official crime data estimates. Most remain hidden in the dark figure of crime. Victim nonreporting has numerous implications for criminal justice system processing, crime control policy, and substantive research on the causes and correlates of crime. Studies have long sought to identify the victim-, incident-, and community-based mechanisms that might account for patterns of police notification. Although several important findings have emerged, critical questions remain unanswered. This article provides a critical overview of the determinants of victim nonreporting and charts potential avenues for future research. Copyright ©2017 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This paper analyzes trading and tipping activities in insider trading litigation decided by federal courts from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. Design/methodology/approach: Legal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes. Findings: Results of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements. Originality/value: This paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Android platform has been targeted by cyber-criminals due to the increase number of Android users in 2017. More than 8,000 Android malware were identified everyday making it is difficult for the malware analyst to detect them. Traditional malware detection techniques are no longer reliable to detect newly created malware in short period of time. In this paper, we use a different approach to detect Android malware. The Android malware will be visualised into gray scale images and their image features will be extracted using GIST descriptor. The detection will be done and compare using three different classifiers namely k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The confluence of technological and societal advances, and more specifically, engagement with Web, social media, and smart devices has the potential to affect the mental behavior of the individuals. Examples include extremist and criminal behaviors such as radicalization and cyber-bullying, which are causing serious issues for humanity. Major barriers to the effective understanding of behavioral disorders on social networks includes the ability to understand the content and context of social documents, as well as the activity of social users. Understanding the patterns of behavioral disorders (e.g., criminal and extremist activities) on social networks, is challenging and requires techniques to contextualize the content of social documents based on the time-aware analysis of personality, behaviour and past activities of social users. In this context, semantic information extraction and enrichment from social documents has the potential to become a vital asset to explore the sign of behavioral disorders and prevent serious issues such as cyber-bullying, suicidal related behavior and radicalization. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a novel social document analysis pipeline to enable analysts engage with social documents (e.g., a Tweet in Twitter or a post on Facebook) to explore cognitive aspects of behavioral disorders. We implement the pipeline as an extensible and scalable architecture and present the evaluation results.  © 2019 ACM.

AB  - Background: Microvascular decompression is the most effective treatment for hemifacial spasm. However, when encountering hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery (VA), the procedure is more challenging and requires complicated operation techniques. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of this group of cases and investigated reasonable transposition procedures for different anatomic classifications. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 117 cases that underwent their first microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm between June 2010 and December 2016, which had all associated with vertebral artery compression diagnosed by preoperational radiology examination. The study first classified offending vessels into 3 types according to operative anatomy and designed personalized decompression management according to different forms of neurovascular conflict. Curative effects and complications were assessed. Results: The offending vessels were artificially divided into 3 types according to both arterial pattern and compression direction: 1) ipsilateral VA plus anterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the ventrolateral direction in 72 (61.5%) cases; 2) ipsilateral VA plus posterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve from the caudal-medial direction in 31 (26.5%) cases; 3) bilateral VA compressing the facial nerve in 14 (12.0%) cases. We selected corridors to expose the neurovascular conflict site between the suprafloccular-transhorizontal fissure approach and subtonsillar-transcerebellomedullary fissure approach. The methods of decompression consist of anteromedial and posterolateral transposition by using biomedical glue−coated Teflon sling. Sufficient decompression of the offending vessels was safely performed in all cases. All cases had total relief of symptoms immediately after their operations. Follow-up periods ranged from 16–90 months, and total recovery occurred in 110 cases (94.0%). In 7 cases (6.0%), 90% recovery occurred. Conclusions: Accuracy and comprehensive recognition of anatomic features of the offending vessels are crucial for the management of hemifacial spasm associated with vertebral artery compression. Appropriate approaches combined with the biomedical glue−coated Teflon sling transposition technique can allow adequate mobilization of the vertebral artery and bring complete postoperative symptom relief for most cases. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This chapter reviews what is known about victim selection-that is, the question of why offenders select some people, but not others, to be victims of crime. It first addresses theoretical perspectives on victim selection, namely the structural-choice model of victim selection, social interactionism, and target congruence. It then describes three data sources that have been used in prior research to study victim selection: police reports, victimization surveys, and offender interviews. Subsequently, empirical findings on victim selection are reviewed and organized into nine subsections: victims' demographic characteristics, psychological characteristics, physical characteristics, behavior, biological characteristics, prior victimization, relationship to the offender, behavior during the offense, and the role of randomness. The final section discusses research gaps and potential future directions in the field, including an emphasis on theoretical explanations and mediators, cross-cultural studies, methodological innovation and diversity, interactions between victim and offender characteristics, and generality across crime types and subpopulations. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - Attackers or cyber criminals are getting encouraged to develop android malware because of the rapidly growing rate of android users. To detect android malware, researchers and security specialist have been started to contribute on android malware analysis and detection related tasks using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, Stacked Generalization has been used to minimize the error rate and a multi-level architecture based approach named StackDroid has been presented and evaluated. In this experiment, Extremely Randomized Tree (ET), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifiers have been used as base classifiers in level 1 and Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB) has been used as final predictor in level 2. It’s been found that StackDroid provides 99% of Area Under Curve (AUC), 1.67% of False Positive Rate (FPR) and 97% detection accuracy on DREBIN dataset which provides a strong basement to the development of android malware scanner. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Detecting botnets and advanced persistent threats is a major challenge for network administrators. An important component of such malware is the command and control channel, which enables the malware to respond to controller commands. The detection of malware command and control channels could help prevent further malicious activity by cyber criminals using the malware. Detection of malware in network traffic is traditionally carried out by identifying specific patterns in packet payloads. Now bot writers encrypt the command and control payloads, making pattern recognition a less effective form of detection. This paper focuses instead on an effective anomaly based detection technique for bot and advanced persistent threats using a data mining approach combined with applied classification algorithms. After additional tuning, the final test on an unseen dataset, false positive rates of 0% with malware detection rates of 100% were achieved on two examined malware threats, with promising results on a number of other threats. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Stigma, criminalisation and a lack of data on drug use contribute to the "invisibility" of people who inject drugs (PWID) and make HIV prevention and treatment service delivery challenging. We aimed to confirm locations where PWID congregate in Cape Town, eThekwini and Tshwane (South Africa) and to estimate PWID population sizes within selected electoral wards in these areas to inform South Africa's first multi-site HIV prevention project for PWID. Methods: Field workers (including PWID peers) interviewed community informants to identify suspected injecting locations in selected electoral wards in each city and then visited these locations and interviewed PWID. Interviews were used to gather information about the accessibility of sterile injecting equipment, location coordinates and movement patterns. We used the Delphi method to obtain final population size estimates for the mapped wards based on estimates from wisdom of the crowd methods, the literature and programmatic data. Results: Between January and April 2015, we mapped 45 wards. Tshwane teams interviewed 39 PWID in 12 wards, resulting in an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging from 568 to 1431. In eThekwini, teams interviewed 40 PWID in 15 wards with an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging from 184 to 350. The Cape Town team interviewed 61 PWID in 18 wards with an estimated number of accessible PWID ranging between 398 and 503. Sterile needles were only available at one location. Almost all needles were bought from pharmacies. Between 80 and 86% of PWID frequented more than one location per day. PWID who reported movement visited a median of three locations a day. Conclusions: Programmatic mapping led by PWID peers can be used effectively to identify and reach PWID and build relationships where access to HIV prevention commodities for PWID is limited. PWID reported limited access to sterile injecting equipment, highlighting an important HIV prevention need. Programmatic mapping data show that outreach programmes should be flexible and account for the mobile nature of PWID populations. The PWID population size estimates can be used to develop service delivery targets and as baseline measures. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background and purpose Terrorism is a real and present danger. The build-up to an attack includes planning, travel, and reconnaissance which necessarily require the offender to move through their environment. Whilst research has examined patterns of terrorist attack locations, with a few exceptions (e.g. Rossmo & Harries, 2011), it has not examined the spatial behavior of the terrorists themselves. In this paper, we investigate whether the spatial mobility patterns of terrorists resemble those of criminals (and the wider population) and if these change in the run up to their attacks. Method Using mobile phone data records for the ringleaders of four different UK-based terrorist plots in the months leading up to their attacks, we examine the frequency with which terrorists visit different locations, how far they travel from key anchor points such as their home, the distance between sequential cell-site hits and how their range of movement varies as the planned time to attack approaches. Conclusions Like the wider population (and criminals), the sample of terrorists examined exhibited predictable patterns of spatial behavior. Most movements were close to their home location or safe house, and they visited a relatively small number of locations most of the time. Disaggregating these patterns over time provided mixed evidence regarding the way in which their spatial activity changed as the time to the planned attack approached. The findings are interpreted in terms of how they inform criminological understanding of the spatial behavior of terrorists, and the implications for law enforcement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyber crimes are the felonies that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motivation to harm or create physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet and mobile devices to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes involving target computers to infect them with viruses, malwares, which are then spread to other machines and, entire networks. Data mining applications are utilized in many financial sectors for client segmentation, authentication, credit scores and authorization, predicting payment fault, advertising, detecting and predicting fake transactions, etc. The aim of cyber crime data mining is to recognize patterns in criminal manners in order to predict crime anticipate criminal activity and prevent it. Globally the internet is been accessed by numerous people within their restricted domains. When the client and server exchange information among each other, there is an activity that can be observed in log files. Log files give a entire description of the activities that occur in a network that shows the IP address, login and logout durations, the user behaviour etc. This involves several attacks occurring from the internet. Denial of service is a very dangerous attack that jeopardizes the IT resources of an organization or institution by overloading with imitation messages or multiple requests from unauthorized and unauthenticated users. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - Purpose - Most of the amendments to the law on the improvement of the distribution structure of mobile communication terminal equipment, the fully self-sufficient system of terminals, and the separated disclosure system on the terminals are aimed at securing transparency of the distribution structure by eliminating or reducing handset subsidies. This study investigates what items are important for the purchase of mobile phones in various and rapidly changing mobile phone markets from the consumer's point of view and tries to make a strategic suggestion for future mobile distribution strategies. Research design, data, and methodology - The procedure of this study takes place in four steps. In step 1, only the SF type respondents selected for this study were extracted through MBTI analysis. In step 2, they were divided into three hierarchies for the AHP analysis and each element was arranged. In step 3, the AHP analysis was converted to a Fuzzy-AHP number using the trigonometric centroid method. This was to eliminate the ambiguity of the response by converting into a fuzzy number even if data consistency was maintained with CI value below 0.1. In step 4, the number of converted 2-layer and 3-layer was combined to derive the priority when the final handset is selected. Results - First, the highest importance among the four items in the second tier was the terminal function item, followed by brand, price, and design item. Second, in the third tier, the highest importance was level of after-sales service, followed by device price, processing speed, ease of use, usefulness, and rate system. Third, the arithmetic average of the determinant of the fuzzy function showed that processing speed, ease of use and usefulness in the function item, level of after-sales service in the brand item, and device price in the price item were the five most important factors among 16 choice factors. Conclusions - First, there will be a change in the consumption patterns of consumers who have compared distributors and dealers to purchase handsets with more subsidies. Second, it is highly likely that people will purchase new handsets only when they need to change their devices because they can not receive subsidies by switching phone brands any more. © 2018 Journal of Distribution Science.

AB  - Understanding the geographic and environmental factors that affect local criminal activity is important for crime prevention. In this study, we use data from Geo-Twitter to analyze the reasons underlying the occurrence of local criminal activity. In recent years, abundant location-based social network (LBSN) (e.g., Foursquare, Geo-Twitter) data has become easily available at a low cost. Therefore, many studies have used LBSNs data to model and understand human mobile behavior, such as patterns of human travel and activity. However, few studies on local criminal activities have been reported. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to identify the reasons underlying local criminal activity from the view point of geographic and environmental factors. Our methodology consists of the following steps. First, we collect geo-tagged data from Twitter. In particular, we extract a large corpus with geo-tags, called tweets, from major cities in the United States. Second, we measure the sentiments expressed in tweets posted from a specific area using the fastText model [1]. Third, we apply a simple clustering technique called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify the topics that are clustered in each area using sentimental analysis. Lastly, we analyze the reasons for crime by comparing the topics and the information on all crime using the data portal. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - property crime like residential burglary is a frequently occurred offence in Beijing. For crime reduction, it is important to know if there are hotspots exist and if it does, how many of them are maintained. In this study, spatial and temporal pattern of residential burglary by Policing command unit of Chaoyang district of Beijing is investigated. The method of ESDA (Exploration of Spatial Data Analysis) is proposed for identifying crime hotspots and test their significance. The results demonstrate that identified significant crime hotspots varied by time of day and day of week. Specifically, the burglary was observed to be clustered in center and south of Chaoyang district but none in northern. While by day of week, the patterns of burglary distribution changed and outliers appeared on Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. By time of day, the burglary outlier appeared in the period between 18:00 PM and 22:00 PM. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Mexican human rights organizations accuse the Mexican military and federal police of having taken part in tens of thousands of forced disappearances in the last decade. Curiously, the regions in which people disappear are also sites of displacement and changing patterns of land tenure and production. Yet, property relations are seldom a topic of studies on illegal state activities. Through a state theory lens, including Aníbal Quijano's notion of coloniality of power, this article examines conflicts between private property and communal land tenure such as ejidos in Mexico, as two different property regimes. The article aims to show how the state ensemble not only removes legal protection for communal tenure but also mobilizes legal as well as illegal means to force the change of communal lands into private property. Beyond that, the article also aims to show how these changes in land tenure regulation intersect with the Mexican war on Drugs. © 2018 Pluto Journals.All right reserved.

AB  - Android enabled mobiles/devices are high in use by huge number of users for various purposes. Other than for just calling, most of the users are using these devices for storing and maintaining important data such as personal information, calendar schedules, photos, videos, office documents and much more. These devices are also used for chatting through various instant chat messaging and social networking applications, emailing and internet browsing. In the investigation of many of the cyber crime cases, digital devices enabled with an android operating system are found as prime evidence at the crime scenes. With these devices an investigator can get the handful of information to track the call records, chat messages and activities on the device links to crime happened. This evidence is very useful in tracking down the culprit or criminals involved in the cyber crimes. In order to analyze the found devices, the devices lock must be bypassed to access the available sources of evidence in the digital form. This paper discusses the rooting of the android devices and methods to bypass the pattern lock. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Crime scene analysts are the core of criminal investigations; decisions made at the scene greatly affect the speed of analysis and the quality of conclusions, thereby directly impacting the successful resolution of a case. If an examiner fails to recognize the pertinence of an item on scene, the analyst's theory regarding the crime will be limited. Conversely, unselective evidence collection will most likely include irrelevant material, thus increasing a forensic laboratory's backlog and potentially sending the investigation into an unproductive and costly direction. Therefore, it is critical that analysts recognize and properly evaluate forensic evidence that can assess the relative support of differing hypotheses related to event reconstruction. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to determine if quantitative eye tracking data and qualitative reconstruction accuracy could be used to distinguish investigator expertise. In order to assess this, 32 participants were successfully recruited and categorized as experts or trained novices based on their practical experiences and educational backgrounds. Each volunteer then processed a mock crime scene while wearing a mobile eye tracker, wherein visual fixations, durations, search patterns, and reconstruction accuracy were evaluated. The eye tracking data (dwell time and task percentage on areas of interest or AOIs) were compared using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Needleman–Wunsch (N–W) algorithm, revealing significant group differences for both search duration (EMD), as well as search sequence (N–W). More specifically, experts exhibited greater dissimilarity in search duration, but greater similarity in search sequences than their novice counterparts. In addition to the quantitative visual assessment of examiner variability, each participant's reconstruction skill was assessed using a 22-point binary scoring system, in which significant group differences were detected as a function of total reconstruction accuracy. This result, coupled with the fact that the study failed to detect a significant difference between the groups when evaluating the total time needed to complete the investigation, indicates that experts are more efficient and effective. Finally, the results presented here provide a basis for continued research in the use of eye trackers to assess expertise in complex and distributed environments, including suggestions for future work, and cautions regarding the degree to which visual attention can infer cognitive understanding. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethnic organized crime is a phenomenon that has been largely ignored by social scientists and historians, and dismissed as a subject not to be taken too seriously by those researching the mobility patterns of their own ethnic ancestors or current minority newcomers. The Crooked Ladder represents a groundbreaking attempt to describe how some members of ethnic minorities have utilized organized crime as one vehicle of upward mobility, advancing from lower-class status to middle-class power and respectability.O'Kane illustrates the criminal road to prosperity as a process of displacement and succession: each group competes with and eventually eliminates its more established predecessor from the upper echelons of organized crime. This historical criminal succession mirrors the upward mobility of the Irish, Jews, and Italians in the larger, conventional noncriminal realm. Arguing that African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics are pursuing similar criminal routes, O'Kane takes issue with contemporary social scientists who view the current plight of minorities as unique in American social life.As a fundamental rethinking of the American ethnic experience with crime, The Crooked Ladder will be essential reading for social historians, sociologists, and criminologists. Now available in paperback, it will be useful in criminology courses and well as classes in ethnicity and social relations. © 1992 by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.

AB  - Culprits' identification by the means of suspicious pattern detection techniques from mobile device data is one of the most important aims of the mobile forensic data analysis. When criminal activities are related to entirely automated procedures such as malware propagation, predicting the corresponding behavior is a rather achievable task. However, when human behavior is involved, such as in cases of traditional crimes, prediction and detection become more compelling. This paper introduces a combined criminal profiling and suspicious pattern detection methodology for two criminal activities with moderate to the heavy involvement of mobile devices, cyberbullying and low-level drug dealing. Neural and Neurofuzzy techniques are applied on a hybrid original and simulated dataset. The respective performance results are measured and presented, the optimal technique is selected, and the scenarios are re-run on an actual dataset for additional testing and verification. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this fast growing era of modern technology, it has become important need for people to communicate with each other. Various mediums like social media are used for communication business, organizational details, etc. Due to the increase in technology, there are chances of performing the crimes in newer ways. Using these Social Networking Sites (SNS), many criminal activities have the ability to extract the information. Such activities are spamming, cyber prediction, cyber threatening, killing, blackmailing, phishing, etc. The suspicious messages can be transferred via different SNS, mobile phones, or other sources. Most of the crime-related activities on information on a web are in text format, which is tedious task to trace those criminal activities. Detecting and exploring the crime and identifying the criminals are involved in the analyzing “crime process.” Criminology is a field of using text mining techniques that describe the complexity of relationship between crime datasets. Text mining technique is an effective way to detect and predict criminal activities. Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information or knowledge or patterns from the unstructured text that are from different sources. Since this uses text mining algorithm to continuously check for suspicious words even if they are in short forms or phrases, then they find social graph of users. In this framework, n-gram technique with SCHITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm is used to find suspected message, user, sessions, etc. Information can be extracted using social graph-based text mining, and also the suspected user’s profile has been found. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The discipline of mobile forensics (MF) has undoubtedly shown significant growth during the past few years. Research has advanced from data acquisition techniques to evidence representation methodologies, advanced evidence parsing, and data analysis automation. As technology evolves and functionalities of mobile devices extend to other environments (cloud, Internet of Things, wearable devices, enterprise mobility management with bring your own device [BYOD] support), the probability of their involvement in crimes increases, with their portability and the data types they are storing being potential causes among others. Mobile devices nowadays serve multiple purposes simultaneously, varying from personal use to performance of business transactions, thus exchanging and saving big data quantities. Such a combination of data variety and quantity is rendering the extraction of conclusions during a forensic investigation more difficult than it used to be when mobile devices were not interoperating with many different environments. In this chapter, we are proposing a high-level outline of a multivariate inference system consisting of mobile forensic data from various sources, such as the devices themselves, cloud services, and different sensors. We are using logical rules so as to combine different data features and reach conclusions based on real-life scenarios. Moreover, we are testing two different fuzzy system membership functions in order to define the more suitable for our system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt toward the creation of a semi-automatic fuzzy inference system, which uses forensically acquired data. Previous automation attempts in the field are related to text clustering and classification of network attacks based on their severity and the number of network nodes involved. Neither binary nor text values are convenient for forensic data representation purposes. On the one hand, binary state representations are limited and cannot depict a situation at its whole. On the other hand, text-based solutions are semantics-associated, which, despite being useful, are out of the scope of this chapter and have been researched extensively. We are using the approach of assigning fuzzy values of different scaling to text variables with fixed values and then proceed to rule generation. The goal of the presented system is not to replace human expertise, but to facilitate investigations by acting as an experienced advisor, by using information to the maximum possible extent. Forensic data analysis upon post-criminal activity is actually an auditing procedure aiming to discover the guilty entities, by observing data usage patterns, which can be used as feed for detection methods in intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and serve for continuous performance improvement. However, this cooperation is not unidirectional. IDS logging also offers forensic mechanisms useful insights toward investigation discoveries. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC CRC Press is an imprint of Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.

AB  - Consumerization of IT has introduced multidimensional social changes which require a mature security response that is risk-based and demands a high degree of sophistication. As technologies became democratized and societies got equipped with a plethora of high-potential technologies with which to access the Cyber-Space at any time, communication and action patterns would thoroughly change and alter our spheres of professional and private life, agenda setting, political participation, and behavioral patterns. While security issues are being put on the back burner, cyber-rebels and cyber-criminals grow in numbers. New risks and challenges ensue from this. Therefore, this chapter assesses potential advantages and risks of the Cyber-Space in terms of Cyber-Democracy and Cyber-Crime, inclusive of the latest trend of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD). It illustrates that cyber-democratic action and participation are wide concepts that extend beyond classical definitions of democratic participation and emphasizes the importance of bottom-up mobilization and agenda-setting. At the same time, it underlines how freedom of expression and Cyber-Crime interact by using the example of hacktivism and the hacker movement Anonymous. Even if technological (device management) methods and strategies may help cope with these challenges, they are not an entirely technical issue. This is illustrated by the trend of Bring-Your-Own-Device, where issues at stake also concern legal questions as well as psychological ones (awareness, negligence, and willingness to face existing challenges). Therefore, this chapter also pays attention to the manifold legal issues which have been unsolved so far and urges for legal measures to fill the existing gaps and loopholes pointed to. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Suspect mobility prediction enables proactive experiences for location-aware crime investigations and offers essential intelligence to the crime initiative prevention. Recent practical studies and Rational Choice Theory suggest that the crime suspect mobility is predictable. The previous approaches for suspect location prediction focused on the forecasting the spatial likelihood of anchor point (i.e. the residential or future offending place) for a suspect who committed a series of crimes. However, the monitoring data are usually poor in availability for tracking suspects. Thus, the existing methodologies failed to capture the complex social location transition patterns for suspects and lacked the capacity to address the mobility data scarcity issue. Therefore, it is intractable to reflect suspects mobility patterns from sparse monitoring data, which reduces the effectiveness of case analysis and crime risk prediction. To address this challenge, we presented a novel Crime Records enhanced Location Prediction (CReLP) model. By merging the historical crime cases information by a collaborative filtering process, the CReLP model the estimate the visiting intensity at any arbitrary spatiotemporal node for and individual suspect. Particularly, we first obtained basic spatial and temporal units by partitioning the target areas into 100×100 2D grids and segmenting the daytime into 24 time bins. Second, we built a 3D tensor to model the social mobilities of all suspects with each entry in it representing the visiting intensity at each location and each time bin for each suspect. Meanwhile, this approach employed two matrices to express general movement trends among all suspects. Third, we created a suspect-correlation matrix relying on the spatial and temporal proximities of their historical crime events, as well as the similarities between their personal properties. At last, the missing entries in the 3D tensor were filled through the joint decomposition across all tensors and matrices mentioned above. This way were able to uncover the spatial distribution pattern for each suspect at any time. We evaluated the CReLP model using a real-world suspect mobility dataset collected from 241 suspects over 6 months with about 19 thousand location records. The results showed that our model outperformed three baseline approaches by 32% to 63% at RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and 14% to 26% in TMSD (Top- k Minimum Search Distance), respectively. Finally, a suspect's visiting spatial distributions of the ground truth and predicting results between 8 to 12 a.m. were illustrated to show the performance of our proposed model. © 2018, Science Press.

AB  - Personal identification is very vital in this digital era for simpler mobile phone unlocking to criminal identification in the scene of crime. There are various methods of personal identification ranging from non-invasive methods of presence of moles in the visible parts of the body to the invasive DNA karyotyping. Other in the spectrum being fingerprinting, lip print, foot print, tongue print, palate print etc. As age advances there might be slight variations in finger print, ear biometric etc, where as in iris the amount of pigmentation might vary but the pattern remains almost same from birth to death, unless otherwise there is any injury to the iris which is very remote. Iris pattern recognition is a non-invasive method of biometric identification. Iris architecture is not only complex but also unique to an individual. In this article a methodology is been proposed to match iris pattern. © BEIESP.

AB  - Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders’ crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times. Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models. Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime. Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The flourishing of social networking applications (SNA) in recent years has revolutionized the way we live. On the other hand, SNA are also used for malicious activities. Identifying the physical person behind a SNA account is a challenge task in investigations of SNA-involved criminal cases. As one way to address this challenge, automatic user attribute inference, which is also referred to as user profiling, has become an increasingly attractive research topic. However, existing methods may suffer from problems such as low quality content and complex social networks. The increasing amounts of user-generated geolocation data on SNA give rise to new opportunities for user profiling. In this paper, we study the problem of user profiling with user-generated geolocation data. Specifically, we take occupation profiling as an entry point. We design a supervised occupation classification framework and propose two categories of geolocation-based features, i.e., mobility pattern features (MPF) and location preference features (LPF). Experiments performed using real-world SNA data reveal that LPF can indicate the occupation to a certain extent and are more efficient than word count features and TF-IDF features. Moreover, it is also revealed that good occupation profiling accuracy can be achieved by integrating LPF and LDA topic features inferred from text content. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Historical documents record the operation of a silver mine from the 16th century AD located near the former village of Salberget in central Sweden. The historical record describes several categories of inhabitants, including local families, workers and miners, foreign engineers and mining specialists, as well as war captives and criminals used as forced labor in the mines. A church yard in the vicinity of the village served as a burial ground. Archaeological evidence indicates two distinct grave types (coffin and earthen) and physical anthropology documents differences in age and sex between these grave types, as well as harsh conditions of life. Strontium and oxygen isotopes have been used previously to investigate the place of origin of the cemetery inhabitants and clear differences among the types of graves were seen in the isotope results. Place of origin was more difficult to ascertain however. Here we utilize lead isotopes as an additional isotopic tracer to identify origins. The lead isotope investigations pinpoint several areas outside of the Sala region where some of the inhabitants originated. In addition, the study documents the benefits of using lead isotopes in human proveniencing studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article explains temporal variation in repression as a function of the “dissident calendar,” the set of events that serve as natural focal points for coordination. The core argument is that regimes can anticipate the events that create these focal points and engage in preemptive repression to survive their passing. This dynamic produces predictable, often cyclical patterns in repression. An analysis of dissident detentions in China from 1998 to 2014 shows that “focal events” alone appear to be responsible for more than 20 percent of dissident detentions over the analysis period. Such detentions tend to be shorter and rely less on formal criminal procedures, suggesting a “catch-and-release” dynamic. Additional analysis of detentions in Tibet shows how the calendar may vary by issue or group. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The relationship between a parent and a child is without any doubt one of the most influential and intimate relationships over the life course of an individual. Children resemble their parents in a variety of life outcomes such as socioeconomic status, family formation characteristics, and political views. There is growing evidence that some families - despite interventions by child protection services, judicial sanctions, and social mobility - are stuck in patterns of criminal behaviour, poverty, substance abuse, teenage parenthood, and other negative life events. This is a growing global problem for which currently no solution is available. This book brings together the most important and unique findings of intergenerational studies of criminal behaviour from around the world, and from a variety of disciplines, from criminology to sociology to anthropology. Each chapter explores the historical background of a specific study, its most important objectives, and the unique conclusions and implications that can be drawn from the data. Essential reading for all those interested in criminal behaviour, psychological criminology, and intergenerational psychology, this book provides an extensive overview of intergenerational studies on patterns of continuity and discontinuity of criminal, antisocial, or delinquent behaviour, as well as related behaviours or risk factors such as the intergenerational continuities in (harsh) parenting and family relationship quality. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Veroni I.

AB  - Crime is unevenly distributed in space. This chapter discusses the uneven spatial patterns in crime from an offender decision-making perspective. It describes the main theoretical perspectives in environmental criminology (the rational choice perspective, routine activity approach, and crime pattern theory) and reviews the empirical research with an emphasis on studies that have used a discrete spatial choice framework for analyzing individual crime location choices. The strength of the discrete spatial choice framework, several of its assumptions, and its link with random utility maximization theory are discussed. The chapter concludes with several challenges for future crime location choice research, including challenges regarding temporal aspects of criminal decision making, planned versus opportunistic crimes, and solved versus unsolved crimes. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - The importance of space and place in criminology has been known for almost 200 years. The overarching pattern of this research is that, despite the various motivations for crime, crime is patterned across space and those crime patterns are stable over time. Consequently, understanding the nature of those spatial patterns is critical for understanding crime. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new set of theories emerged to explain the spatial patterns of crime: routine activity theory, geometry of crime and rational choice theory - collectively known as environmental criminology. Routine activity theory, developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson, states that in order to have a criminal event, a motivated offender and a suitable target must converge in space and time in the absence of a capable guardian. The origins of the contemporary theories within environmental criminology are largely related to, or became associated with, crime prevention. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Avi Brisman, Eamonn Carrabine and Nigel South; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - In this study, an assessment of e-waste management in Chandigarh, India was done. A structured questionnaire based survey was used to know about various socio-economic characteristics. Based on the results, the quantification of, equipment wise, e-waste generation and their distinctive disposal patterns were acquired. Future, e-waste generation was also estimated using an approach investigated by Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit and Manufacturer’s Association of Information Technology (GTZ-MAIT). The total amount of e-waste generation from households of Chandigarh was found out to be 3276.47 tons/annum, which was equivalent to 3.1 kg/capita/annum. It was also found that most of the e-waste generated was from the use of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) such as Mobile phones, Laptops, Cameras, Washing machines, Air conditioners, Heaters, Geysers, LEDs and LCDs. Moreover, taking the annual GDP growth rate of India into account e-waste generation from households was estimated to reach 9565.1 tons/annum by 2020. Among the various disposal channels “selling as scrap” was the most favored one among the respondents to discard the used EEE. Therefore, it can be concluded from the survey that informal sectors or scrap dealers are very active in e-waste collection as they are aware about the profitability from its dismantling and recycling. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - If institutions are important for regulating violence, can institutional reforms make societies less violent? This article examines the north-east Brazilian state of Pernambuco primarily between 2007 and 2013, proposing that patterns of declining lethal violence can be explained by changes in both the accountability and effectiveness of formal state institutions and informal social norms. Drawing on two months of qualitative fieldwork, findings suggest that social and political mobilisation enabled a political coalition to initiate substantial changes under the Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life) public-security programme, which improved the legitimacy and operational effectiveness of the criminal justice system, and coincided with a marked reduction in homicide rates. While showing that these reforms were central in reducing lethal violence in Pernambuco between 2007 and 2013, the article concludes by discussing the challenges of policy continuity in light of increasing rates of lethal violence since 2014.

AB  - This paper explores the effect that municipal policing can exert on politics, and specifically investigates the effect that Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) policing has had on voter turnout and candidate choice in New York City. While extant studies of the American criminal justice system have found that mass incarceration and felon disenfranchisement negatively impact political participation and engagement, few have explicitly explored policing’s relationship with politics and fewer still consider its mobilizing potential. Mobilizing data from over 2.7 million geo-coded police stops and data from a series of national and municipal elections this paper uncovers a pattern of voter demobilization, voter mobilization, and candidate choice that cannot be anticipated from extant studies in the literature. Specifically, it finds that while concentrated policing was associated with reductions in voter turnout in the 2006 and 2010 midterm elections, it was associated with higher rates of turnout in the 2008 presidential election and 2013 Democratic primary and general mayor. Further analysis demonstrates that stopping intensity was strongly associated with candidate choice in the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary, such that higher rates of policing were positively associated with support for the candidate (John Liu) who advocated for eliminating SQF and less support for the candidate (William Thompson) who supported SQF. Together, these findings highlight the impact that policing can exert on political behavior, characterize the impact that harmful policing policies can play in instigating policing participation and engagement, and foreground the importance of considering local criminal justice policy and political action. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. © Mangai Natarajan 2011.

AB  - This paper aims to consider the conceptual context in which psychiatry is situated when it faces to culturally oriented offense, as in the case of psychiatric evaluation as part of the criminal trial. The starting point of the psychiatric science is the concept of normality and his goal is to analyze and classify patterns of behavior. It is an historical concept (in time and space) and, as such, strongly conditioned by culture, customs and, nonetheless, traditions. Globalization -whose indicator is the widespread mobility of people in spacedetermines many problems when it comes to define the content of normal behavior, especially when we try to compare the content of prevalent behavior with behavior patterns of people belonging to cultural minorities. © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - This study—based on a national data set (N = 1,447)—focuses on extrafamilial sexual assaults and their mobility. Spatial information about the offender’s house, the victim’s house, and the crime scene was combined in mobility crime triangles. The findings reveal that most of the assaults fall in the categories of total mobility (42.78%) and offender mobility (33.10%). Our results also show the validity of the distance decay function with over 50% of aggressions occurring within 3 km of the offender’s house. The analysis did not reveal the existence of buffer zones, probably due to the acquaintance between some of the offenders and their victims. The evidence suggests that environmental risk factors are more significant than individual ones when it comes to explaining the variation among mobility patterns in sexual assaults. Offenders appear to adapt their mobility patterns and modus operandi according to the environmental constraints. Often, offenders choose their own or their victim’s house as a safe environment for performed sexual assault. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This chapter explores the paradigmatic case of Michoacan, Mexico, a model transnational state with intense social and economic interconnections with the United States suffering very high levels of violence. It investigates how insecurity resulting from criminal-related activities and the concomitant reaction on the part of the Mexican state and self-defense groups has forcibly displaced thousands of people, critically reshaping the state's migration patterns, such as with the rise of internal displacement. Relying on interviews with migrant authorities and representatives of civil society both in Mexico and the United States, this chapter traces the effect that violence is having on traditional migration patterns showing how an important number of uprooted Michoacanos have attempted to migrate north using existing transnational migration networks. The analysis thus underscores the complex intermestic dimension that human mobility is attaining in the North American corridor. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine the repeat residential burglars' target selection behaviors. The data consisted of variables relating to target selection behaviors and decision making of 104 serial residential burglars, who had arrest records for residential burglaries in the past. The results of multiple correspondence analysis revealed that residential burglars' target selection behaviors could be differentiated into three styles: “burgling in the absence of residents”, “burgling in the presence of residents while they are sleeping at night”, and “burgling of mixed styles”. Among 14 variables relating to burglars' decision making while committing crimes, three factors (risk/reward-oriented, traceless entry-oriented, low effort area-oriented) were extracted by exploratory factor analysis. The level of burgling skill evaluated by the suspect interviewers positively correlated with a factor score of the “risk/reward-oriented” factor (ρ = .20, p < .05) but negatively correlated with a factor score of the “low effort area-oriented” factor (ρ = - .24, p < .05). These results suggest that repeat residential burglars are rational decision makers, but the way they are rational varies. © 2019 Japanese Psychological Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Allergen is an umbrella term for irritants of diverse origin. Along with other offenders such as pathogens, mutagens, xenobiotics, and pollutants, allergens can be grouped as inflammatory agents. Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are altered metabolism products of necrotic or stressed cells, which are deemed as alarm signals by the innate immune system. Like inflammation, DAMPs play a role in correcting the altered physiological state, but in excess, they can be lethal due to their signal transduction roles. In a vicious loop, inflammatory agents are DAMP generators and DAMPs create a pro-inflammatory state. Only a handful of DAMPs such as uric acid, mtDNA, extracellular ATP, HSPs, amyloid β, S100, HMGB1, and ECM proteins have been studied till now. A large number of DAMPs are still obscure, in need to be unveiled. The identification and functional characterization of those DAMPs in inflammation pathways can be insightful. Recent Findings: As inflammation and immune activation have been implicated in almost all pathologies, studies on them have been intensified in recent times. Consequently, the pathologic mechanisms of various DAMPs have emerged. Following PRR ligation, the activation of inflammasome, MAPK, and NF-kB is some of the common pathways. Summary: The limited number of recognized DAMPs are only a fraction of the vast array of other DAMPs. In fact, any misplaced or abnormal level of metabolite can be a DAMP. Sophisticated analysis studies can reveal the full profile of the DAMPs. Lowering the level of DAMPs is useful therapeutic intervention but certainly not as effective as avoiding the DAMP generators, i.e., the inflammatory agents. So, rather than mitigating DAMPs, efforts should be focused on the elimination of inflammatory agents. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To identify and compare the space–time patterns of vehicle thefts and the effects of associated environmental factors, this paper conducts a case study of the Pudong New Area (PNA), a major urban district in Shanghai, China’s largest city. Geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis indicated that there was a stable pattern of vehicle theft over time. Hotspots of vehicle theft across different time periods were identified. These data provide clues for how law enforcement can prioritize the deployment of limited patrol and investigative resources. Vehicle thefts, especially those of non-motor vehicles, tend to be concentrated in the central-western portion of the PNA, which experienced a dramatic rate of urbanization and has a high concentration of people and vehicles. Important factors contributing to vehicle thefts include a highly mobile and transitory population, a large population density, and high traffic volume. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study represents an effort to investigate the age pattern of criminal involvement from an economist's perspective. It presents a dynamic stochastic model of sequential search and match evaluation which is used to explain the reasons for, and the timing of, the decision to terminate a criminal career. The behavioral implications derived from the theoretical model are tested using individual National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Estimation results strongly support the prediction of a negative relation between theoption value of retaining a criminal career and desistance decisions. More specifically, the effects of current and future expected criminal earnings are shown to be negative, substantial, and statistically significant in determining desistance probabilities. Retiring behavior is also significantly responsive to variables measuring personal costs of punishment and the availability and attractiveness of a legal income-generating activity in ways consistent with theoretical expectations. © 2000 Stephen Farrall.

AB  - This article examines the settings for frauds in the context of crime networks, fraud opportunities and of a victim-centric typology of fraud. It demonstrates the variety of actors, settings and the variable need for knowing collaboration between co-offenders in frauds of different types. It explores what is known about those involved in the organization of some forms of frauds; how they find both co-offenders and victims in face-to-face and remote settings; and the barriers to growth of the 'fraud business'. It concludes that the globalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between settings, with their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns of business, consumer and investment activities), the variable abilities of would-be perpetrators to recognize and act on those opportunities (the 'crime scripts' perspective), and their interactions with controls (including, but not restricted to, law enforcement). Constructs of 'organized crime' are becoming less obsessed with the structure of groups than with what people need from the largely illicit and largely licit worlds before they commit fraud. Although some frauds are committed by generic transnational 'organized crime' networks, others are merely mobile small groups or individuals who can transplant techniques wherever they go; and others still commit very large one-off frauds without a need for long-term or any involvement in 'organized crime'. © Nikos Passas 2013.

AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences. © 2019

AB  - In an era of mass mobility, those who are permitted to migrate and those who are criminalized, controlled, and prohibited from migrating are heavily patterned by race. By placing race at the centre of its analysis, this volume brings together fourteen essays that examine, question, and explain the growing intersection between criminal justice and migration control. Through the lens of race, we see how criminal justice and migration enmesh in order to exclude, stop, and excise racialized citizens and non-citizens from societies across the world within, beyond, and along borders. Neatly organized in four parts, the book begins with chapters that present a conceptual analysis of race, borders, and social control, moving to the institutions that make up and shape the criminal justice and migration complex. The remaining chapters are convened around the key sites where criminal justice and migration control intersect: policing, courts, and punishment. Together the volume presents a critical and timely analysis of how race shapes and complicates mobility and how racism is enabled and reanimated when criminal justice and migration control coalesce. Race and the meaning of race in relation to citizenship and belonging are excavated throughout the chapters presented in the book, thereby transforming the way we think about migration. © The several contributors 2017.

AB  - Relying on rational choice theory, we compare burglars’ varying levels of offense planning to understand differences among types of burglars. Surveys were collected from a sample of incarcerated male and female burglars in three states. Participants answered questions detailing aspects of a burglary including motivations, target selection, deterrents, and techniques. Comparisons were made between 119 deliberate (32%) and 257 impulsive (68%) burglars. Deliberate burglars focused on obtaining cash, whereas impulsive burglars were more motivated by drug habits. Impulsive burglars were more easily dissuaded from a target when multiple obstacles are present. Burglars consider how many obstacles they may have to overcome, providing support for rational choice-based, situational crime prevention efforts. Differences in burglar motivation emerged and are discussed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Healthcare data are attractive to cyber-criminals because they contain financial and personal data, can be used for blackmail, and most valuable, are ideal for fraudulent billing. They are also remarkably vulnerable to penetration because of the fluid and always-evolving nature of a patient's medical care and because of the number of clinicians, facilities and transactions required to connect patient care across multiple settings. The addition of mobile healthcare devices and connected healthcare delivery systems (e.g., wearables, monitoring devices, cell phone images) makes healthcare data more attractive but also more vulnerable. Wide variations of digital health use patterns complicates design security solutions for each context or clinician. In this paper we propose a set of connected healthcare patterns, and then discuss security challenges and potential solutions for each of the connected health patterns. © 2019 American Psychological Association Inc.

AB  - Mobile networks and smart phones have become ubiquitous in our daily life. Large amount of customer related telecom data from various sources are generated every day, from which diversified behavior patterns can be revealed, including some anomalous behaviors that are vicious. It becomes increasingly important to achieve both efficient and effective customer behavior analysis based on the telecom big data. In this paper, the Multi-faceted Telecom Customer Behavior Analysis (MTCBA) framework for anomalous telecom customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is proposed. In this framework, we further design the hierarchical Locality Sensitive Hashing-Local Outlier Factor (hierarchical LSH-LOF) scheme for suspicious customer detection, and the Autoencoders with Factorization Machines (FM-AE) structure for dimension reduction to achieve more efficient clustering. Hierarchical LSH-LOF is an improved algorithm of LOF, in which we design a hierarchical LSH process that selects the approximate k nearest neighbors from coarse to fine by gradually narrowing down the scope. Experiments show its superiority over KD-tree w.r.t searching speed. FM-AE exploits Factorization Machines for learning second order feature interactions, which we prove to be useful by designing comparative experiments with five dimension reduction algorithms. With the proposed MTCBA framework, efficient and effective telecom customer behavior analysis including anomalous customer behavior detection and clustering analysis is performed on the real world telecom operating data provided by one of the major Internet service providers (ISPs) in China. Meanwhile, interpretable clustering results of six clusters are obtained to provide valuable information for the precision marketing of telecom operators, criminal combating, and social credit system construction. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Early research on mobile phone adoption among fishers followed an economistic perspective, focusing mainly on access to market price information. Researchers called for investigations into collective and cooperative uses of the technology. Responding to these calls, we explored Burmese fishers’ use of mobile phones in the realms of social life and business, mainly related to information seeking and sharing among the community. Interviews with 23 fishers in three regions in Myanmar suggested that both social and commercial, as well as individual- and community-oriented, uses were prevalent. Mobile phones helped channel information on price and market demand among a limited number of fishers, especially the boat owners and fish dealers. The other segments in the fishing labor hierarchy desisted from individual ownership of the phone, while opting for a more community-based appropriation. A nuanced picture of use and non-use of mobiles emerged alongside fishers’ socio-economic status and patterns of fishing. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The past decade has seen increased reports of street gangs across a range of contexts. In Europe, anxieties over street-based youth has led to the development of gang-specific policies across a range of jurisdictions, most notably the UK. Following a similar pattern of policy mobility in criminal justice, many of these policies have origins in the US system. In this review of international gang policy developments, we critically examine a number of these policies in a comparative context - including gang policing units and intelligence databases - and interrogate their efficacy. Drawing on cogent examples from the UK, we argue for caution in adopting US gang intervention tactics due to the lack of empirical evidence relating to their applicability or efficacy, and the corresponding potential for discrimination toward the most marginalised and socially excluded children and young people in society. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and National Children's Bureau

AB  - Crime analysts and law enforcement agencies can formulate effective strategies utilizing current crime trends and patterns. Modern computational technologies, particularly big data analysis and visualization can be applied to available crime data and other resources. Visual analytics, an analytical reasoning technique with interactive visual interfaces, is a powerful tool that serves to augment the trend and pattern recognition capabilities of experts. This paper introduces a three-dimensional (3D) visual analytics framework that interactively visualizes crime data and other relevant datasets on a highly accurate 3D model of the City of Vancouver, Canada. This 3D visualization advances crime analysis activities through a more accurate display of the area under study. The 3D visual analytics can improve identification of temporal and spatial criminal areas and provide strategic and effective plans for pro-active police deployment. The open data catalogue from the City of Vancouver, Canada and the Vancouver Police Department open source property crime data were used in this study. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose People with mental illnesses are at a significantly greater risk of police arrest than the general population. This pattern of arrests has been associated with a phenomenon referred to as the criminalization of mental illness such that people with mental illnesses are inappropriately diverted to the criminal justice system rather than to treatment. To decrease arrests of people with mental illnesses experiencing a crisis, pre-booking diversion programs have been developed to intervene at the point of police contact. This systematic literature review examines the state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs by addressing the question, “What is the evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in reducing arrests (i.e., reducing criminalization) of people with mental illnesses?” Methods Systematic literature searches of seven databases were performed during May 2017. The searches sought to identify studies that examined the effectiveness of pre-booking diversion programs in decreasing arrests. A multi-phase screening process was completed independently by two pairs of reviewers as well as a risk of bias review. Results A total of 2,750 unique citations were identified. Of these, 4 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria; all were from the US. Three of the studies examined the effectiveness of Crisis Intervention Teams and one study looked at a mobile crisis program. Two of the studies were at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk. Conclusions This review indicates that this line of inquiry is still developing. There are a number of gaps yet to be filled. The current evidence for the effectiveness of police-based pre-booking diversion programs in reducing arrests (i.e., reducing criminalization) of people with mental illnesses is limited. However, these studies indicate there is moderate evidence that these programs increase linkages to mental health services. © 2018 Dewa et al.

AB  - At the end of 2015, there were 4.7 billion noteworthy mobile subscribers globally, equivalent to 63% of the world‟s population. Mobile phones had all the essential components or characteristics neatly fitted into a small space and designed to achieve high speeds, massive storage, and increased functionalities. Smart phones used to carry out imparting or exchanging of information such as calling, texting, Internet browsing, e-mail, photos, videos, and etc. Criminals can use smart phones for a number of activities. Namely, committing a fraud over e-mail, harassment via text messages, drug trafficking, child pornography, etc. In this research paper, We demonstrate, if a mobile phone is identified in a criminal activity and if it is locked by any one of the locking mechanisms such as pattern lock, PIN lock and password lock, then how to unlock the mobile device without data loss for forensic examination. It is a great challenge for forensic experts to extract data from a mobile phone for forensic purpose that can be used as evidence in the court of law. The experimental results show that our approach can break all kinds of pattern locks. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article shows a novel geo-visualization method of dynamic spatiotemporal data that allows mobility and concentration of criminal activity to be study. The method was developed using, only and significantly, real data of Santiago de Cali (Colombia), collected by the Colombian National Police (PONAL). This method constitutes a tool that allows criminal influx to be analyzed by concentration, zone, time slot and date. In addition to the field experience of police commanders, it allows patterns of criminal activity to be detected, thereby enabling a better distribution and management of police resources allocated to crime deterrence, prevention and control. Additionally, it may be applied to the concepts of safe city and smart city of the PONAL within the architecture of Command and Control System (C2S) of Command and Control Centers for Public Safety. Furthermore, it contributes to a better situational awareness and improves the future projection, agility, efficiency and decision-making processes of police officers, which are all essential for fulfillment of police missions against crime. Finally, this was developed using an open source software, it can be adapted to any other city, be used with real-time data and be implemented, if necessary, with the geographic software of any other C2S. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Most overdose fatalities involve opioids, which include prescription medication, heroin, and illicit fentanyl. Current data reveal that the overdose crisis affects all demographic groups and that overdose rates are now rising most rapidly among African Americans. We provide a public health perspective that can be used to mobilize a comprehensive local, state, and national response to the opioid crisis. We argue that framing the crisis from a public health perspective requires considering the interaction of multiple determinants, including structural factors (eg, poverty and racism), the inadequate management of pain, and poor access to addiction treatment and harmreduction services (eg, syringe services). We propose a novel ecological framework for harmful opioid use that provides multiple recommendations to improve public health and clinical practice, including improved data collection to guide resource allocation, steps to increase safer prescribing, stigma-reduction campaigns, increased spending on harm reduction and treatment, criminal justice policy reform, and regulatory changes related to controlled substances. Focusing on these opportunities provides the greatest chance of making a measured and sustained impact on overdose and related harms. © 2018, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

AB  - Mobile phones have become nowadays a commodity to the majority of people. Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice. © Mangai Natarajan 2011.

AB  - In criminal investigations, latent fingerprints are one of the most significant forms of evidence and most commonly used forensic investigation tool worldwide. The existing non-contact latent fingerprint detection systems are bulky, expensive and require environment which is shock and vibration resistant, thereby limiting their usability outside the laboratory. In this article, a compact, full field, low cost technique for profiling of fingerprints using deflectometry is proposed. Using inexpensive mobile phone screen based structured illumination, and windowed Fourier transform (WFT) based phase retrieval mechanism, the 2D and 3D phase plots reconstruct the profile information of the fingerprint. The phase information is also used to confirm a match between two fingerprints in real time. Since the proposed technique is non-interferometric, the measurements are least affected by environmental perturbations. Using the proposed technique, a portable sensor capable of field deployment has been realized. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper proposes a machine learning application to identify mobile phone users suspected of involvement in criminal activities. The application characterizes the behavioral patterns of suspect users versus non-suspect users based on usage metadata such as call duration, call distribution, interaction time preferences and text-to-call ratios while avoiding any access to the content of calls or messages. The application is based on targeted Bayesian network learning method. It generates a graphical network that can be used by domain experts to gain intuitive insights about the key features that can help identify suspect users. The method enables experts to manage the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy using information theory metrics. Unlike other graphical Bayesian classifiers, the proposed application accomplishes the task required of a security company, namely an accurate suspect identification rate (recall) of at least 50% with no more than a 1% false identification rate. The targeted Bayesian network learning method is also used for additional tasks such as anomaly detection, distinction between “relevant” and “irrelevant” anomalies, and for associating anonymous telephone numbers with existing users by matching behavioral patterns. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This article studies how burglars select a house to burglarize. We draw on the rational choice perspective to investigate how burglars select a target by relying on house-related attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk. It extends current applications of the discrete spatial choice framework to burglary target selection by adopting the house as the spatial unit of analysis and studies burglars' target selection process in a larger and more diverse study area than that of earlier studies. Using data on 650 residential burglaries and on approximately 500,000 residential properties in the Belgian province East Flanders, we consider a discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection to establish which house-related attributes influence burglars' target selection process. Our findings demonstrate that terraced houses, houses without a garage, houses that have not been outfitted with a central heating and/or air-conditioning system and houses nearby burglars' residences are more likely to be selected. Overall, our analysis suggests that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets while higher perceived rewards actually decrease the odds of a house being burglarized. Risk-related attributes are unimportant for burglars' target choice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The problems that arise between neighbours have not received the academic scrutiny they deserve despite neighbour problems and disputes appearing to be a growing phenomenon. In this paper, we begin to address this omission by examining the kinds of problems residents in the city of Brisbane, Australia, are likely to encounter with neighbours and identifying patterns in their distribution on the basis of neighbourhood characteristics. Making a distinction between private nuisance problems on the one hand and antisocial and criminal behaviour on the other hand, we observe how neighbourhood levels of concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility and population density all increase the chances of residents encountering a combination of nuisance and antisocial or criminal neighbour problems over nuisance problems only or no problems at all. Conversely, a higher concentration of foreign-born residents is found to be associated with residents being more likely to experience nuisance or no problems over more criminal and antisocial forms. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - According to a rational choice theory of crime location choice, offenders commit crimes at locations where the mix of expected rewards and costs is optimal. The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crime—illicit drug dealing in an open air drug market—and tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for criminological theory and research methods. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Indigenous Australians experience significant social risk, vulnerability and disadvantage. Nowhere is this more starkly demonstrated than in the levels of contact that Indigenous Australians have with the criminal justice system, particularly the police. Utilizing a linked dataset of extant criminal justice, human and health service administrative data in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, this paper explores patterns of police contact and custody for a cohort of Indigenous males with complex needs. Four significant factors are identified that alone or in combination appear to impact on the frequency with which these men experience police contact and custody, including young age at first police contact, experiencing out of home care as a child, alcohol misuse, and limited locational mobility. Whilst it might be expected that the presence of mental ill-health and/or cognitive disability would be a key predictor of the frequency and intensity of police contact and custody, the findings suggest rather that the presence of multiple disadvantages beginning in the early years and compounding throughout individuals' lives, in which mental illness may or may not be a factor, is more significant than the presence of any one diagnosis in precipitating police contact and custody for this group. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Authentication is a crucial consideration when securing data or any kind of information system. Though existing approaches for authentication are user-friendly, they have vulnerabilities such as the possibility & criminally threatening a user. We propose a novel approach which uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals for an authentication process. Unique features of EEG data for distinguishing brain activities can potentially be used to authenticate a user. Compared to other biometric systems, this approach is very robust and more secure because response is significantly changed according to instantaneous mental condition. In the proposed approach, the system user is asked to visualize a number while corresponding EEG signals are captured. Captured signals are used to train the system, compared in the authentication process. This approach mainly focuses on the 8 to 30 Hz Alpha and Beta combined frequency band across all EEG channels, since it is the most appropriate band for EEG signals in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) values were used as main features to train the model. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used as a classification algorithm for a given set of user data. A trained set of models for each user is embedded in the system as a parameter database. Each user selects the profile attached to their trained model before the authentication session. Eventually, a trained model can authenticate a user after memorization of pre-determined four digits which the user is asked to think at the first stage of the process. The maximum accuracy recorded with the existing data was 96.97%. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - As mass storage media is recently becoming more common due to spread of smart phones in which new technologies have been applied, data collected from digital crime has been increased a lot. At the time, if the investigator did not conduct the initial response properly, we may lose the value as the evidence. Thus, the collection of digital evidence in a short time is required. Therefore, this paper proposes the methods to collect data rapidly at the scene of the crime based on table related to criminal charges. Implemented application can collect data with a consideration of each feature of software and provide the rapid results through a pattern search. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - This article explores the conditions that led to the referral of the crisis in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the arrest warrant against Sudan’s President Bashir in 2009. It is argued that a judicial reading of the situation gained prominence, both because of activist mobilisation outside Sudan and because the UN Security Council failed to agree on a more robust “responsibility to protect” approach. The externalisation of the issue of accountability for crimes in Darfur had several consequences. In addition to contributing to a lack of local ownership of justice, the recasting of complex local patterns of conflict in the moral vocabulary of a western judicial system simplified complexities on the ground. The arrest warrant was also issued at a time when international actors were pursuing a number of policy objectives in Sudan, including the implementation of the peace agreement between the government and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM). Combining a confrontational approach with a cooperative one has turned out to be extremely difficult, and the arrest warrant has exposed growing divisions among members of the international community, both regarding the response to atrocities in Darfur and regarding the purpose and priorities of the ICC. © 2013, © Universitetsforlaget 2013.

AB  - Objectives: This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders. Methods: Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders’ spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age. Results: Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders. Conclusions: This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This article analyzes how street robbers decide on where to attack their victims. Using data on nearly 13,000 robberies, on the approximately 18,000 offenders involved in these robberies, and on the nearly 25,000 census blocks in the city of Chicago, we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers. We demonstrate that they attack near their own homes, on easily accessible blocks, where legal and illegal cash economies are present, and that these effects spill over to adjacent blocks. © The Author (2012).

AB  - Time geography offers a rich framework for representing movement across space and time. An extension of time geography to crime mapping, as proposed by the models discussed in this chapter, requires an accounting for victim and offender mobility under event-related constraints (e.g. accessibility to a crime scene). This chapter discusses results from a study that evaluates the usability of 3D space-time cube maps for representing crime patterns. Also considered is the utility of the time-geographic framework for exploring crime events that occur at unknown points in space and time. To this end, this chapter discusses the problem of crime activities that are not amenable to point-based mapping, potential alternative visualization methods using time-geographic techniques, and the procedures and results of usability tests wherein participants were asked to interpret maps that incorporated various time-geographic attributes. The overall purpose of the study was to assess the practicality of using time geography within a crime mapping context. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - The coupling of racial and economic stratification has been found to result in a range of adverse outcomes for youth of color, including disproportionate exposure to violence and victimization. Primary explanations of these patterns, particularly at the micro-level, have focused on the impact of street culture. In this article, we draw from a multiyear ethnography in Cape Town, South Africa, to offer a theoretical elaboration of the place of culture in contributing to victimization risks among urban minority young men. The study is based on data collected from a sample of 26 young men of color who lived on the Cape Flats between 2003 and 2006. Using grounded theory methods, we suggest the import of unequal access to spatial mobility as a multifaceted means by which culture mediates young men's risks for victimization in disadvantaged communities. We find that transitory mobility-conceptualized as youth's temporary access to cultural spaces outside their segregated residential neighborhoods-is an important source of cultural heterogeneity in townships that can intensify the strength of local social identities and outgroup antipathies directed at those whose mobility is perceived as a cultural threat. Transitorily mobile young men's cultural repertoires are a key facet of street efficacy that can either insulate them from risk or heighten their vulnerabilities. Our findings are suggestive of important sources of variation in young men's victimization outcomes in disadvantaged communities, offering insights about factors that shape risks beyond those linked to the victim-offender overlap in high-risk settings. © 2013 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Interest in data-driven crime simulations has been growing in recent years, confirming its potential to advance crime prevention and prediction. Especially, the use of new data sources in crime simulation models can contribute towards safer and smarter cities. Previous work on agent-based models for crime simulations have intended to simulate offender behavior in a geographical environment, relying exclusively on a small sample of offender homes and crime locations. The complex dynamics of crime and the lack of information on criminal offender’s movement patterns challenge the design of offender movement in simulations. At the same time, the availability of big, GPS-based user data samples (mobile data, social media data, etc.) already allowed researchers to determine the laws governing human mobility patterns, which, we argue, could inform offender movement. In this paper, we explore: (1) the use of location-based venue data from Foursquare in New York City (NYC), and (2) human dynamics insights from previous studies to simulate offender movement. We study 9 offender mobility designs in an agent-based model, combining search distances strategies (static, uniform distributed, and Lévy-flight approximation) and target selection algorithms (random intersection, random Foursquare venues, and popular Foursquare venues). The offender behavior performance is measured using the ratio of crime locations passed vs average distance traveled by each offender. Our initial results show that agents moving between POI perform best, while the performance of the three search distance strategies is similar. This work provides a step forward towards more realistic crime simulations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Cybercrime is a significantly new phenomenon, which is facilitated by the internet. The internet not only makes it much easier for malware authors or hackers to bypass national boundaries, but also offer more sophisticated techniques to support malicious program creation for malware authors. This paper outlines an observation from Taiwan malware authors in past decades. The case description and author behavior in rational choice theories is discussed. The goal is to analyze their mentality and thinking patterns from a standpoint of rational choice theory. Profit emerges as a main factor in repeat offenders. They freely choose to write malicious programs after rational evaluation where the anticipated costs and the expected benefits are weighed against each other. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - The decade leading up to South Africa’s first universal democratic elections in April 1994 was characterised by increasing violence. A systematic study of South Africa’s current history reveals that the government’s repressive policies during apartheid and the political rivalry among different political parties notably ANC and IFP during transition, had provided a fertile ground for the emergence of the culture of violence. In fact, this culture of violence continues to persist in post-apartheid South Africa even after almost two decades of rule of the democratic government. Moreover, high levels of corruption and links between criminal gangs and government officials in the post-apartheid period has worsened the condition in South Africa. This article is an attempt to explore the root cause of violence in South Africa and to find out government’s links, if any, with such violence during apartheid, transition and the post-apartheid period. Besides, the article examines the changing patterns of violence and public perceptions in South Africa after the end of apartheid. © 2012 African Studies Association of India.

AB  - The aim of this study was to make a head start with unveiling transnational spatial patterns in offending. To that end, data are used from DNA profile exchange between The Netherlands and 18 other EU member states that have implemented EU legislation on forensic cooperation. Information was collected on all DNA stains entered into the database, including the region in The Netherlands where the stain was secured, the type of crime and how many matching DNA profiles had been identified in each of the other 18 countries. The results suggest that currently the profiles of offenders who are active in other Prüm countries make up for about 4 per cent of all DNA stain profiles in the Dutch DNA database. The highest share of cross-border matches is found in the southeastern part of The Netherlands, where The Netherlands borders one of the most densely populated regions of Germany. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Criminal victimization is known to influence households' moving decisions, but theories suggest that the processes leading to a moving decision can vary across racial and ethnic groups. Drawing from current literature, we hypothesized that victimization would have a stronger effect on moving decisions for Whites than for Blacks or Hispanics, and that racial/ethnic residential segregation would moderate the impact of victimization on mobility. Using a longitudinal sample of 34,134 housing units compiled from the National Crime Victimization Survey for the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States (1995-2003), we found results that both support and contradict the hypotheses. Specifically, White residents display consistent evidence that victimization is a significant predictor of household mobility. Blacks and Hispanics, in contrast, are more varied in their moving behavior after victimization. In addition, significant differences exist among these groups in responses to victimization and in how mobility is influenced by residential segregation. Higher levels of residential segregation play a part in the victimization-mobility relationship among Blacks in a way that is more complex than we hypothesized. © 2014 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterning of arson incidents in a large urban county. Methods: Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space–time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy. Results: Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons. Conclusions: Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this “invisible” Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment. Results may aid in inductive theory building as well as efforts to investigate and prevent arson. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - This article provides an in-depth literature review of the different trends and debates in the English academic literature on the violent conflicts in the North Caucasus during the post-Soviet period. This literature review is separated into three major debates and focused on four major themes that consistently appear in the study of violent conflicts in the North Caucasus: nationalism and identity (grievance), criminality and opportunism (greed), repression (revenge and trauma), and religion (radicalization). The first debate concentrates on the structural factors explaining mass mobilization in the North Caucasus following the end of the Soviet Union. The second debate underscores the role of religious radicalization in mobilization patterns in Chechnya and the North Caucasus, as well as its potential links with other conflicts (Afghanistan and Syria) and the importance of suicide bombings. Finally, the third debate focuses on the study of counter-insurgency and counterterrorism, the development of the Caucasus Emirate, and the diffusion of insurgent violence across the region. The article concludes by underlining the need to engage on a larger theorization of violent mobilization in the North Caucasus seeking to integrate structural, organizational and individual variables linking the global dynamics and local specificities of the region. © 2015 International Association for the Study of the Caucasus.

AB  - Purpose: Behavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders. Methods: Using a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences. Results: Findings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered – some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Botnets have become one of the most significant cyber threats over the last decade. The diffusion of the "Internet of Things" and its for-profit exploitation, contributed to botnets spread and sophistication, thus providing real, efficient and profitable criminal cyber-services. Recent research on botnet detection focuses on traffic pattern-based detection, and on analyzing the network traffic generated by the infected hosts, in order to find behavioral patterns independent from the specific payloads, architectures and protocols. In this paper we address the periodic behavioral patterns of infected hosts communicating with their Command-and-Control servers. The main novelty introduced is related to the traffic analysis in the frequency domain without using the well-known Fast Fourier Transform. Moreover, the mentioned analysis is performed through the exploitation of the proxy logs, easily deployable on almost every real-world scenario, from enterprise networks to mobile devices. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Comparative Case Analysis (CCA) is an important tool for criminal investigation and crime theory extraction. It analyzes the commonalities and differences between a collection of crime reports in order to understand crime patterns and identify abnormal cases. A big challenge of CCA is the data processing and exploration. Traditional manual approach can no longer cope with the increasing volume and complexity of the data. In this paper we introduce a novel visual analytics system, Spherical Similarity Explorer (SSE) that automates the data processing process and provides interactive visualizations to support the data exploration. We illustrate the use of the system with uses cases that involve real world application data and evaluate the system with criminal intelligence analysts. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

AB  - The field of environmental criminology is a staple theoretical framework in contemporary criminological theory. With this book, Martin Andresen presents the first comprehensive and sole-authored textbook on this influential and compelling school of criminological thought. He covers a wide range of topics, including: the origins of environmental criminology; the primary theoretical frameworks, such as routine activity theory, geometric theory of crime, rational choice theory, and the pattern theory of crime; the practical application of environmental criminology; an examination of how theories are operationalized and tested; policy implications for the practice of crime prevention. As well as these "popular topics", Andresen also discusses also a number of topics that are at the leading edge of research within environmental criminology. This text will be ideal for courses on crime prevention, where students are often encouraged to consider policy problems and apply theory to practice. This book offers up environmental criminology as a theoretical framework for making sense of complex neighbourhood problems, meaning that it will be perfect for modules on geography of crime, crime analysis and indeed, environmental criminology. It would also be a good supplement for courses on criminological theory. © 2014 Martin A. Andresen.

AB  - Taking an historical and descriptive approach, this paper explores migratory patterns of Senegalese, Ghanaians, and Nigerians crossing the Netherlands since the 1970s and Dutch reactions to these migratory patterns. This exploration is placed in the context of West African migration worldwide and based on census material, historical data and empirical data from others and examples from my fieldwork in Senegal and in the Netherlands. The study of West African migrants is specifically of interest in the Netherlands because West African immigration, especially from Ghana and Nigeria, formed an important element in the growth of the authorities' anxiety about illegality and criminality in Dutch society. Dutch antimigrant political climate and strict immigration measurements seem to have two, opposing effects: on the one hand, the period of illegality, and thus of restricted movement, for illegal migrants increases. On the other hand, the stimulus for those with a legal status to migrate out of the Netherlands, and thus their mobility, also increases.

AB  - Background: The Government of India declared TB as a notifiable disease in 2012. There is a paucity of information on the government's mandatory TB notification order from the perspective of private medical practitioners (PPs). Objective: To understand the awareness, perception and barriers on TB notification among PPs in Chennai, India. Methods: Total of 190 PPs were approached in their clinics by trained field staff who collected data using a semi-structured and pre-coded questionnaire after getting informed consent. The data collected included PPs' specialization, TB management practices, awareness about the TB notification order, barriers in its implementation and their suggestions to improve notification. Results: Of 190 PPs from varied specializations, 138 (73%) had diagnosed TB cases in the prior three months, of whom 78% referred these patients to government facilities. Of 138 PPs, 73% were aware of the order on mandatory TB notification, of whom 46 (33%) had ever notified a TB case. Of 120 PPs, 63% reported reasons for not notifying TB cases. The main reasons reported for not notifying were lack of time (50%), concerns regarding patients' confidentiality (24%) and fear of offending patients (11%). Of 145 PPs, 76% provided feedback about information they felt uncomfortable reporting during notification. PPs felt most uncomfortable reporting patient's government-issued Aadhar number (77%), followed by patient's phone number (37%) and residential address (26%). The preferred means of notification was through mobile phone communication (24%), SMS (18%) and e-mail (17%). Conclusion: This study highlights that one-fourth of PPs were not aware of the TB notification order and not all those who were aware were notifying. While it is important to sensitize PPs on the importance of TB notification it is also important to understand the barriers faced by PPs and to make the process user-friendly in order to increase TB notification. © 2016 Thomas et al.

AB  - Banks are faced with the challenge of adapting to the ever-changing risk and methods related to money laundering. Money laundering is a complex, dynamic and distributed process. Some Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Systems simply transforms vast quantities of data into vast numbers of reports that do not facilitate timely detection or effective interdiction. Transaction Flow Analysis (TFA) system is proposed to get over this issue. The main parts of this TFA system is, first, bank transaction importer, which is not bound to any file format. Second, application of frequent pattern mining and transaction mining algorithms to detect money laundering, which implements distributive box and collective box. Third, clustering the transaction and detecting suspicious clusters by recognizing laundering methods and roles of the offender. Finally obtained clusters and frequent patterns can be visualized in schema and timeline diagrams. It allows the bank or police analyst to find suspected money flows and suspicious transactions.

AB  - Searching for the group members that participate in a joint action based on collecting and analyzing the position information of moving objects could provide an important support for the decision makers in the fields such as the investigation of criminal cases, group emergency disposal, a large-scale military action etc. Following the pattern analysis of mobile objects based on their position information, this paper proposes a group member search method for mobile objects based on pattern similarity, which identifies group members by utilizing the correlation information of the mobility attributes such as trajectory, speed, direction and acceleration. Compared with group clustering or classification based on trajectory distance, the overlapping interference can be effectively avoided between members in different groups, and this method fits the objective law of group movement better. Combining with the application background, the experimental analysis confirms that the proposed method can quickly and accurately find the group members. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The vertebrate immune system exists in equilibrium with the microbial world. The innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns via a family ofToll-like receptors (TLR) that activate cells upon detection of potential pathogens. Because some microbes benefit their hosts, mobilizing the appropriate response, and then controlling that response is critical in the maintenance of health.TLR4 recognizes the various forms of lipid A produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Depending on the structural form of the eliciting lipid A molecule, TLR4 responses range from a highly inflammatory endotoxic response involving inflammasome and other pro-inflammatory mediators, to an inhibitory, protective response. Mounting the correct response against an offending microbe is key to maintain-ing health when exposed to various bacterial species. Further study of lipid A variants may pave the way to understanding how TLR4 responses are generally able to avoid chronic inflammatory damage. © 2012 Chilton, Embry and Mitchell.

AB  - Rationale: Stimulant use is a significant and prevalent problem, particularly in criminal populations. Previous studies found that cocaine and methamphetamine use is related to impairment in identifying emotions and empathy. Stimulant users also have abnormal neural structure and function of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and anterior (ACC) and posterior cingulate (PCC), regions implicated in moral decision-making. However, no research has studied the neural correlates of stimulant use and explicit moral processing in an incarcerated population. Objectives: Here, we examine how stimulant use affects sociomoral processing that might contribute to antisocial behavior. We predicted that vmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and ACC would show abnormal neural response during a moral processing task in incarcerated methamphetamine and cocaine users. Methods: Incarcerated adult males (N = 211) were scanned with a mobile MRI system while completing a moral decision-making task. Lifetime drug use was assessed. Neural responses during moral processing were compared between users and non-users. The relationship between duration of use and neural function was also examined. Results: Incarcerated stimulant users showed less amygdala engagement than non-users during moral processing. Duration of stimulant use was negatively associated with activity in ACC and positively associated with vmPFC response during moral processing. Conclusions: These results suggest a dynamic pattern of fronto-limbic moral processing related to stimulant use with deficits in both central motive and cognitive integration elements of biological moral processes theory. This increases our understanding of how drug use relates to moral processing in the brain in an ultra-high-risk population. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Since the Android operating system was released by Google in 2007, it has developed to the top smart phone sales around the world. Meanwhile, Android has also designed many measures of security protection for the users, and the pattern lock is one of the most popular ways on Android smart phones. However, this kind of function may be seen as a protection way to criminals. Therefore, there comes the need of physical acquisition and unlocking the pattern lock on Android devices for digital forensics. This research is based on the process of mobile forensics provided by National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is designed for physical acquisition, images making and pattern unlock when the Android smart phones are under the pattern lock. The evidence and images can be analyzed through computers and it can increase the capability of restoring the deleted data, and the unlocked mobile can be used to do logical acquisition. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This book offers a comprehensive introduction to juvenile delinquency by defining and describing juvenile delinquency, examining explanations for delinquent behavior, and considering contemporary efforts to control delinquency through prevention and juvenile justice. The text cultivates an understanding of juvenile delinquency by examining and linking key criminological theories and research. Coverage includes: • the historical origins and transformation of “juvenile delinquency” and juvenile justice; • the nature of delinquency, addressing the extent of delinquent offenses, the social correlates of offending and victimization (age, gender, race and ethnicity, and social class), and the developmental patterns of offending; • theoretical explanations of delinquency, with insights from biosocial criminology, routine activities, rational choice, social control, social learning, social structure, labeling, and critical criminologies; • evidence-based practice in delinquency prevention and contemporary juvenile justice. Fully revised and updated, the new edition incorporates the latest theory and research in the field of juvenile delinquency and provides expanded discussion of contemporary juvenile justice reform, evidence-based practice in delinquency prevention, and disproportionate minority contact throughout the juvenile justice process. This book is essential reading for courses on juvenile delinquency and juvenile justice. The book is supported by a range of compelling pedagogical features. Each chapter includes key terms, learning objectives, an opening case study, box inserts that provide practical application of theory and research, critical thinking questions, suggested reading, useful websites, and a glossary of key terms. A companion website offers an array of resources for students and instructors. For students, this website provides chapter overviews, flashcards of key terms, and useful websites. The instructor site is password protected and offers a complete set of PowerPoint slides and an extensive test bank for each chapter-all prepared by the authors. © 2016 James Burfeind and Dawn Jeglum Bartusch.

AB  - Since the Agent-based simulation tool was introduced into criminology research, most work concentrated on crime theory validation or hypothesis testing, little was contributed to crime spatial pattern replication. In this paper, using street network and subway network as the landscape and proposing a statistic-based instead of predefined human mobility pattern as the individual's routine activity, the spatial distribution of burglary in Beijing is simulated and valid by the actual pattern. The result indicates that the Agent-based modeling method partly detects the crime hotspots and the spatial pattern of crime, and specifically the crime level on the nodes with different accessibility is proved to be identical to the actual one. The study made in this work demonstrates that Agent-based modeling is a potential tool to predict or explain crime pattern in space, and also some further work which aims to improve its validation is discussed in the end of this paper. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - As a consequence of the growing popularity of smart mobile devices, mobile malware is clearly on the rise, with attackers targeting valuable user information and exploiting vulnerabilities of the mobile ecosystems. With the emergence of large-scale mobile botnets, smartphones can also be used to launch attacks on mobile networks. The NEMESYS project will develop novel security technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem, and improve mobile network security through better understanding of the threat landscape. NEMESYS will gather and analyze information about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting mobile users and the mobile network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We will develop a data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots and a honeyclient, to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile attacks and better understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile devices. By correlating the extracted information with the known patterns of attacks from wireline networks, we will reveal and identify trends in the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against mobile devices. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - The social, economic, and cultural impacts of sex offender legislation are topics of considerable interest in recent years. Despite the number of studies evaluating the collateral consequences of these laws, the implications of spatial restrictions on housing availability and residential mobility for convicted sex offenders remain an empirical question. Because of the social implications, but also risks associated with recidivism, a better understanding of the spatio-temporal movements of sex offenders is critical for developing effective management policies and strategies aimed at promoting public safety. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze sex offender residential movement patterns over a 2.5 year period in Hamilton County, Ohio. Using geographic information systems and a developed exploratory system, SOSTAT, this study uncovers significant trends and behavioral patterns that shed light on offender reintegration, their residential mobility and the implications of residency restrictions on both offenders and community. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Purpose Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example. Methods Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour - central place foraging, Brownian walks and Lévy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Lévy walks, respectively. Results Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Lévy walks. Conclusions The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Lévy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Recording videos on smartphones and other mobile devices, given their enormous popularity, is currently very common. The portability of these devices facilitates their use for recording videos in a wide variety of situations, including while witnessing criminal activities. These videos can be later used as evidence in legal proceedings. Therefore, the forensic analysis of videos taken with mobile device videos is important, and could serve for legal and also investigative purposes. It is necessary, however, to use techniques that are quite specific to this type of devices, given some peculiar features of their cameras. In this paper, we will address the issue of video source acquisition identification by presenting a technique based on sensor noise and wavelet transform extraction from video key frames. These frames are extracted using an efficient algorithm that takes their content into account, improving the selection of frames to be analyzed over past proposals. The scheme presented consists of four stages: (1) Key frames extraction, (2) sensor pattern noise extraction, (3) feature extraction, and (4) classifier training and prediction. We also present experimental results that support the validity of the techniques used and show promising results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of the epistemological and methodological debates about rational choice (RC) sparked by Green and Shapiro and the subsequent rejoinders, Hindmoor made the theoretical claim that there is now an opportunity for RC to be enhanced and for past debates to be set aside by incorporating different theoretical perspectives into RC. This article presents an example of one context in which this can be done: the study of illegal private protection (IPP) produced by organised criminals and corrupt officials. It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC). Both positive and negative forms and effects of SC are considered. This approach highlights a middle ground between advocates and critics of RC, demonstrating a capacity to explain patterns in the production of IPP between organisations and across countries. © 2014 Australian Political Studies Association.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders’ awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders’ family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members’ residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders’ children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally. © 2016 American Society of Criminology

AB  - We consider in this paper the analysis of a large set of malware and benign applications from the Android ecosystem. Although a large body of research work has dealt with Android malware over the last years, none has addressed it from a forensic point of view. After collecting over 500,000 applications from user markets and research repositories, we perform an analysis that yields precious insights on the writing process of Android malware. This study also explores some strange artifacts in the datasets, and the divergent capabilities of state-of-the-art antivirus to recognize/define malware. We further highlight some major weak usage and misunderstanding of Android security by the criminal community and show some patterns in their operational flow. Finally, using insights from this analysis, we build a naive malware detection scheme that could complement existing anti virus software. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - As tablet computers and smartphones have become widespread, organizations are increasingly using mobile applications for supporting routines, i. e., repetitive patterns of activity that occur throughout an organization. However, prior studies see user interactions mostly as a silo–able to help individual users perform better–but not embedded in an organizational context of a user group or company. In order to address this gap, the paper at hand looks into the roles of mobile applications in supporting routines, and the related principles for mobile application design. We present two mobile applications that support domain experts in two diverse contexts, automotive car dealerships and hospitals. Based on their analysis, we were able to identify patterns as well as a number of design principles for mobile applications supporting organizational routines. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Activity spaces describe the physical area typically encountered by an individual person during his or her routine daily activities. Activity spaces encompass a person’s anchor points – locations that are frequented regularly, such as home, work, school, and recreational areas – and the travel paths that connect them. Activity spaces of criminals are routinely mapped in order to better understand the spatial patterns and processes of crime at the individual level. Although many geographic information system-based methods have been used to map activity spaces over the years, potential path areas are becoming a preferred method since they incorporate both spatial and temporal data, as well as time budget and mobility constraints. This paper extends potential path areas for mapping activity spaces of criminals in two ways. First, time-geographic density estimation (TGDE) is used to estimate individual activity spaces using potential path areas that have associated probability densities. Second, activity spaces of numerous individuals are combined into a single intensity surface that maps areas of a city that are more frequented by offenders and, accordingly, expected to support higher crime rates. The approach is demonstrated using a dataset of home and work addresses of registered sex offenders in the city of St. Louis. The final density surface of their combined activity spaces is related to the locations of reported sex crimes. The results highlight how sex crimes are concentrated in offender activity spaces and suggest the approach might be useful for predictive policing. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the pervasiveness of computers and mobile devices, digital forensics becomes more important in law enforcement. Detectives increasingly depend on the scarce support of digital specialists which impedes efficiency of criminal investigations. This paper proposes and algorithm to extract, merge and rank identities that are encountered in the electronic evidence during processing. Two experiments are described demonstrating that our approach can assist with the identification of frequently occurring identities so that investigators can prioritize the investigation of evidence units accordingly. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The mass demonstrations that took place in 2011 in major cities worldwide, dubbed here Contemporary Metropolitan Protest (CMP), varied in terms of the issues tackled and the political efficacy attained, but featured similarities in style, mobilization patterns and the use of traditional and social media. The similarities explain the tendency among commentators and researchers to treat CMP as a coherent category. The variation, on the other hand, raises questions about conceptual and theoretical idioms used so far in the analysis of CMP. The article begins by scrutinizing "resistance"-an idiom introduced to anthropology in the 1980s to theorize peasant response to metropolitan policies-and its recent emergence in the depiction and analysis of CMP. Highlighting the strengths and limitations of the term, I use the rise and fall of CMP in Tel Aviv in 2011 and 2012 as an example of how the implicit logic of aggression and response, so central to earlier employment of the notion of resistance, can be hijacked by defensive regimes that seek to delegitimize and criminalize critique, thus forcing CMP to decline and implode. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - This chapter considers how organised crime has been affected by changing patterns of geographical mobility. It reflects on the difficulty this brings for conventional law enforcement activity and illustrates the opportunities provided for situational crime prevention techniques. Conceptually, the chapter draws on the ‘new mobilities paradigm’ (Sheller and Urry 2006) to consider how social changes documented in this emergent social science field intersect with changes in the organisation of criminality – particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality – which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational crime. We examined this phenomenon through a small empirical study conducted in three English police forces between 2007–8. This study comprised an analysis of the organised crime investigations of a medium-sized force, supplemented by 11 interviews conducted with senior investigators in three police forces, attendance at seminars, and informal conversations with practitioners at different organisational levels and locations.; We propose that increased levels of mobile criminality are impacting significantly on the scope and variety of organised crime in England. In particular it is evident that, despite the attention paid to transnational policing in the organised crime literature, the burden of policing organised crime continues to fall upon local police forces where demand outstrips supply. In consequence, the necessity of a new paradigm for dealing with organised crime is critical. We argue here that a situational crime prevention approach, coupled with a further modification of that concept (which we refer to as situational crime disruption), is more effective, in terms of impact and cost. © The editors and contributors 2010.

AB  - This article demonstrates the reconceptualisation of female criminality in interwar British popular culture. It argues that in fiction and the popular press, the period signalled the rise of the strategic female career criminal who challenged traditional gendered patterns of law-breaking, appropriated wider notions of fashionable modernity and transgressed social and geographic boundaries as poorer women embraced new opportunities for masquerade and used crime for upward social mobility. The article shows that the modern female criminal reflected broader shifts and changes in opportunities and roles for women, suggesting that she functions as a prism through which to explore wider debates and anxieties around femininity, 1918–1939. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The majority of sexual assault disclosures are by females although most sexual abuse remains undisclosed. There are many factors feeding into this reluctance. Sensitive and appropriate management of disclosures is essential to re-empower victims in making choices on the course of events following disclosure. Not all victims opt to engage with the criminal justice system. However, the option of police engagement to some degree may be supported by the offering of third-party reporting, providing police with intelligence that would otherwise be inaccessible. The presence of genital injuries is more likely with non-consensual than consensual sexual activity, but genital injuries are still more likely to be absent following sexual assault. Physical examination following sexual assault seeks to identify any peripheral injuries associated with restraint or non-compliance. Screening to exclude the possibility of sexually transmitted infections should be informed by the incubation periods of common pathogens, and prophylactic treatment guided by local resistance patterns. Emergency contraception, ongoing contraception and safer sex advice should form part of the consultation. In addition, self-harm and suicide risk assessments should be undertaken to ensure onward safety. Finally, the potential impact of disclosures on clinicians should be acknowledged. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on analyzing time-varying position information of moving objects, searching the group members which participate in a joint action could provide an important support for the decision makers in the field such as the investigation of criminal cases, group emergency disposal, large-scale military action etc. As the expansion of mobility properties correlation analysis, this paper proposed a novel group member search method based on dispersion analysis, which focused on analyzing the dispersion variation before and after the introduction of a moving object into a group. Comparing the method judging only by mobility properties correlation, the proposed method can effectively reduce the occurrence probability of misclassification in some case, and search the group members more accurately. Combined with application background, the experiment analysis confirmed the validity and practicability of this method. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter addresses policy and practice considerations with a view to reducing cyberbullying and enhancing digital citizenship. I highlight the policy vacuum and challenges of balancing free expression, safety, privacy, supervision and regulation within the school context. I explain the emerging pattern in my research, that suggests digital natives (youth growing up immersed in digital media) often fail to distinguish the lines between harmless joking or teasing, and harmful cyberbullying that negatively impacts those targeted and fail to realize potential legal risks. Legal liability for cyberbullying can include lawsuits for defamation through online postings that spread rumours, gossip and demeaning comments. Young people risk criminal liability for online threats made in jest that might be perceived as "actual" threats that will be carried out in physical contexts. Potential charges of possession and distribution of child pornography can be laid for "sexting," a form of intimate photographs or videotapes distributed online to embarrass others. My chapter calls for legal literacy among educators, and the need to sensitize the legal community to shifting norms of social communication among digital youth. I argue that new laws specifically aimed at controlling cyberbullying show less promise than legal frameworks in North America, Europe and Australia that already exist. These frameworks include constitutional and human rights considerations, tort law (civil liability - defamation, libel, slander, privacy); and criminal law. I argue for preventative policy and practice responses that are congruent with the obligations of countries that are parties to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). These approaches will go further towards mobilizing socially responsible digital citizenship among youth than reactive approaches that continue to be adopted by schools and some governments that are introducing harsher legislation. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - In this article we present the results of a study to explore if cross-border DNA matches between the Netherlands and Belgium are relatively more likely to occur in areas near the Dutch-Belgian border than in areas at some distance from this border. For this study we used the results of the transnational DNA profile exchange and comparison between the Belgian and Dutch DNA databases, which first took place in 2014. It appears that the Dutch regions adjacent to Belgium, i.e., Zeeland-West-Brabant, Oost-Brabant and Limburg, have relatively more DNA matches with Belgium than the other Dutch regions. In other words, a DNA profile obtained from a crime scene close to the Dutch border with Belgium is more likely to match with the profile of a person whose DNA profile is stored in the Belgian database than a DNA profile that originates from a crime scene further afield. Our data suggest that crimes committed by repeat offenders show a spatial pattern despite the presence of a national border, with crime scenes clustering in relatively close proximity to each other. The results of this study provide a better understanding of geographical patterns of cross-border criminal mobility. © 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences

AB  - Objectives: To test whether there is a relationship between characteristics of the journey to an outdoor cannabis cultivation site and the total number of plants grown. Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: prime, rugged, dry, and remote. Prime sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying "prime" locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail-crime pattern and social disorganization theory-and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder. © 2013 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that perceptions of social class rank influence a variety of social cognitive tendencies, from patterns of causal attribution to moral judgment. In the present studies we tested the hypotheses that upper-class rank individuals would be more likely to endorse essentialist lay theories of social class categories (i.e., that social class is founded in genetically based, biological differences) than would lower-class rank individuals and that these beliefs would decrease support for restorative justice-which seeks to rehabilitate offenders, rather than punish unlawful action. Across studies, higher social class rank was associated with increased essentialism of social class categories (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and decreased support for restorative justice (Study 4). Moreover, manipulated essentialist beliefs decreased preferences for restorative justice (Study 3), and the association between social class rank and class-based essentialist theories was explained by the tendency to endorse beliefs in a just world (Study 2). Implications for how class-based essentialist beliefs potentially constrain social opportunity and mobility are discussed. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

AB  - West Africa is the most mobile part of Africa;1 it has historically been a region of continuous population movements and it continues to attract migrants from across the region. The people of West Africa share a socio-cultural and economic link, which contributes to these movements across national borders. The socio-cultural link is evident through the agglomerations of people by arbitrarily drawing the colonial map. The economic link is facilitated by trading across borders, due to close proximity, and also by socio-cultural and language commonalities. All these factors along, with a shared colonial legacy, influence movement options, whether country of transit or of destination. Human trafficking remains an intractable global problem, 2 which has re-emerged in recent times as a modernized form of slavery. Trafficking involves the movement of people from their country of origin to other destinations by any means of forced labor or services. This illicit business in persons, mostly children and women, affects almost all countries and reaps enormous profits for traffickers and their criminal intermediaries. Human trafficking is considered one of the largest sources of profits for organized crime, generating an estimated seven to ten billion dollars annually, according to the United Nations estimate.3 The globalization of the world economy has increased the movement of people across borders, legally and illegally; especially from the poorer to the wealthier countries. The international organized trafficking network has taken advantage of the free flow of people to extend its own global reach. The trafficking process involves source, transit and destination countries, with some countries combining all these characteristics simultaneously. Since trafficking is an underground criminal enterprise, there are no precise statistics on the extent of the problem. Nevertheless, the estimates of the US Department of State’s 2007 Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP Report) vary from 4 to 27 million. The United Nations estimates that about two million women are trapped each year in the worldwide sex industry, while countless children and other women are forced into low-waged jobs. Below, we focus on labor migration, human trafficking and multinational corporations within the ECOWAS region. This paper examines the patterns and challenges of labor migration in West Africa. To understand the dynamic of labor migration, under the heading of patterns we focus on the causes of labor migration. The challenges to labor migration that are discussed are incoherent policies on migration management. Furthermore, we examine the trafficking of women, girls and children, the root causes of trafficking, ECOWAS involvement in signing and ratifying the ‘human trafficking protocol’ and recommendations to the ECOWAS states for better response to victims of human trafficking. We conclude with recommendations for ECOWAS to formulate and adopt effective policies for migration management in the region. © 2012 Ato Quayson and Antonela Arhin for selection and editorial material.

AB  - Residential population data are frequently employed to link the crime incidence of an area with the number of residents to estimate the underlying risk. Human mobility patterns cause shifts in the baseline population, however, that can potentially influence the crime statistics. This study therefore employed an ambient population that combined residential population data with data depicting the commuting activity in small administrative areas. The effects of the commuter-harmonized ambient population on crime were then evaluated in a series of negative binomial regression models. The models also controlled for criminogenic factors and incorporated eigenvector spatial filtering to adjust for spatial effects. The results show significant effects of commuting patterns on crime outcomes. For certain crimes, such as violence, theft, and disorder, the inbound commuters are significantly associated with high risk. It was further discovered that an offset variable comprising the commuter-harmonized ambient population data models the crime outcomes more reliably than when residential population data are used. Spatial filtering was found to effectively eradicate residual spatial autocorrelation after accounting for effects of the predictor variables. We conclude that calculating crime rates using the residential population does not constitute an accurate risk measure and that the ambient population has crucial implications for realistic and reliable target representation and crime modeling. © 2016 by American Association of Geographers.

AB  - Identification plays a major role in any crime investigation. The pattern of wrinkles on the lips has individual characteristics like fingerprints. Cheiloscopy is a forensic investigation technique that deals with identification of humans based on lips traces. In the past decades, lip-print studies attracted the attention of many scientists as a new tool for human identification in both civil and criminal issues. The lip crease pattern is on the vermilion border of the lip, which is quite mobile and lip prints may vary in appearance according to the pressure, direction and method used in making the print. It concludes by enlightening the readers with the fact that the possibilities to use the red part of lips to identify a human being are wider than it is commonly thought.

AB  - Policing is back on the political agenda in most of the 15 Member States of the European Union (EU). The internationalization of internal security seems to have sent a new wave through the management and organization oflaw enforcement. First, there is crime itself. European states have come to recognize common patterns in their crime statistics, such as its growth, its scale, and its consequences for society as a whole (Hom & Cozijnsen 1995: 1). Second, the explanation of crime is now more than ever related to supra-nation al causes, such as the relaxation of internal border controls, the cross-frontier mobility of criminals and the global character of crime-enterprises. Law enforcement organizations, mostly the producers of these analyses, react tointernational ization of internal security in different ways. They tend to adapt the scale of their organization to the seriousness of the crime, and they seek to improve their efficiency by adopting innovative managerial strategies. In this process, police organizations monitor the latest developments in befriended and neighbouring countries and 'borrow' features which they consider to be resourceful in their fight against crime problems. This demonstrates how internationalization of criminality influences the development of national law enforcement, but it also demonstrates that, conversely, cross-border law enforcement shopping encourages the internationalization of policing. It goes without doubt that processes of internationalization and cross-fertilization tend to iron out some of the remaining differences between the Anglo-Saxon and continental policing systems. © Rob Mawby 1999.

AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-tocrime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime. © 2015 by the American Society of Criminology.

AB  - The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The number of older prisoners is rising rapidly throughout the world and this trend is expected to continue. In this chapter, the characteristics and needs of older adults in prison will be discussed, including their differences in comparison to younger prisoners. I will present the main challenges that elderly prisoners are raising, and my personal experience of conducting research among elderly detainees. Currently there is little in the way of age-specific service provision for elderly offenders despite their high degree of chronic physical and mental health need. In contrast to other offenders, this group is more likely to have mobility needs as well as a different pattern of social and custodial problems. Research into this area is limited, though growing, particularly in the US and UK, with some interesting developments being made. A strong evidence-base is needed to inform national and international policy about how best to care for and manage older offenders. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test whether there is a relationship between situational and modus operandi characteristics and criminal mobility during the sexual assault event. Data collected from both police files and semistructured interviews with 72 serial sex offenders who have committed 361 sexual assaults have been used. Negative binomial regression was used to identify the relationships between the situational and modus operandi characteristics and the criminal mobility exhibited during the sexual assault. Events that involved child or adolescent victims, those where the offender did not use pornography prior to crime, and those where victim resistance was observed exhibited more criminal mobility. Moreover, crimes in which the victim was selected, the victim was alone when approached by the offender, and the assault was characterized by sexual penetration and a lack of premeditation exhibited more criminal mobility. Results seem to suggest that criminal mobility is a goal-oriented action taken by serial sex offenders to successfully complete their crime and to avoid detection and apprehension. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Purpose: Crime analysts need accurate population-at-risk measures to quantify crime rates. This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for 'theft from the person' crimes. Method: 1.Collect 'ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media.2.Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor.3.Use the Gi* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators.4.Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates. Results and Discussion: The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors - i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted. Using data in 3337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before. This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent. Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Psychopathy is a disorder characterized by severe and frequent moral violations in multiple domains of life. Numerous studies have shown psychopathy-related limbic brain abnormalities during moral processing; however, these studies only examined negatively valenced moral stimuli. Here, we aimed to replicate prior psychopathy research on negative moral judgments and to extend this work by examining psychopathy-related abnormalities in the processing of controversial moral stimuli and positive moral processing. Incarcerated adult males (N = 245) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol on a mobile imaging system stationed at the prison. Psychopathy was assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R). Participants were then shown words describing three types of moral stimuli: wrong (e.g., stealing), not wrong (e.g., charity), and controversial (e.g., euthanasia). Participants rated each stimulus as either wrong or not wrong. PCL-R total scores were correlated with not wrong behavioral responses to wrong moral stimuli, and were inversely related to hemodynamic activity in the anterior cingulate cortex in the contrast of wrong > not wrong. In the controversial > noncontroversial comparison, psychopathy was inversely associated with activity in the temporal parietal junction and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that psychopathy-related abnormalities are observed during the processing of complex, negative, and positive moral stimuli. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Motivated by rising levels of crime against property and findings in criminology research, we are developing CityWatch - the first mobile application that supports crime prevention behavior at community level. CityWatch leverages data on past crime incidents, which are sourced both from trustworthy sources, like the national census and the insurance industry, and from its users through crowd-sourcing. It applies machine learning algorithms to analyze the past incidents together with further data characterizing the living areas and learns common patterns of crime. These patterns are then leveraged in a general forecasting component, as well as in generating personalized risk profiles and crime prevention tips for registered users based on their account information. The results are visualized in an interactive map, where users can analyze past crime in their neighborhood and view predictions of future crime. Users can report a new crime and opt to receive notifications about new incidents in their proximity or area of residence. Copyright © 2014 ACM 978-1-4503-3304-7/14/11 ⋯$15.00.

AB  - Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Environmental criminology is a term that encompasses a range of overlapping perspectives. At its core, the many strands of environmental criminology are bound by a common focus on the role that the immediate environment plays in the performance of crime, and a conviction that careful analyses of these environmental influences are the key to the effective investigation, control, and prevention of crime. This new edition brings together leading theorists and practitioners in the field to provide a comprehensive, integrative coverage of the field of environmental criminology and crime analysis. This book is divided into three sequential parts: • Understanding the crime event explores routine activity approach, crime pattern theory, the rational choice perspective, and situational precipitators of crime. • Analysing crime patterns discusses crime mapping, offender mobility, repeat victimisation, geographic profiling, and crime scripts. • Preventing and controlling crime covers topics including problem oriented policing, situational crime prevention, and environmental design. Fully updated and including new chapters on crime scripts and offender mobility, a scene-setting introductory overview, and critical thinking questions at the end of each chapter, this text is an essential and comprehensive resource for practitioners and students taking courses on environmental criminology, crime analysis, and crime prevention. © 2017 Richard Wortley and Michael Townsley.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives—crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014

AB  - Criminal deportation policy in Canada follows a cyclical rather than a linear or partisan pattern. Based on a case study of Haitian residents deported between 1989 and 2009, I argue that criminal deportation cannot be explained as a stable proportion of the pool of permanent residents, but rather in terms of the political attention it generates. A change-point analysis identified two separate political mobilization phases. During the first phase (1994-1998), the integration of long-term residents is defined as a political issue and is translated into legislation (Bill C-44). The second phase (2003-2005) is a new episode of expansion that reformulated the issue around the concepts of risk and efficiency (Bill C-11). Despite recent legal reforms designed to accelerate removals of foreign criminals (Bills C-43 and C-60), the arrival of the Conservative Party (2006-2009) coincided with a decrease in criminal deportations during the period under review. © 2016 Canadian Political Science Association (l'Association canadienne de science politique).

AB  - Based on a rational choice approach, this study compares the decision making involved in the crime commission process of rapists (n = 30), child molesters (n = 17), and victim-crossover sex offenders (n = 22). Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders. © 2012 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology.

AB  - This paper explores the dynamics and underlying conditions of the first few months of the uprising in Syria, from mid-March 2011 until the summer of that year. Together with the contributions from Dalmasso and Kandil, it exploits the opportunity created by the Arab uprisings to shed new light on patterns of social mobilization and collective action that research programmes focusing on authoritarian resilience had tended to overlook. Specifically, it presents an analysis that critically and loosely borrows from, communicates with and hopes to make a modest contribution to social movement theory (SMT). While threat and opportunity are necessary elements for popular mobilization, they are not sufficient. Both 'threat' and 'opportunity' therefore need to be contextualized within the specific social and political environment, real or perceived, of the 'early risers' in Syria, in order to appreciate their local significance. The article further argues that protestors, when under threat and faced with the opportunity, collectively rose up by capitalizing on their dense social networks. Strong clan-based or tribal social structures, circular labour migration, cross-border linkages and proliferating practices denoted as 'criminal' variably played a key role in cementing these social networks. It is also contended that these networks' ability easily to dissolve into one another due to their high degree of interconnectedness was instrumental in collective mobilization and their ability to pose a strong and enduring challenge to the regime. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We live in a world in which we watch our words, spoken or written. We do not wish to offend anyone by what we say. But consideration of our speech is not something new. As Gabriella Baika stakes out in this thought-provoking manuscript, worries about transgressive speech began in the High Middle Ages. This broad-ranging book, which explores the notion of peccata linguae "sins of the tongue," mobilized the work efforts of an impressive number of theologians. Moral errors committed with the aid of the tongue, the organ responsible for speech, came to be viewed as crimes comparable to theft, adultery, or murder. The Rose and Geryon examines patterns of verbal behavior in works by Jean de Meun and Dante (with a focus on the Romance of the Rose and the Divine Comedy) in relationship with the most influential systems of verbal sins in the Middle Ages, systems elaborated by William Peraldus, Thomas Aquinas, Domenico Cavalca, and Laurent of Orléans. The book begins with a presentation of these four systems, and from there proceeds to analyze Jean de Meun's Testament as a possible source of influence for the Divine Comedy and take a closer look at Dante's prose works in search for a comprehensive theory of sinful speech. Furthermore Baika discusses verbal transgressions such as flattery, evil counsel, double talk, sowing of discord, and falsifying of words, under the heading Lingua dolosa "The Guileful Tongue," and the relationship between violence and the poetic discourse. The myriad ways in which the two iconic poets of medieval France and Italy absorb the tradition of peccata linguae in their works prove that abusive speech was not the exclusive sphere of interest of the ecclesiastical writers; secular poetry in the vernacular enriched in original ways the medieval debate on verbal vices. The Rose and Geryon addresses scholars and students of French and Italian literatures, as well as readers interested in ethics and women's studies. © 2014 The Catholic University of America Press.

AB  - Objectives: This article deals about an aspect not taken into consideration often when considering violent sexual offenses. The term "crime scene", which got widespread into common language, depicts all the elements collected at the place where a crime occurred and which could later become pieces of evidence. However, the place by itself, the link between the offender and the place, the influence of the urban environment and the cultural aspect of it do not receive that much attention in the literature. This paper originates from a comparison of the work of two psychologists specialized within the field of geoprofiling, D. Canter and K. Rossmo, the latter being a Canadian citizen and the former an Englishman. If their postulates were similar, their findings however diverged. If primary caretakers and early interactions are not to be underestimated regarding their roles into the personality development, we will in these pages consider the urban environment by itself in serial sexual offenses. Methods: Due to a restricted access to this type of patients, we mainly focused our hypothesis on a literature review and a few patients of ours, met during previous research works. Concepts used in this paper overlap various fields such as psychodynamic, criminology, criminalistics, psycho-sociology and even urbanism. We focused in this paper onto the importance of the culture and the urban concrete environment as probable variables explaining these discrepancies observed into the behavioral patterns and distances covered by Serial Sex Offenders between the two shores of the Atlantic. The underlying question being how their space conception, their "mental maps", depends of the culture they were bred in and how it could have an incident onto their offense zones? Results: The findings highlight an inherently cultural variation of the spatial conception, but also how the space is built up and integrated between the USA (and all the large and historically "recents" territories) and Europe. American sexual serial offenders are more likely to cover larger distances, almost twice as much than their European counterparts. It seems that our hypothesis is relevant; a cultural distinction may exist on the way spatial environment is perceived and could thus have incidences into the offense patterns. Conclusions: With the development of the E.U., our spatial conceptions as European citizens evolve. Thanks to mass transportation, and the Erasmus programs, it is not uncommon for an Italian individual to study in Scotland or Finland for instance. This is of some importance into how the spatial mobility is becoming more thinkable, and somehow how it induces a shrinkage of the distance into the mental mapping process. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Crime rate is a statistic used to summarize the risk of criminal events. However, research has shown that choosing the appropriate denominator is non-trivial. Different crime types exhibit different spatial opportunities and so does the population at risk. The residential population is the most commonly used population at risk, but is unlikely to be suitable for crimes that involve mobile populations. In this article, we use "crowd-sourced" data in Leeds, England, to measure the population at risk, considering violent crime. These new data sources have the potential to represent mobile populations at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than other available data. Through the use of two local spatial statistics (Getis-Ord GI∗ and the Geographical Analysis Machine) and visualization, we show that when the volume of social media messages, as opposed to the residential population, is used as a proxy for the population at risk, criminal event hot spots shift spatially. Specifically, the results indicate a significant shift in the city center, eliminating its hot spot. Consequently, if crime reduction/prevention efforts are based on resident population based crime rates, such efforts may not only be ineffective in reducing criminal event risk, but be a waste of public resources. © 2014 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.

AB  - The growing popularity of smart mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has made them an attractive target for cyber-criminals, resulting in a rapidly growing and evolving mobile threat as attackers experiment with new business models by targeting mobile users. With the emergence of the first large-scale mobile botnets, the core network has also become vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service attacks such as the signaling attack. Furthermore, complementary access methods such as Wi-Fi and femtocells introduce additional vulnerabilities for the mobile users as well as the core network. In this paper, we present the NEMESYS approach to smart mobile network security. The goal of the NEMESYS project is to develop novel security technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem, and to improve mobile network security through a better understanding of the threat landscape. To this purpose, NEMESYS will collect and analyze information about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting smart mobile devices and the core network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We are developing a data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots and honeyclients in order to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile attacks and understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile devices. By correlating the extracted information with known attack patterns from wireline networks, we plan to reveal and identify the possible shift in the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against smart mobile devices. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The article examines space-time patterns of maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa. Using rational choice theory and optimal foraging theory as the theoretic frame, 6 years of recorded pirate attack data were used to test whether spatial and temporal attack patterns were independent. The results indicate evidence for a communicability of risk; that is, pirate activity clusters in space and time. Incorporating this finding means that forecasting of high-risk areas could be made more effective. The theoretical implication is that pirates' target selection appears to be consistent with other crime types, such as burglary, car crime and shootings. The results have implications for informing maritime piracy prevention and suppression efforts. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Pre-Columbian populations that inhabited the Tarapacá mid river valley in the Atacama Desert in Chile during the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate Period (AD 500-1450) show patterns of chronic poisoning due to exposure to geogenic arsenic. Exposure of these people to arsenic was assessed using synchrotron-based elemental X-ray fluorescence mapping, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectromicroscopy measurements on ancient human hair. These combined techniques of high sensitivity and specificity enabled the discrimination between endogenous and exogenous processes that has been an analytical challenge for archeological studies and criminal investigations in which hair is used as a proxy of premortem metabolism. The high concentration of arsenic mainly in the form of inorganic As(III) and As(V) detected in the hair suggests chronic arsenicism through ingestion of As-polluted water rather than external contamination by the deposition of heavy metals due to metallophilic soil microbes or diffusion of arsenic from the soil. A decrease in arsenic concentration from the proximal to the distal end of the hair shaft analyzed may indicate a change in the diet due to mobility, though chemical or microbiologically induced processes during burial cannot be entirely ruled out. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this paper, we are examining and analyzing human behavior model throughout reality data sources to extract patterns and clues of criminal and suspicious acts. Reality data composed of the digital traces people leave while interacting with computing devices. In this paper, we are focusing on data from people's interaction with social networks and mobile usage such as location markers and call logs. This work also introduces a model for detecting suspicious behavior based on social network feeds. It is based on classification model that can categorize a set of input actions and movements into three types of behavior, criminal, suspicious, or normal. The proposed system is expected to help crime analysts create faster and precise decisions.The model is expected to provide a behavior profile to help crime analysts in the process of crime prevention, understanding crime motivations, and proactive policing. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter considers how organised crime has been affected by changing patterns of geographical mobility. It reflects on the difficulty this brings for conventional law enforcement activity and illustrates the opportunities provided for situational crime prevention techniques. Conceptually, the chapter draws on the ŉew mobilities paradigm’ (Sheller and Urry 2006) to consider how social changes documented in this emergent social science field intersect with changes in the organisation of criminality - particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality - which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational crime. We examined this phenomenon through a small empirical study conducted in three English police forces between 2007-8. This study comprised an analysis of the organised crime investigations of a medium-sized force, supplemented by 11 interviews conducted with senior investigators in three police forces, attendance at seminars, and informal conversations with practitioners at different organisational levels and locations. © The editors and contributors 2010.

AB  - According to the organized–disorganized model, organized sexual murderers adopt specific behaviors during the commission of their crimes that contribute to avoiding police detection. The current study examines the effect of sexual murderers’ organized behaviors on their ability to both delay and/or avoid police detection. Using a combination of negative binomial and logistic regression analyses on a sample of 350 sexual murder cases, findings showed that although both measures of delaying and avoiding detection are positively correlated, different behavioral patterns were observed. For instance, offenders who moved the victim’s body were more likely to avoid detection but the victim’s body was likely to be recovered faster. Moreover, victim characteristics have an impact on both measures; however, this effect disappears for the measure of delaying detection once the organized behaviors are introduced. Implications of the findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Objectives: This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions. Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - The advent of modern smart phones and handheld devices has given analysts, decision-makers, and even the general public the ability to rapidly ingest data and translate it into actionable information on-The-go. In this paper, we explore the design and use of a mobile visual analytics toolkit for public safety data that equips law enforcement agencies with effective situation awareness and risk assessment tools. Our system provides users with a suite of interactive tools that allow them to perform analysis and detect trends, patterns and anomalies among criminal, traffic and civil (CTC) incidents. The system also provides interactive risk assessment tools that allow users to identify regions of potential high risk and determine the risk at any user-specified location and time. Our system has been designed for the iPhone/iPad environment and is currently being used and evaluated by a consortium of law enforcement agencies. We report their use of the system and some initial feedback. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - São Paulo is the largest city in South America, with crime rates that reflect its size. The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion, Revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data. The experiments show the capability of CrimAnalyzer in identifying crime-related phenomena. © 2015 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mass storage media are becoming increasingly common due to the spread of smartphones to which new technologies are applied. Correspondingly, the amount of data collected from digital crime has considerably increased. Previously, if an investigator did not properly conduct the initial response, valuable evidence would be lost. Thus, collection of digital evidence within a short time frame is required. Further, in searches using data from the smartphones to gather evidence, evidence must be collected and analyzed quickly. Therefore, in this paper, a method is proposed for rapidly collecting data at a crime scene based on the type of criminal charge. Once implemented, our method can collect data by accounting for each feature of the software, providing rapid results through a pattern search. There is also a range of options available with parallel routines. Single or multiple options can be utilized depending on the investigator’s requirements. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The flexible use of credit and debit card transactions has become increasingly ubiquitous and so have the associated vulnerabilities that make them a common target for cyber criminals. Furthermore, a prevalent complication associated with blocking of ATM cards involves tedious interactive processes and even possibly long waiting times during interaction with customer care services. Using a three factor authentication scheme employing NFC (Near Field Communication: an emerging technology evolved from a combination of contact-less identification and interconnection providing data exchange), Dash Matrix Algorithm and One-time password, we describe and quantify the potential to overcome common transaction liabilities (brute force attack, shoulder surfing, skimming of ATM cards, etc.). The auxiliary feature of blocking ATM cards is implemented using a QR code authentication scheme and NFC technology, implemented both in NFC enabled phones and non-NFC phones (with the help of an NFC transmitter, receiver and Bluetooth). The proposed system, therefore, ensures both secure usage of ATM cards and cost effectiveness by utility of novel and increasingly common technology, when also simultaneously proving to be user friendly. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The current study employed the International Crime Victimization Survey for 142,665 subjects in 35 countries to compare residential burglary patterns across countries by their developmental levels. The mixed-level modeling shows that households in less developed countries were more likely to experience residential burglary than those in highly developed countries. In addition, married status and low income levels were positively, while living in a detached house was negatively, related to burglary victimization. These findings are consistent with routine activity theory. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Forensic chemical/biochemical analysis is an essential tool in the criminal justice system, particularly when examining physical evidence to support criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions. A biochemistry/molecular biology-based subarea of forensic analysis, forensic serology, deals with the complex task of gathering information on the type of sample, age, origin, or sex from biological fluids found at a crime scene. Forensic serology relies on two methods: immunoassays and DNA/RNA analysis. This chapter reviews biochemical analysis of biomarkers and these methods are exemplified with the analysis of the ethnicity and sex of crime suspects, as well as the determination of blood sample age. Knowing the difference in the concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood of healthy adults of two ethnic groups, Caucasian (CA) and African American (AA), and taking into account the distribution pattern, the authors mimicked the samples of different ethnic origins with appropriate CK/LDH concentrations. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The study aims to explore global and local spatial autocorrelation and characterize the way crime activities are located in three coastal cities. Using three crime types (Burglary, Larceny, and Auto theft) in the cities of Mobile, Alabama and Pensacola, Florida, as well as Miami, Florida over the years 2005–2006, we compute a global spatial autocorrelation statistic, as well as local Moran autocorrelation statistics (Moran scatterplot) in order to detect clusters of high and low crime rates. Results showed high in global spatial autocorrelation statistic in three cities. Also, all three crimes show significant spatial autocorrelation at local level.

AB  - The rise in prescription drug abuse is changing crime patterns among drug users and the structure of illegal drug markets. The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. Our study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. Our findings indicate that individuallevel characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed. © 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article introduces a new approach to the analysis of changes in sex offender residences over time. Using a Markov chain framework, we analyze residential movement patterns of registered sex offenders in Hamilton County, Ohio, over a three-year period (2005-2007). Results indicate a 46 percent reduction in offenders violating spatial restriction zone policy as compared to a counterfactual case where offenders move as a function of housing distributions. Strong legacy effects are also found as offenders previously in violation of restriction policies move into other restricted zones at a higher rate than offenders who were previously in compliance with the policy. Parcels that previously were home to registered offenders also continue to attract offenders in future periods. Although we find differences in the probabilities of attracting offenders for parcels outside and inside restricted zones that are consistent with offender restrictive policies, these differences are actually significantly smaller than what holds under the counterfactual. Parcels in restricted zones continue to attract offenders at a higher rate than expected, despite the policy restrictions. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders’ target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders’ searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes. © 2014 SAGE Publications.

AB  - It is important to know about patterns of sexual behaviors among married couples in order to develop effective HIV prevention strategies for them. Herein we describe the sexual behaviors, estimate prevalence of anal intercourse (AI) among truck drivers (“truckers”) and their wives, and determine partner-specific demographic and behavioral correlates of AI. We carried out a cluster-sampled cross-sectional survey among 18–49 year-old wives and their trucker husbands in a south Indian district. Data were collected by same-gender research team members with color-coded computer-assisted interviews. We used random intercept logistic regression to identify the independent correlates of AI. Thirteen percent of 475 wives and 467 truckers reported ever having AI with their spouse. Of those who responded, 55 % of 40 wives and 47 % of 36 truckers never used condoms during AI. Of those who responded, 22 of 32 wives and 24 of 32 husbands felt that condoms were unnecessary during AI. Reporting ever having AI was associated with younger age and higher education of both husband and wife. AI reported by wives was associated with having sexual partner(s) other than husband (adjusted OR 8.8 [95 % CI 3.2–24.0]), correctly answering all HIV knowledge items (adjusted OR 4.9 [95 % CI 1.9–12.5]), husband’s sexual debut occurring before marriage (adjusted OR 1.9 [95 % CI 1.0–3.5]), and husband’s high HIV risk perception (adjusted OR 2.5 [95 % CI 1.2–5.4]). AI reported by truckers was associated with having sex with a male or transgender (adjusted OR 4.0 [95 % CI 1.2–13.3]). Reported prevalence of AI was high considering that in India anal sex is non-normative, heavily stigmatized and, criminal. Indian heterosexual mobile populations need to be informed about the greater risk of HIV infection consequent to unprotected AI. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime. © 2011 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes. Building on crime pattern theory and combining information from police records and other sources, this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in. In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago. The theoretical implications of these findings and their use for investigative purposes are discussed, and suggestions for future inquiry are made. © 2010 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Although the murders committed by serial killers may not be considered rational, there is growing evidence that the locations in which they commit their crimes may be guided by an implicit, if limited rationality. The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time. Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Following Youngjohn, Lees-Haley, and Binder's (1999) comment on Johnson and Lesniak-Karpiak's (1997) study that warnings lead to more subtle malingering, researchers have sought to better understand warning effects. However, such studies have been largely atheoretical and may have confounded warning and coaching. This study examined the effect on malingering of a warning that was based on criminological-sociological concepts derived from the rational choice model of deterrence theory. A total of 78 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unwarned simulator group, or one of two warned simulator groups. The warning groups comprised low- and high-level conditions depending on warning intensity. Simulator participants received no coaching about how to fake tests. Outcome variables were scores derived from the Test of Memory Malingering and Wechsler Memory Scale-III. When the rate of malingering was compared across the four groups, a high-level warning effect was found such that warned participants were significantly less likely to exaggerate than unwarned simulators. In an exploratory follow-up analysis, the warned groups were divided into those who reported malingering and those who did not report malingering, and the performance of these groups was compared to that of unwarned simulators and controls. Using this approach, results showed that participants who were deterred from malingering by warning performed no worse than controls. However, on a small number of tests, self-reported malingerers in the low-level warning group appeared less impaired than unwarned simulators. This pattern was not observed in the high-level warning condition. Although cautious interpretation of findings is necessitated by the exploratory nature of some analyses, overall results suggest that using a carefully designed warning may be useful for reducing the rate of malingering. The combination of some noteworthy effect sizes, despite low power and the small size of some groups, suggests that further investigation of the effects of warnings needs to continue to determine their effect more fully. © 2010 Psychology Press.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between pre-operational etiological diagnosis of medically intractable hemifacial spasm (HFS) and patterns of offending vessels and the curative effect of microvascular decompression (MVD). METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients with medically intractable HFS underwent MVD under general anesthesia. Pre-operative MRI examination was made for all cases to exclude space occupying lesion and magnetic imaging tomographic angiography (MRTA) was conducted for 145 cases of them instead of routine MRI. RESULTS: Routine MRI failed to provide information about offending vessels except for ruling out mass lesions whereas MRTA revealed the offending vessels with a positive rate of 82.8%, thus helping make correct diagnosis and operation decision. Follow-up of more than two years showed that the surgical intervention achieved a high relief rate of 91.2% without major complication, and with a low recurrence rate of only 3.5% after averaging more than two years' follow-up. CONCLUSION: Pre-operative MRTA can replace conventional MRI as a best approach for pre-operational etiological diagnosis of facial spasm. It helps perceive the offending vessels before operation. Skilled microsurgical technique along with correct recognition and mobilization of offending vessels are a must to assure MVD a high efficacious and low risk treatment of choice for HFS patients.

AB  - Unlike in conventional networks, node positions in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) usually change over time. As a side effect of managing routes, routing protocols to some extent also disseminate neighborship and topology information in the network, thereby disclosing at least some information on a node's own position to other nodes. Due to the wireless nature of ad hoc networks, this information can become available even to third parties which are not participating in the network. Using this information, location profiling may become possible, where attackers gather information on node positions or mobility patterns. This information may then be used for anything ranging from targeted advertisement to criminal activities. Therefore, location privacy is an important issue in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we analyze to what extent an attacker can track the precise location of a node, assuming a powerful attacker model where an attacker knows all neighbor relationships plus information on node distances. We present a new approach which uses these information and uses geometric constraints and heuristics to find node positions efficiently. The quality of our results is discussed and compared to other approaches. Based on the localization precision that such an "omniscient" attacker can reach, we will be able to evaluate the quality of future, more realistic attack models. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Although the study of both offense processes and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender's decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as "irrational" and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders. Implications of the results are briefly discussed in regard of clinical practice and crime prevention. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Mobility is related to problematic hard drug use. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the availability of care facilities attracts drug users. The aim of the study is to gain insight into the mobility of problematic hard drug users, with particular focus on the possibilities for deconcentration of facilities. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used: a survey and in-depth interviews with problematic hard drug users. The results show that the extent of mobility is not related to specific characteristics of the target group. The most relevant concepts related to possible deconcentration/displacement of problematic drug users are the nature of mobility and visibility of the users. A high level of mobility does not necessarily lead to more visibility and nuisance. Having a structured daily pattern (housing and/or working) largely determines visibility. More purposeful movement of drug users is associated with a lower level of visibility and nuisance. Mobility of users is strongly determined by the need to buy drugs. Low-threshold facilities are not a trigger for mobility as such, and need to be located near places where drug users stay and/or close to well-known dealing areas. © 2007 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Previous academic research has identified the correlation between special events and crime rates within cities. However, in much of the previous work, the focus was either on spatial or temporal analysis related to the evolution of local crime patterns in conjunction with the special events. This research uses a hybrid agent-based simulation to examine the impact of temporal pulse events on the criminal site selection process. The simulation provides researchers with a method for adjusting both the temporal and spatial patterns in response to a series of a-priori special events. Using the data from this simulation, we illustrate the effectiveness of a new modeling approach. Initial results show that adding a hierarchical framework to a feature-space regression model improves crime prediction accuracy and offers the law enforcement analyst better insight into both the temporal and spatial considerations of criminals. Improving the ability of law enforcement to identify, and prepare for, spatial-temporal shifts in crime patterns will significantly enhance proactive policing operations and resource allocation planning in support of large special events.

AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed.

AB  - Homeless youth are a diverse population of at risk adolescents and young adults who experience various negative health outcomes, including drug dependence, drug overdose, infectious diseases, and victimization. Previous studies have been directed toward understanding subgroups of homeless youth, such as injection drug users (IDUs) and young men who have sex with men (YMSM); yet limited research has focused on describing homeless travelers, a migratory subgroup of homeless youth who move from city to city. Based upon a larger three site study of young IDUs recruited in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York, a total of 133 travelers were identified. A subsample of 56 travelers participated in follow-up interviews, and provided data points for mapping. Travelers in all sites had extensive histories of criminal justice involvement and injection drug use. Four common traveling routes within and across the United States were identified. Reasons for traveling often related to drug use, money-making opportunities, and law enforcement. Risk-reduction services, such as shelters, syringe exchanges, or HIV/HCV testing, were used infrequently or occasionally. Mapping data documents the mobility of young IDUs across both urban and rural areas, which suggests that migration among IDUs across broad geographic regions may be a factor in the spread of blood-borne viruses. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This article discusses a specific crime - assault - usually registered in domicile victimization surveys, as compared to stealing and robberies. It debates whether rational choice theory is suitable to understand crimes as registered in theses surveys. As far as assault is concerned, this theory is unable to explain the association between social context and victimization risk, markedly different for women and men, as well as more linked to power and recognition than to material gains or assets. Furthermore, the differences between feminine and masculine patterns of victimization by assault could not be interpreted only by the commonly used theory of the patriarchal family, and should be illuminated by recent changes in urban life, family patterns and in the construction of masculine identities and practices, as suggested by the theories of hyper masculinity or warrior ethos. This may be useful for changing public policies aiming prevention of violence in interpersonal relationships.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to consider how the national intelligence model (NIM) of policing in Britain has been affected by changing patterns of mobility, since its inception in 2004. Conceptually, the paper draws on the “new mobilities paradigm”. Empirically, it is based on a small, exploratory study, comprising analysis of investigations carried out over a three-month period in 2007 and 2008, by a serious and organised crime unit in a police force in England, and 11 interviews carried out in three police forces in England. The data are used for illustrative purposes only. It is argued that increased levels of mobile criminality are impacting significantly on British police forces, placing considerable strain on the practical structures which underpin the NIM, and posing serious challenges to operational efficiency and effectiveness. This paper makes a contribution by linking the social changes documented in the emergent social science field of “mobilities study” with changes in the organisation of criminality, particularly evident in the organisation of mobile criminality, which have presented routine opportunities for organised, transnational as well as “lower level” crime. Examining this phenomenon enables us to see that despite the attention paid to transnational policing in the organised crime literature, the burden of policing both organised and opportunistic crime continues to fall upon local police forces. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - In examining the political consequences of government countermeasures designed to combat terrorism and the policy outcomes that change democratic institutions, processes, and values, this volume addresses two important but often-neglected questions: What are the political consequences of counterterrorism measures taken by liberal democracies and the international institutions that link them? And how severe are the negative effects of counterterrorism on civil liberties, the rule of law, and patterns of democratic governance? We focus here on advanced liberal democracies other than the United States in order to provide historical and comparative perspective.1 The effects of the American global war on terrorism have been studied extensively, but the discussion is not always situated in a broader international context.2 This volume does not deal specifically with the United States, but several of the chapters consider the American case within a comparative framework. Many of the discussions are also concerned with the divisions between the United States and Europe in dealing with contemporary terrorism. Also, since the shock of the 9/11 attacks, legal scholars have addressed the effects of counterterrorism much more energetically and thoroughly than have political scientists. This volume is the beginning of an effort to fill the gap in our understanding of the political as well as the legal impact of democratic responses to terrorism.3 Counterterrorism policy is controversial, and it is almost certain to become more so if governments continue to strengthen their response to terrorism. Democratic governments do not initiate counterterrorism policy with the express intent of undermining democracy, but they may be too ready to accept the idea of an inevitable trade-off between security and liberty; to think that because terrorists might exploit democracy, attractive "loopholes" must be closed; or to deny the real costs of counterterrorism. Fears of failing to prevent a disastrous terrorist attack causing a large loss of civilian lives may lead policymakers to take a shortsighted and overconfident view of the ability of robust security measures to prevent terrorism. The contributors to this volume agree that the effects of the response to terrorism have been costly to democracy in many ways, but that within certain broad outlines, policy consequences have differed in nature and severity. In general, policy changes since 2001 have been much more damaging to democracy than earlier counterterrorism measures, even as responses to the threat of Al Qaeda and its associated groups have usually not departed radically from counterterrorism policies of the past. A key consideration in analyzing these issues is the possibility that a government's response to terrorism will diminish democracy more than the acts of terrorism themselves. Liberal democracies confront painful policy choices: Terrorism is a threat that must be confronted in order to preserve the safety and security of the nation, but counterterrorist policies can diminish individual civil liberties and alter patterns of governance to the detriment of democracy. Measures designed to prevent terrorism often limit the basic rights and freedoms of citizens, invade their privacy, strengthen executive power, centralize police and intelligence bureaucracies, blur the distinction between domestic intelligence and law enforcement functions, expand the influence of the military in decisionmaking, cloak decisionmaking processes in secrecy, and encourage undemocratic shifts in public attitudes and political values (such as intolerance toward minorities or unquestioning acceptance of erosions of civil liberties).4 In fact, as John E. Finn's chapter notes, it is not a simple matter even to determine what national counterterrorism policies are. Their scope goes well beyond specifically labeled antiterrorism legislation, and counterterrorism regimes are constantly changing. Internationally, common strategies against terrorism can lead to closed borders and reliance on military force over criminal justice, as well as infringements of individual rights. Disagreements over how to deal with terrorism spark controversy and partisanship within and between nations. The Bush administration's pursuit of a global war on terror frustrated many allies-and where governments were supportive of the United States, their publics often were not. Risk perceptions and conceptions of "homeland security" diverge (Föhrenbach 2006). Many of the political consequences of counterterrorism efforts are unintended or secondary, although some cynical observers might suspect that governments, particularly officials of the executive branch, manipulate the threat of terrorism to expand their powers. The effects discussed here, however, seem frequently to have been unanticipated. In the heat of the moment of crisis, governments tend to act in haste without fully considering either the full scope of the alternative actions that are open to them or the consequences of that range of options. Lack of forethought and preparation produces decisions that are less than optimally rational, and publics have little chance to weigh in even if they have the inclination, expertise, and information to do so. There is insufficient check on what the government does. The question then is how enduring such changes are and whether they can be reversed if their effects are later judged harmful to democracy. This is a key element of the concept of proportionality of response to threat. Experiences and perceptions of the threat of terrorism vary considerably among countries, not just between the United States and the rest of the world, and responses differ according to the threat and according to context. Before the 9/11 attacks, the consensus was that democracies confronting internal threats or "domestic terrorism" were more likely to adopt policies that undermine democratic principles than were democracies facing terrorism originating from outside, or "international terrorism" (Charters 1994, 213-14). That is, states presumably react more harshly to civil violence from groups composed of their own citizens acting within their borders than to violence organized by foreigners or occurring outside the country. The implications of violent dissent from within seemed much more serious than the external threat of terrorist attack, which before 9/11 was considered minor and was in fact extremely rare. In general, terrorism was not a national security issue, although the Reagan administration took international terrorism quite seriously, blamed Soviet "state sponsorship" of terrorism as part of the Cold War rivalry, and bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan complicity in terrorism directed against American targets in West Germany. Since the American declaration of a war on terror, however, the argument that internal terrorism is most provocative can certainly no longer be sustained. It is also interesting to note that the European Union (EU) list of terrorist organizations makes a distinction between domestic groups and those with foreign affiliations or transnational ambitions, and that the two types are subject to different levels of sanctions (see chapter 3). Complicating matters, as we have come to recognize in the period since the 9/11 attacks, is the fact that many terrorist conspiracies are mixed in origin rather than exclusively internal or external, a point that Dirk Haubrich stresses in his chapter on the United Kingdom. Terrorist plots often involve a combination of citizens of the state and noncitizens or local operatives with external direction, resources, or inspiration.5 Many such plots are rooted in social and family networks that are transnational. These groups are not directed by states, although their leaders may seek refuge in lawless areas, ally themselves with weak regimes such as the Taliban, or seek support from diasporas located abroad. National borders are increasingly blurred and permeable, especially as electronic communications make it easier to organize underground conspiracies across continents and to publicize a group's ambitions worldwide to mobilize support and inspire imitation. Because some terror plots now emanate from sources formerly considered benign or inconsequential, expressions of religious faith or identity can seem alarming. Germany and Japan, for example, have removed protected religious status from some opposition groups charged with using or advocating terrorism. Britain also cracked down on mosques led by radical Islamist clerics who preached support for anti-Western terrorism, such as Abu Qatada, although Britain was relatively slow to act even after the 9/11 attacks. It has become harder to obtain such privileged status, but the long-term effects are still uncertain. One possibility is that radical activity will shift from mosques or on other public religious establishments to underground venues or onto the Internet. © 2010 by Russell Sage Foundation.

AB  - In the present study, geographic mobility exhibited by child sex offenders was examined. Geographic mobility was defined as the use of multiple locations to obtain repetitive sexual contact with the same victim. The sample consisted of 77 adult offenders convicted for having committed a sexual offence against a child, and who agreed to provide confidential self-report data concerning their offending behaviours. Based on a set of offence characteristics, offenders who used a single location were compared to offenders who used multiple locations for sexual contact. Results showed that offenders who used multiple locations are more likely to isolate the victim, use violence, involve the victim in several sexual episodes, abuse the victim for a period exceeding one year, and make the victim participate and perform sexual behaviours on them during sexual episodes. Examining more closely offenders who used multiple locations for abuse, three offence patterns were further identified (i.e., familial-low mobility offence, non familial-high mobility offence, and familial-high mobility offence). Going for a car ride was also found to be a common location/situation used in the familial-low mobility offence subgroup, while the use of outdoor locations on a regular basis was found to be rare in high mobility patterns subgroups. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Identification of the early determinants of substance abuse is a major focus of life course research. In this study, we investigated the child, family, and school-related antecedents of the onset and prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 for a cohort of 1208 low-income minority children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Data on well-being have been collected prospectively since birth from administrative records, parents, teachers, and children. Results indicated that the prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 was 26% (self-reports or criminal justice system records) with a median age of first use of 17. Probit regression analysis indicated that substance abuse prevalence was primarily determined by gender (males had a higher rate), trouble-making behavior by age 12, school mobility, and previous substance use. Family and peer predictors included involvement in the child welfare system by age 9, parent expectations for school success at age 9, parent substance abuse by child's age 15, and deviant peer affiliation by age 16. Age of first substance use was predicted by gender and race/ethnicity (males and Blacks had earlier incidence), involvement in the child welfare system, and family risk status at age 8. As with prevalence, the pattern of predictors for males was similar to the overall sample but the magnitude of effects was stronger. The predictors of the timing of substance use dependency were gender, family conflict by age 5, involvement in the child welfare system, social maturity at age 9, adolescent school mobility, and school dropout by age 16. Findings indicate that the promotion of family involvement and positive school and social behaviors can reduce the risk of substance abuse. © 2010.

AB  - A new era of mass immigration, accelerating since the 1970s and largely coming from developing countries of Latin America and Asia, has transformed the ethnic composition of the U.S. population. Today about 70 million people are of foreign birth or parentage-23 percent of all Americans, including 90 percent of all Asians and 76 percent of all Hispanics (Portes and Rumbaut 2006). They include nearly 70 million foreign-born persons-of whom 12 million are estimated to be undocumented immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Central America (Passell 2006)-and another 40 million of foreign parentage. This immigrant-stock population, the largest ever, is a youthful one-and todays U.S.-born second generation, with a median age of twelve, is poised to explode into adulthood in the coming ten to twenty years. They are coming of age in an otherwise aging society undergoing profound social and economic transformations, a process that is straining the social contract between natives and newcomers and raising questions about how the commitment to democratic values of equity and inclusion will be met (Myers 2007; Tienda 2002). The incorporation of these newcomers has coincided with a postindustrial period of economic restructuring and rising inequality, during which the returns to education and advanced educational credentials have sharply increased. Simultaneously, the U.S. labor market has become bifurcated into high-tech/high-wage and manual/low-wage sectors-attracting distinct streams of immigrant workers, from skilled professionals to undocumented laborers. As the post-World War II era of sustained economic growth, low unemployment, and rising real wages ended for most workers by the early 1970s, men with only a high-school degree or less were hardest hit. For example, the proportion of those workers who failed to earn enough in a year to support a family of four at the poverty line grew between 1975 and 1993 from 25 to 50 percent among Hispanics, from 31 to 45 percent among non-Hispanic blacks, and from 14 to 24 percent among non-Hispanic whites (Danziger 2004). Postsecondary schooling significantly lengthened for young people, with the years from eighteen to the mid- and even late twenties becoming increasingly devoted, often with continuing parental support, to the accumulation of human capital and college credentials. Many changes occurred at this time-women entered the labor market in large numbers and worked longer hours, two-income families became the norm, and the baby boom was followed by a baby bust and delayed childbearing. Additionally, there were changes in family forms, including what has come to be called a "retreat from marriage," with high divorce rates (which peaked in 1980 but have remained high since) and sharp increases in cohabitation and nonmarital childbearing (Landale et al. 2006). In short, social timetables that were widely observed a half century ago for accomplishing adult transitions have become less predictable and more prolonged, diverse, and disordered (Settersten et al. 2005). The new era of mass immigration has also coincided with an era of mass imprisonment in the United States, which has further transformed paths to adulthood among young men with low levels of education (Pettit and Western 2004). The number of adults incarcerated in federal or state prisons or local jails in the United States skyrocketed during this period, quadrupling from over 500,000 in 1980 to 2.2 million in 2005 (U.S. Department of Justice 2006). The majority are young men between eighteen and thirty-four. Those figures do not include the much larger number of those on probation (convicted offenders not incarcerated) or parole (under community supervision after a period of incarceration). When they are added to the incarceration totals, over 7 million adults were under correctional supervision in the United States in 2006. Imprisonment rates vary widely by gender (over 90 percent of inmates in federal and state prisons are men); by racial-ethnic groups (there were 4,834 black male prisoners per 100,000 black males in the United States, compared to 1,778 Hispanic males per 100,000 and 681 white males per 100,000, although since 1985 Hispanics have been the fastest growing group being imprisoned); and by education. This is most salient among racial minorities for whom becoming a prisoner has become a modal life event in early adulthood. Stunningly, as Pettit and Western (2004) have noted, a black male high school dropout born in the late 1960s had a nearly 60 percent chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s, and recent birth cohorts of black men are more likely to have prison records than military records or bachelors degrees. Whether the future of Latino men without a high school diploma will approximate those patterns or not remains an open empirical question. During the years of the transition to adulthood from the late teens through the twenties, as postsecondary educational attainment has become critical to social mobility for both men and women, incarceration (for young men) and early childbearing (for young women) have emerged as two turning points- albeit fundamentally different ones-that can derail life course trajectories by blocking or disrupting educational and occupational opportunities to develop human capital and move into the economic mainstream. Having a prison record is not only linked to unemployment, lower wages, marital and family instability, and severe restrictions on social and voting rights (including lifetime disenfranchisement in many states), but also to stigmatized identities and pathways to criminal recidivism (Laub and Sampson 2003). In a cycle of cumulative disadvantage, young men and women with low levels of education are significantly more likely to become prisoners or young parents, respectively, than same-age and same-sex peers with higher levels of education. © 2010 by Rutgers University Press.

AB  - Biometric recognition refers to an automatic recognition of individuals based on a feature vectors derived from their physiological and/or behavioral characteristic. Among the various Biometric methods, Face recognition has become one of the most challenging tasks in the pattern recognition field in the past decades. Probably it is the most common biometric characteristic used by humans. Face recognition is very important for many applications such as: video surveillance, criminal investigations and forensic applications, secure electronic banking, mobile phones, credit cards, secure access to buildings. For identifying individual in international traffic points, in access control and in many other fields it is very useful. At international traffic points, such as at the airport, where continuous search for a particular person is possible with the help of this system. With the help of smart cameras we can track and identify the person . In this paper we propose a novel face recognition method based on wavelet transform and fast discrete curvelet transform. Initially Wavelet transform is applied to the query image to get the subbands and then curvelet transform is applied for each subband images. Thus curvelet coefficients for each wavelet subbands are obtained. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Prediction of uncertain trajectories in moving objects databases has recently become a new paradigm for tracking wireless and mobile devices in an accurate and efficient manner, and is critical in law enforcement applications such as criminal tracking analysis. However, existing approaches for prediction in spatio-temporal databases focus on either mining frequent sequential patterns at a certain geographical position, or constructing kinematical models to approximate real-world routes. The former overlooks the fact that movement patterns of objects are most likely to be local, and constrained in some certain region, while the later fails to take into consideration some important factors, e.g., population distribution, and the structure of traffic networks. To cope with those problems, we propose a general trajectory prediction algorithm called E3TP (an Effective, Efficient, and Easy Trajectory Prediction algorithm), which contains four main phases: (i) mining ″hotspot″ regions from moving objects databases; (ii) discovering frequent sequential routes in hotspot areas; (iii) computing the speed of a variety of moving objects; and (iv) predicting the dynamic motion behaviors of objects. Experimental results demonstrate that E3TP is an efficient and effective algorithm for trajectory prediction, and the prediction accuracy is about 30% higher than the naive approach. In addition, it is easy-to-use in realworld scenarios.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Criminal opportunity in most cases is constrained by the fact that motivated offenders and potential targets or victims are not found at the same place at the same time. This ecological fact necessitates that offenders, potential victims, or both move into spatial positions that make crimes physically possible. This chapter develops a series of simple mathematical and agent-based models looking at the relationship between basic movement decisions and emergent crime patterns in two-dimensional environments. It is shown that there may be substantial regularities to crime patterns, including the tendency for crime to form discrete hotspots that arise solely from different movement strategies deployed by offenders. © 2008, IGI Global.

AB  - For at least a century, the United States has enjoyed unbridled prosperity. True, there have been significant interruptions in the upward course of per capita growth, most notably during the Great Depression. Although we could not always answer positively to Ronald Reagan's famous 1980 presidential debate question, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" most of us are unambiguously better off than our grandparents were fifty years ago, or their grandparents fifty years earlier.1 The distribution of prosperity, however, unlike the aggregate, has not followed a monotonic path. The broad outline of what happened is easy to summarize. Inequality in income and wealth decreased for much of the twentieth century. The decrease in inequality appeared to fit the hypothesis of Simon Kuznets (1955): As industrialization led a larger fraction of the population to enter high-productivity activities, inequality fell. The fall in inequality, however, has been arrested and reversed. When inequality started to rise depends on which measure one uses, but the reversal did not start before the late 1960s and was clearly in full bloom before-not after-Reagan took office. In this essay, I document that the long-run trend in inequality-decreasing for roughly the first three-quarters of the twentieth century and increasing thereafter-is matched by similar trends in public policy and political polarization, and I discuss the implications of these parallel trends. I focus on public policies, such as taxes and minimum wages, that are tied to inequality, since they are explicitly redistributive. For example, David Lee (1999, 979) finds that "almost all of the growth in the wage gap between the tenth and fiftieth percentile is attributable to the erosion of the real value of the federal minimum during the [1980s]." Estate taxes became more onerous for the first three-quarters of the century before reversing in the late 1970s. Top marginal income taxes increased before starting a decline in the 1960s. The federal minimum wage took root in 1938 and increased, in real terms, until the late 1960s but then declined precipitously. I later document in more detail how minimum wages and taxes closely tracked the secular pattern of inequality. As inequality among Americans fell during the first two-thirds or three-quarters of the twentieth century, Americans also seemed to have grown closer together politically. In 1960 the sociologist Daniel Bell published The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties. A year later the political scientist Robert Dahl (1961) pointed to a nation moving from oligarchy to pluralism. Similarly, the new "rational choice" school in political science emphasized Tweedle-Dee-Tweedle-Dum parties focused on the median voter (Downs 1957) and members of Congress largely concerned with constituency service (Fiorina 1978) and universalism in pork barrel politics (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). What these authors pointed to was echoed in analyses of roll-call voting patterns in the House and Senate. Put simply, the fraction of moderates grew and the fraction of extreme liberals and extreme conservatives fell from 1900 to about 1975 (Poole and Rosenthal 1997; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 1997). Just as inequality went from falling to rising in the last quarter of the century, we witnessed a turnaround in politics. Keith Poole and I have termed this "the polarization of American politics" (Poole and Rosenthal 1984; see also Krugman 2002a, 2002b). Moderates are nearly extinct. Extreme liberals and extreme conservatives have surfaced, particularly extreme conservatives in the Republican Party. What, more precisely, are the changes in partisan positions that underlie polarization? The Republican Party in Congress moves from a very conservative position in 1900 to a substantially more moderate position in the 1970s before rebounding to 1900 conservatism in 2000. The Democratic Party becomes more moderate until the 1950s and then drifts, relatively slowly, to a more liberal position. The net effect of these changes is that the differences between the parties-polarization- narrow until the 1970s and then expand. My main focus-stimulated by the parallel trends in economic inequality, political polarization, and public policy-is on how politics and economic inequality relate and are coupled by economic policy. There is, in this respect, an abundance of alternative hypotheses about the rise of inequality. The list includes greater trade liberalization, increased levels of immigration, declining rates of trade unionization, the fall in the real minimum wage, a decline in progressive taxation, technological change increasing the returns to education, the increased rates of family dissolution and female-headed households, the aging of the population, pure racism, America's federal political system, gridlocked national politics, and the absence of proportional representation in elections (for an overview of some of these topics, see Atkinson 1997; see also Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacredote 2001). Most of these factors are either directly political or potentially affected by public policy. Technological change, however, would appear to respond to many forces that are independent of government policy. Similarly, the decline of marriage is universal throughout the Western world. The roots of this may be just as much in technological changes that affect work in the household and in changes in lifestyle as in the changes in incentives produced through welfare and other public policies. Nonetheless, politics and public policy remain the focus of this essay. An important aspect of the increase in inequality is that it has indeed taken place during a period of substantial economic growth. Although the quadrupling, from 1970 to 2000, of the proportion of the population who are incarcerated (Western, Kleykamp, and Rosenfeld, this volume) suggests that many African American males may not be better off than their grandparents, by and large the increase in inequality is not a matter of pauperization. 2 Although there is debate as to whether the lower end of the income distribution is somewhat worse off or has remained relatively stable in economic status, it has pretty clearly not gotten much worse off. Moreover, a substantial segment of the lower tail consists of immigrants who are much better off than they were in their nation of origin. At the same time, in the middle and at the top end of the income distribution, voters have become much richer. This is not just because the growth rate of income at each centile has been increasing in the centile. The poor who are eligible to vote increasingly vote less than the rich. In addition, nonvoting legal and illegal immigrants tend to be poor. Another factor, but quantitatively less important than immigration, arises from growth in the number of incarcerated Americans and ineligible ex-felons (on both criminals and immigrants in voter turnout, see McDonald and Popkin 2001). Prosperity, immigration, and criminal justice policy combine to mute the political response to inequality. This chapter proposes an account of the political and institutional forces that are likely to blunt a movement toward redistributive economic policies. Rising wealth and incomes have created a sizable constituency with a vested interest in the status quo, while the growing share of noncitizens and disenfranchised ex-offenders reduces the political power of the poor. As I discuss later, these shifts in the electorate take place in the context of institutional features of the American political system that give economic policies a kind of "stickiness," particularly given the polarization discussed earlier. Once established, economic policies that affect the distribution of income tend to be slow to change. The essay proceeds as follows. A theoretical overview of the political economy of inequality is provided in the next section. This section also briefly applies the theoretical perspective to an understanding of events in the twentieth century. In the following section, I make some international comparisons and highlight how the Great Depression, World War II, and the 1960s represented exceptional events for the United States. I suggest how politics might be relevant to differences in inequality across nations. In the next section, I document the polarization of politics in the United States. The following section links that political polarization to outcomes in income and wealth inequality and immigration. That is followed by a section in which I argue that increases in aggregate income and wealth and in immigration are acting to mute any political response to inequality. Finally, I show how changes in public policies on taxes and minimum wages correspond with changes in inequality and political polarization. This section also emphasizes that old-age insurance taxes follow an entirely different pattern from taxation that is explicitly redistributive. Copyright © 2004 by Russell Sage Foundation.

AB  - The analysis of spatial information has long been considered valuable for police agency within the criminal investigative process. This is especially true for serial crime cases where criminologists and psychologist apply geographical profiling to model criminal mobility distribution and behavior patterns in order to estimate a criminal's likely residence. In recent years the availability of advanced computational mathematic tools ensured us to establish some mathematical models to replace traditional empirical method. However, as a new technology, current geographical profiling models are still fundamental and impractical. In this article, based on existing frameworks, we establish three new methodologies, namely, Bayesian- Factor analysis model, Time series analysis model and GIS(Geographic Information System)-Decay model, to study geographical profiling problems. Then, we test and compare their accuracy, efficiency, sensitivity and robust according to 11 historical serial crime samples and Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we discuss the advantage and disadvantage of each model and provide executive guidelines about how to synthetically apply these models for real cases. © 2012 Academy Publisher.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This article examines the possibility of using the ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) to discern the difference between persons who distribute cocaine and those who do not distribute cocaine based on their patterns of cocaine contamination. Criminal justice practitioners who monitor offenders rely primarily upon urinalysis to detect drug use by their clientele. However, since drug distribution is a profitable enterprise for many, persons may continue to engage in drug sales even after desisting from use. In this paper we attempt to determine whether or not a distinct contamination profile exists for persons who admit continued involvement in drug sales and drug sales and use when contrasted to those who deny drug sales but continue to use or deny any drug involvement whatsoever. The findings of our examination and analysis are only moderately supportive of the discernable difference between users and distributors but sufficient, in our view, to continue examining the technology for a potential application to this problem.

AB  - Contrary to the myth of a consensual heyday of policing, its origins are to be explained as a response more to pressing political and social challenges than to long-standing problems of daily criminality. The threat, real or imagined, confronted by successive governments had a major impact on the style of policing adopted. Threats to established states and the fear of communism after the Bolshevik Revolution led to the expansion of political policing in both democratic and authoritarian regimes. In Argentina, political policing came to dominate police and military activities. The need for it was believed to stem from the country's contentious nature, rooted in the foreign origins of its population. Social mobilization in Argentina was triggered before the new political institutions could attain a high level of legitimacy, aggravating the elite perception of civil strife as threatening the social order. The absence of a directly threatening external enemy and the limited character of wars may have coalesced to draw the army into the civilian realm. It is beyond the scope of this article to delve into other factors that led the armed forces to expand their role, such as the military mentality, authoritarian ideology, and fear of the popular classes. Certainly, its physical presence throughout the country and its involvement in the development of the economy and infrastructure gave it broader national scope than the police. In any event, the form of policing and police organization varied as a function of the place of the military in Argentina's history of contentious politics. As I have shown, the 1930 coup increased the repressiveness of the regime and spurred military intervention in policing. That is reflected in the recruitment pattern of the chiefs of police and ideological definitions of the enemy. From 1880, when the capital police was created, until September 1955, when Peron was ousted, 30 of 47 chiefs of police had been military men, most of them in active service.

AB  - According to routine activities theory, crime is the result of an intersection between victims and offenders in both time and space. We introduce a spatial typology that identifies five combinations of victim and offender mobility to homicide incident locations: internal, predatory, intrusion, offense mobility, and total mobility types. The authors' argue that the joint mobility pattern of the victim and off ender is the mechanism underlying routine activities theory, and made explicit by the spatial typology. Using information on the 420 homicides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between 1987 and 1995, we demonstrate that the majority of homicides involve at least some mobility on the part of victims and/or offenders. Our results also indicate that mobility to homicide incident locations is most associated with event characteristics such as motive, rather than with characteristics of the participants. With most offenders committing the homicide outside of their own neighborhood, levels of lethal violence in a community are influenced more by the interaction among nonlocal participants than by the violent actions of local residents. © 2005 Sage Publications.

AB  - Targeting repeat victimization comprises a way of achieving effectiveness, efficiency and equity in crime prevention. Research has found that victimization leads to increased risk of further victimization, especially in the short term; that ‘hot spots’ have a disproportionate number of repeat victims; and that repeat offences tend to be committed by prolific offenders. The development of successful crime reduction tactics and strategies also requires detailed attention to the mechanisms through which patterns are generated and may be disrupted, and the contexts relevant to differing mechanisms. Inattention to these is liable to lead to the implementation of ineffective measures or measures with counterproductive unintended consequences. Four generic approaches appear to have particular promise in devising effective crime reduction initiatives, including those targeting repeat victimization: situational analysis and problem-solving; cumulative protective intervention; synthesis of prevention, detection and disruption; and near neighbour mobilization. © 2005, A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - This study investigates target selection scripts of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sex crimes on stranger victims. Using latent class analysis, three target selection scripts were identified based on the victim's activities prior to the crime, each presenting two different tracks: (1) the Home script, which includes the (a) intrusion track and the (b) invited track, (2) the Outdoor script, which includes the (a) noncoercive track and the (b) coercive track, and (3) the Social script, which includes the (a) onsite track and the (b) off-site track. The scripts identified appeared to be used by both sexual aggressors of children and sexual aggressors of adults. In addition, a high proportion of crime switching was found among the identified scripts, with half of the 72 offenders switching scripts at least once. The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Improving our understanding of the differentials, articulation and mobility of criminal offending within and between urban and rural areas may ultimately have important policy implications for the allocation of valuable federal, state and local resources. This paper introduces a new comprehensive place level system delineation, which corresponds directly to meaningful police jurisdictional coverage areas. This coverage allows for the implementation of a multivariate spatial econometric technique that has the potential to contribute to law enforcement's ability to combat criminal offending through the introduction of an algorithm for the tracking of the almost 'real time' spatial mobility of crime. The results suggest a more robust application of spatial clustering statistics in identifying spatio-temporal relationships in the spatial mobility of crime. It is expected that the ability to track criminal offending in a more 'real-time' manner can have direct implications on future research concerned with the simulation of crime-specific offending patterns. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This research fulfills a void in offender mobility discourse. Metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure, defined in crime pattern theory as the urban backcloth, plays a significant role in shaping travel behavior; and yet, current analysis of offender mobility continues to favor individual characteristics to account for travel range. Methods: Using a large sample of juveniles, both delinquent and at-risk youth (N = 2,552), this study compared the predictive utility of individual characteristics against indicators of urban backcloth. Results: Delinquent youth were found to be more sensitive to the environmental conditions exerted by community-level socioeconomic characteristics than their at-risk counterparts. However, two factors-intercity hierarchical structure and motor vehicle access-accounted for travel variability among all youth. Conclusions: Offending behavior must be examined within the context of a dynamic environmental context formed by the metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure. Delinquents constitute an identifiable subgroup of youth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

AB  - Introduction: Although the characteristics of the adolescent stage favor the emergence of disruptive behaviors, not all adolescents engage in them in equal degree. For the majority of adolescents, the problematic behaviors are limited to an experimentation period and are temporary. However, for some individuals, the first contacts with the disruptive behavior progress to more severe antisocial behavior patterns. The progression of the dissocial behavior from the childhood to the adolescence seems related to a difficult temperament, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, improper relationships with peers, precocious sexuality, poor parent-adolescent communication, arrests by delinquency and repetition. Traditionally, the dissocial behavior has been associated with low socioeconomic status, lack of public services, unemployment, marginalization and schools with unsuitable educational programs. However, current conceptualizations view this problem as much more complex. In communities that have covered the basic needs, even in those that possess a good quality of life, we can find children and adolescents with dissocial behavior that thereinafter become adults with antisocial personality. Therefore, during the last decades, research has displaced its attention from the structural variables to community (lack of attachment with the vicinity, social mobility, and population density), family (bonding, communication, supervision) and personal processes, favoring a biopsychosocial perspective to this problem. The aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model of dissocial behavior (as defined by the 27-item Dissocial Behavior Scale, ECODI27) based on the following predictor variables: a) Parent communication (Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale, PACS), b) Empathy (Interpersonal Relationship Index, IRI), c) Assertiveness (Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, RAS), d) Sensation seeking (Sensation Seeking Scale - Form V, SSS-V) and e) Risk socialization (Social Relationship Questionnaire, SRQ, created for this study) controlling for the impression management effect (Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding-version 6, BIDR-6). Method: A probability sample of adolescents, 14 to 17 years of age, living in two neighborhoods with high indexes of gangs and offenses was collected. Males were 112 and women 86, without statistical difference of frequencies (χ2 [1,N=196]=3.41, p=.06). All participants resided in San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Pearson's productmoment correlation, partial correlation and stepwise linear regression were used for data analysis. Results: There was a significant difference in dissocial behavior cases between male and female adolescents (χ2 [1,N=194]=14.75, p<.00), with Yates' correction: (χ2 [1,N=194]=12.59, p<.01). The percentage of cases is 18% in women and 45% in men. The total score of the 27-item Dissocial Behavior Scale (ECODI27) presented significant correlation with social desirability (.47 in men and .44 in women) and its factor of impression management (.53 in men and .47 in women). The self-deception factor was independent in men (r=.18, p=.06), but not in women (r=.26, p=.02). Higher dissocial behavior features were associated with lower scores on social desirability and its factors. The effect of the impression management factor had to be controlled for its statistical significance in men and women. Of the 18 variables of the social relationships questionnaire (SRQ) by the point-biserial correlation coefficient (dichotomic variables) and Pearson's product-moment correlation (ordinal and numerical variables), only four were significantly correlated to the ECODI27 total score: to belong (1) or not (2) to a gang outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.45, p<.01) and in the school (n=133, rpb=.35, p<.01), to have 1) or not 2) a friend group outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.20, p=.01), as well as to have 1) or not 2) a girlfriend or boyfriend in the school (n=131, rpb=.26, p=.02) and outside of the school and job (n=193, rpb=.18, p=.01). These correlations were positive, that is to say, acted as risk factors (lower score on ECODI27, more dissocial behavior). The variable of risk socialization was created with the sum of these five variables, giving more weight to the two variables of gangs by their higher correlations, so they are multiplied by two. The created variable has a range of 0 (not risk) to 7 (high risk). Of the 20 variables contemplated, nine presented significant correlation with dissocial behavior in men, after partializing the effect of the impression management: sensation seeking and its four factors (disinhibition, excitement seeking, emotion seeking and boredom susceptibility), risk socialization, total and open communication with the father and perspective taking. In women there were also nine significant variables: risk socialization, sensation seeking and its factors of disinhibition, boredom susceptibility and excitement seeking, total and open communication with the mother, total communication with the father and school grade. The regression models by sexes were calculated with the nine variables whose correlations with the ECODI27 total score resulted significant after partializing impression management. In men the calculation process ended in the fifth step. The model explained 49% of the variance of the ECODI27 total score and was significant (F [5,106]=21.99, p<.01). Five variables integrated the model: disinhibition (β=-.32), risk socialization (β=-.28), open communication with the father (β=.27), excitement seeking (β=-.20) and perspective taking (β=.16). In women the calculation process ended in the third step. The model explained 40% of the variance of the criterion and was significant (F [3,78]=19.38, p<.01). Three variables integrated it: total communication with the mother (β=.33), risk socialization (β=-32) and sensation seeking (β=-.28). Conclusions: The results of the present study can only be extrapolated to the population of the two studied neighborhoods and must be handled as generators of testable hypotheses in other similar populations. In addition, their self-report nature must be considered as an additional potential limitation. However, they indicate that the presence of dissocial behavior was high in the present sample, with an intermediate percentage (33%) between high school students (8.5%) and imprisoned offenders (50%). Risk socialization (engaging in gangs, friend group in the neighborhood and precocious sexuality), sensation seeking and little communication with the parent or tutor of the same sex than adolescent in men and women, as well as lack of perspective taking in men, were predictors of dissocial behavior. The sensation seeking was defined in the regression models by the SSS total score in women and by its factors of disinhibition and excitement seeking in men. These data make an attention call to the Council authorities of a propitiatory environment for dissocial behavior. From the obtained models, the intervention must be addressed to eradicate the phenomenon of the gangs; to encourage the internal control or planning and perspective taking in the pupils, through specific workshops within the school subjects of ethic or health care. They also call for the importance to work the open communication, above all with the parent or tutor of the same sex than the adolescent, through these workshops as well as during the meetings with the pupil's parents. Furthermore, to seek occupational-formative opportunities for those adolescents that have left the school seems critical, especially for those of 16-year-old or younger, considering the prohibition of working at that age.

AB  - Research on offender mobility is directed to three main elements: distance, anchor points, and direction. Previous research in geographical criminology has revealed that: (1) the journey to crime is limited in distance and follows a distance decay pattern; (2) the home of the offender plays a central role as the starting point of crime trips; and (3) the direction of the trip is influenced by the opportunities to commit crimes. The findings are more or less accepted as 'laws' in the field. However, research on offender mobility is often limited by its method, data and sample of arrested offenders. This study, in contrast, investigated a sample of arrested foreign offenders (East Europeans) who were staying temporarily in Belgium. They lack the space awareness and routine activities of residential offenders. Using multiple methods and data, including police statistics, case file analysis and offender interviews, we investigated the travelling patterns of these offenders both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings demonstrate that: (1) the degree of distance decay is much more moderate than generally found in the literature; (2) the official living address plays hardly any role at all as an anchor point; and (3) these offenders travel away from opportunity structures, which is different from the routine activity patterns of Belgian offenders. Overall, our findings indicate that offender mobility does not fit the accepted general pattern or 'laws' as assumed in previous research. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the U. S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we use police recorded crime data and purchase price information to investigate patterns in property stolen during domestic burglaries. We test the hypotheses that frequently stolen items are 'CRAVED' (Clarke 1999) and that the levels at which items are stolen vary over time, according to a product's position in the consumer goods life cycle of innovation, growth, mass market, saturation (Felson and Clarke 1998). We focus on audio-visual equipment and mobile telephones, comparing the trends with those for cash. The results show that the prevalence of theft of the products considered has changed significantly over the period studied, consistent with the life cycle hypothesis. The crime prevention implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for further research considered. © the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (ISTD) 2005; all rights reserved.

AB  - The urban infrastructure plays a critical role in shaping the landscape of crime. Explaining the linkage between urban planning and crime patterns, Brantingham and Brantingham (1998b) argue that the spatial array and context of facilities (i.e., placement, juxtaposition, operation, and accessibility through high-volume traffic conduits) can account for the criminogenic capacity of certain places. Aggregating the usage of such places provides some indication of the dynamic interplay between the spatial and social context of the urban landscape that gives rise to crime patterns. Complicating the equation is the need to model the urban backcloth - the political, legal, and economic forces behind community planning and development - that generates the urban form, which ultimately shapes individual behaviors. It follows that crime problems can be better understood, and more effectively acted upon, by attending to the urban structure generated by routine behavior endemic to a specific region. © 2012 Martin A.

AB  - Although research has been done on serial murder cases in general, unsolved serial murder cases have rarely been investigated. Offenders who elude identification offer little evidence for clearing cases. Thus, similarities among serial murder cases, and even more specifically among unsolved cases, need to be empirically explored to identify advantageous techniques as preventive measures against future serial murderers. This study includes two sets of data, one consisting of 399 solved and a second constituting 75 unsolved serial murder cases. In an attempt to differentiate unsolved from solved cases, five variables-rate of killing, vulnerability, body disposal, location of body disposal, and mobility-are used. Statistically significant results supporting the hypotheses are found for the first three variables. © 1999 Sage Publications, Inc.

AB  - Information is arguably the most sought after commodity in today's society. Both companies and individuals rely on it constantly in order to accomplish their daily activities. Advertising agencies, online stores and social networking websites gather as much data they can about their targeted users. The police could also gather information about places prone to criminal activities. When such information is analyzed over time, some patterns are likely to emerge. Given the current advancements in memory size, storage space and processor speed of mobile devices and also based on the above observations we propose a Mobile Information System that will provide the user with information about prominent attractions (restaurants, shopping malls, clubs, etc) in a selected geographic location. The system will also inform the user about the safety aspects in that specific locality based on the crime rate, incidences of theft and other such anomalies happening. The system will be accessible on mobile devices and will enable the users to input and maintain the information. Copyright © 2009 ACM.

AB  - Unlike in conventional networks, node positions in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) usually change over time. As a side effect of managing routes, routing protocols to some extent also disseminate neighborship and topology information in the network, thereby disclosing at least some information on a node's own position to other nodes. Due to the wireless nature of ad hoc networks, this information can become available even to third parties which are not participating in the network. Using this information, location profiling may become possible, where attackers gather information on node positions or mobility patterns. This information may then be used for anything ranging from targeted advertisement to criminal activities. Therefore, location privacy is an important issue in ad hoc networks. In this chapter, we first analyze to what extent an attacker can track the precise location of a node, assuming a powerful attacker model where an attacker knows all neighbor relationships plus information on node distances. We present a new approach which uses this information and uses geometric constraints and heuristics to find node positions efficiently. The quality of our results is discussed and compared to other approaches. In the second part of this chapter a more realistic scenario is analyzed where attackers try to abuse the DSR routing protocol, to obtain topology information and derive position estimations of other nodes from that. Therefore, we present a localization approach that is based on a "hop to route length ratio" heuristic and show how these results compare to our previous findings. As a result we conclude that the accuracy that can be gained by only using DSR protocol information is rather restricted and only poses a minimal privacy threat. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This article examines the settings for frauds in the context of crime networks, fraud opportunities and of a victim-centric typology of fraud. It demonstrates the variety of actors, settings and the variable need for knowing collaboration between co-offenders in frauds of different types. It explores what is known about those involved in the organization of some forms of frauds; how they find both co-offenders and victims in face-to-face and remote settings; and the barriers to growth of the 'fraud business'. It concludes that the globalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between settings, with their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns of business, consumer and investment activities), the variable abilities of would-be perpetrators to recognize and act on those opportunities (the 'crime scripts' perspective), and their interactions with controls (including, but not restricted to, law enforcement). Constructs of 'organized crime' are becoming less obsessed with the structure of groups than with what people need from the largely illicit and largely licit worlds before they commit fraud. Although some frauds are committed by generic transnational 'organized crime' networks, others are merely mobile small groups or individuals who can transplant techniques wherever they go; and others still commit very large one-off frauds without a need for long-term or any involvement in 'organized crime'. © 2008 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The technological capability of mobile devices in particular Smartphones makes their use of value to the criminal community as a data terminal in the facilitation of organised crime or terrorism. The effective targeting of these devices from criminal and security intelligence perspectives and subsequent detailed forensic examination of the targeted device will significantly enhance the evidence available to the law enforcement community. When phone devices are involved in crimes, forensic examiners require tools that allow the proper retrieval and prompt examination of information present on these devices. Smartphones that are compliant to Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) standards, will maintains their identity and user's personal information on Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). Beside SIM cards, substantial amount of information is stored on device's internal memory and external memory modules. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the currently available forensic software tools that are developed to carry out forensic investigation of mobile devices and point to current weaknesses within this process.

AB  - The advanced science and technology brings potential benefits to the police in investigating crime and also brings new opportunities for committing crime. The most likely advances in science and technology to impact on policing relates to the identification, authentication, and verification of persons. It also relates to the security applications, encryption, particularly the potential for criminal misuse, geo-location, lab-on-chip technology and third generation mobile phone technology. As these technologies advance, new patterns of crime will emerge and new opportunities for preventing, detecting and reporting crime will be developed.

AB  - Digital cameras are being integrated in a large number of mobile devices. These devices may be used to record illegal activities, or the recordings themselves may be illegal. Due to the tight integration of these mobile devices with the internet, these recordings may quickly find their way to internet video-sharing sites such as YouTube. In criminal casework it is advantageous to reliably establish the source of the video. Although this was shown to be doable for relatively high quality video, it is unknown how these systems perform for low quality transcoded videos. The CAMCOM2010 contest is organized to create a benchmark for source video identification, where the videos originate from YouTube. Despite the number of participants was satisfactory initially, only two participants submitted results, mostly due to a lack of time. Judging by the performance of the contestants, this is certainly not a trivial problem. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this article, we discuss the issue of methodological pluralism in qualitative research and in particular the case of Q methodology. Q methodology occupies an interesting position in arguments around methodological pluralism in that its location within qualitative (as well as quantitative) traditions has often been represented as a contestable issue. To contextualise our exploration of qualitative methodological pluralism, we will begin by presenting the theoretical questions we see as relevant to the mixing of Q method with other qualitative methods, including Q's own contested positioning within this grouping. This strand of our argument highlights continuities between some conceptualisations of the pattern analytics of Q methodology and discursive and thematic analysis. To ground this point, we present an empirical study that used both Q methodology and thematic analysis to address an issue in the community. More specifically, we will describe how Q methodology and thematic analysis were used to approach the evaluation of a programme to reduce recidivism amongst offenders and thus offer practical solutions in an applied setting. We will conclude by reflecting on the possibilities of pluralism when methodological boundaries are understood as mobile, and when stability of boundary construction is conceptualised as relationally produced rather than pre-existing. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Local opposition to day laborers is buik upon a standard diagnosis of the day labor "problem" and a common approach to its "remedy." The diagnosis views day labor as a public nuisance that imposes negative externalities on a locality by disrupting normal patterns of business, traffic, and pedestrian exchange. The remedy involves the enactment of new land use regulations, known as antisolicitation ordinances, designed to remove day laborers from the street comers-thereby undermining their ability to earn a living. Such ordinances regulate immigration indirectly by criminalizing conduct engaged in disproportionately by immigrant workers. Their proliferation, in turn, has invited a specific type of legal challenge focused on the deprivation of day laborers' First Amendment right to seek work. This Article examines a pivotal struggle in the national day labor movement: the two-decade long legal campaign to contest antisolicitation ordinances in the greater Los Angeles area. It asks whether and how litigation-often portrayed as a nemesis of social movements-has advanced the day laborers' cause. What it shows is that litigation has been an indispensMe social change tool in the fight for day laborers' rights, albeit one that carries inherent risk. On the positive side of the ledger, the Los Angeles day labor campaign has drawn upon strong legal capacity to mobilize a rights strategy, coordinated with grassroots organizing, against the backdrop of limited political options. It has thus avoided many of the familiar pitfalls of social change litigation in successfully challenging key ordinances. Yet, despite its success in preserving public space for day labor solicitation, the campaign's outcome rests in the hands of a federal appellate court, underscoring a fundamental social change reality: Even the most sophisticated litigation campaign ultimately hinges on the presence of sympathetic decisionmakers in the court of ultimate authority.

AB  - Three related measures of spatial movement (sequential angulation, spatial dispersion and consistency of distance in attack target) were compared across three serial offence types: serial homicide (n = 35), serial rape (n = 41) and serial burglary (n = 30). In each case, each offender had committed at least five offences. "Spatial dispersion", defined as the extent to which an offender distributes his offences across either a focused or relatively more evenly distributed area, revealed that burglary was less evenly distributed (i.e. more focused) than rape and murder. "Sequential angulation", defined as the degree of rotational movement around the home of the offender from one offence to the next, revealed that serial murderers have higher angulation scores than do rapists who, in turn, have higher angulation scores than burglars. Lastly, a comparison of the offender's consistency in the relative distance travelled from home to each attack site ("consistency of distance in attack target") was relatively similar across the three groups. This was despite the comparison of different serial offence types from disparate geographical areas. The supposition that differences in dispersion and sequential angulation scores across crime types are related to the perceived risk of the crime has been confirmed. The specificity and the mobility of the targets are also discussed. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

AB  - With the advent of new legislation in the United Kingdom - as well as several high-profile criminal cases - the issue of Internet grooming has been the subject of much recent focus. Of particular interest to the forensic examiner is the ability to trace back from a known suspect's computer system to identify contact with his alleged victims. Specifically, when an allegation of grooming is made, one of the first things the examiner should do is determine that the suspect's computer system was used to contact the informant's account in the first place. This a strong evidential link between victim and suspect and clearly demonstrates that the suspect was responsible for that contact rather than a third party who may have taken control of the suspect's chat account. This article illustrates some methods of proving such a link where the suspect and victim have been in contact on the Yahoo Messenger chat service. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to look into the trends of development of intellectual information systems and technologies as well as future possibilities of their implementation in the legal application domain. The question of how to integrate the different pieces of data available into a coherent framework for intelligence purposes has become an important topic. Increased mobility and new communication channels give criminals the capacity to better plan and organise their activities over large geographical areas. Patterns reflecting fraudulent activities are therefore, always more difficult to reveal from the huge quantity of data scattered in files across independent police and legal structures. The main tasks for development of advice, consultative information systems and the methods of implementation are being considered. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Although rational choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, there is a lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of "forensic awareness" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use. Methods: Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada. Results: Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness. Conclusion: Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In early 2001, Australia experienced a sudden, significant reduction in the availability of heroin, following a number of years of unprecedented availability of high-grade heroin. This study examines changes in the scale, method, structure and visibility of heroin and other drug distribution in New South Wales (NSW), and in the incidence of possession and use of heroin and other drugs associated with this reduction in heroin availability. Police incident data on possession/use of illicit drugs and on incidents of acquisitive crime were analysed using time-series analysis. Key informants (n= 71) from NSW law enforcement and health agencies and heroin users (n=53) were interviewed regarding changes in the drug market following the reduced availability of heroin. NSW police reports were accessed for information on police investigations into drug crime and related activities. Drug distribution in NSW appeared to change around the time of the heroin shortage. High-level distribution of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine may have remained somewhat discretely man-aged by different organized crime groups but greater collaboration occurred between these groups. Among mid-level distributors, there appeared to be a shift in emphasis from heroin to other drug distribution. Low-level dealers may have made a short-term shift from heroin to cocaine distribution. Low-level drug dealing also appeared to shift towards mobile and less overt methods of dealing. The number of street-level dealers reduced and in the longer-term, visibility of the drug markets decreased. There were significant decreases in police incidents of heroin possession/use reported by police, which were more marked among males and younger persons. At the same time, increases were observed in incidents for cocaine possession/use. There was a sustained decrease in theft offences but a temporary increase in robbery offences during the peak period of reduced availability. This appeared to represent a shift in the criminal behaviour of users remaining in the market and was associated with changes in drug-use patterns. Although the motivation behind the offending behaviour remained the same over time, cocaine use was associated with more violent crime. The method and structure of illicit drug distribution changed along with reduced heroin supply and carried implications for the policing of drug markets. Australia does not have a large cocaine market and the findings may have differed in countries where cocaine is in more ready supply.

AB  - In this paper we report on an investigation into the use of English in a prison in the Eastern Cape Province, run by the Department of Correctional Services (CS) five years after the declaration of an official multilingual policy. The investigation consisted of a range of interviews and observations in this institution, aimed at establishing the extent to which the national language policy is actually being implemented on the ground. Findings suggest that the use of English predominates in the high, official domains, that there is a marked avoidance of Afrikaans, and that Xhosa, the main language of the Eastern Cape Province, increasingly occupies the lower, unofficial domains. Tensions between policy and practice are discussed, and it is argued that the CS has shown that pragmatism is a much stronger force than ideology. While the roles of Xhosa and Afrikaans appear to be in the process of reversing in the Grahamstown prison, English has emerged as stronger there than it has ever been before. And because it will continue to be a necessary prerequisite for the mobility and promotion of staff in the country as a whole, and the lingua franca for an increasingly mobile criminal population (which means the prisons are likely to become increasingly linguistically diverse, rather than settling into regional patterns), everyone will have to have some proficiency in English, which, ironically, will promote and strengthen it even more. © 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The article looks into the ways certain mobile groups like the banjaras, gosains, fakirs and sanyasis were 'criminalised' by the colonial state between the periods of the 1760s and 1850s. Historiographically, the article argues for looking at the early colonial period more closely than has hitherto been done to understand the changing material and circulatory regimes in which these peripatetic groups operated. Unlike the current historiographical convention, which would explain crime as the artefact of a paranoid colonial mind-set, this article traces criminality to the disruption in prevailing patterns of trade and transport, and the livelihoods supported by them, consequent to colonial settlement and, in this region (eastern India), the rise of the kingdom of Nepal.

AB  - Studies on crime and mobility primarily focus on local crime patterns. The city has long played an important role, whether analysing the offence or the offender. This paper goes beyond city boundaries and discusses 'outbound offenders', whose crime trips start in a city, but end outside. It is argued that a substantial proportion of crime trips follow this pattern, indicating that areas other than cities also provide interesting opportunities for property crime. We link outbound offending to a number of features that may explain crime travelling, including the target's features and offender/offence features. We find that outbound offending mostly occurs towards affluent target regions and near motorways, as such confirming findings from previous research. We also find crime sprees to be indicative for mobile offending. Thus, mobile property offenders tend to compensate for travelled distances, not only by targeting affluent areas and using fast transportation means, but also by committing several successive offences, hereby reducing their relative transportation cost for each offence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Past research indicates that self-control relies on some sort of limited energy source. This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior. © 2007 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - The counterpart city represents an attempt to conceptualize the hidden spaces inhabited by social problems and 'problem' people who are counter to the mainstream, or included, modes of contemporary urban social life. This 'opposite', or negative, space comprises the spatially withdrawn and socially excluded who are largely outside the purview of the comfortable classes of the same cities. Not only has residential segregation been sustained over recent decades, so too have mobile circuits of mutual exclusion been created, which enable higher-income groups to avoid the associated negative externalities of poverty (visibility, disorder, aggression and so on). As responsibility for dealing with social risks has become devolved to the level of the household, the desire for social evasion, as politicians, media systems and welfare patterns mark out threatening territories, has become more evident. The counterpart city is shunned in ever more elaborate ways and with the support of public policies. As the 'spatial' social policies, housing and urban, have become increasingly criminalized in the focus of their agendas, such interventions expend energy to facilitate this separation between affluent and poor. Traditional imperatives for public intervention are diminished as poverty has become more concealed from affluence - its costs and impacts evaded by technologies, socio-spatial circuits and policies that skirt those who are locked into places of poverty and abject marginality, a constellation of social forces and effects I term the great cut. © 2008 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Brazil is one of the most violent countries in all of Latin America; indeed, it is one of the most violent countries in one of the most violent regions in the world. This is undoubtedly a key challenge for Brazilian development because it has a direct impact on economic and political life, contributes to the deterioration of and limits access to public health and education services, and greatly reduces employment opportunities for those living in high-risk areas. One of the most noxious effects of violence is that the climate of fear and distrust it generates limits people's freedom, restricting mobility in certain urban areas, rendering ineffective self and external policing mechanisms. And the effect on family life is devastating: violence has led to the breakdown of thousands of homes. This chapter looks at homicide in Brazil, using accumulated data covering large areas and population. Various studies have attempted to explain why rates of violent crime vary between cities, metropolitan areas, or states, and have correlated such variations with social, demographic, and economic variables.1 A study of homicide in the U.S., for instance, lists the following factors, starting with the most important: high economic disparities or inequality, population structures and density (the larger areas with the densest population have the highest homicide rates), and high unemployment rates.2 Various authors have tested the idea that socioeconomic inequality in specific areas, regions, and cities helps to explain the distribution of homicide rates in Brazil. They have pointed to the relevance of economic cycles,3 poverty,4 and income and other economic variables related to inequality or investment in public safety at the city level.5 The central role of firearms in violence in Brazil is alarming. According to international comparisons of firearm deaths undertaken by the World Health Organization, which take total population into account,6 out of twenty-two ranked countries Brazil comes second in the number of homicides caused by firearms and first in juvenile firearm deaths. International data indicate not only the extremely high level of lethal violence in Brazil (over 70 percent of homicides were committed with firearms, as compared with around 10 percent for the other countries in the group), but also the predominance of the use of firearms in the resolution of conflicts. Research and studies about the regional determinants of firearm deaths allow us to understand better the demand for and potential benefits of national and regional policies to control firearms and ammunition effectively, and to reduce legal and black market supply and demand. Thus, the aim of this chapter is to look at the incidence of homicides committed with firearms and to examine the extent to which regional variations can explain variations in the homicide rate. For the period 1980-2000, the relevant regional variations include cultural traits and patterns of conflict and control specific to each region. However, rather than using the "subcultures of violence" argument,7 the chapter looks at theories of social disorganization and control.8 One can analyze regions with historically high rates of firearm homicides in light of social disorganization resulting from land disputes where there are no formal con trol mechanisms. In such contexts, the resolution of conflicts through honor and traditional social behavior patterns replace formal and informal control mechanisms.9 Curiously, these patterns emerge also in metropolitan areas, particularly those dominated by armed groups that are fighting for territorial control of urban centers. Looking at rates of homicide is, then, a way of understanding the diversity of experiences in Brazil. We have yet to take into account the level of diversity of experiences within large urban centers. The phenomenon most closely associated with the rise of homicides in Brazil is urbanization. Strictly speaking, it can be said that, as in other countries, violent crime is an urban phenomenon associated with processes of disorganization and the deterioration of control mechanisms in Brazilian urban centers.10 There are various competing theories about the links between homicide and urban dynamics. One pioneering theory proposed by the Chicago School is the so-called social disorganization theory. It analyses different territories within cities and the association between social disorganization and violence, transition zones and criminality, and urban violence and youth.11 This disorganization was observed in some areas of cities in the U.S., where the absence or decadence of traditional values was a cause of moral and family crisis, which in turn led to criminality. Such territories became sui generis regions of sorts, in which social order was not clearly defined. Conflicts emerge, then, in deteriorated communities, characterized by constant changes in the population and intense mobility. In other words, these are areas lacking any kind of infrastructure. Together, these facts led to a transition process culminating in criminal activities by adolescent gangs. These gangs are part of the poverty belt of communities constituted by people who live in a socioeconomic "transition zone." The theory of social disorganization, for instance, assumes that delinquency is a group rather than an individual phenomenon, and that community social disorganization makes it hard to control youth groups. Another interpretation is proposed by strain theory, which assumes that deviance is the result of pressures caused by social structure. It is classified as a "systematic approach of social and cultural sources of a nonconformist behavior." 12 The emphasis that society places on cultural objectives can, and frequently is, much greater than the attention focused on means that the cultural targets recognize as socially valid. We have then a polarizing system, which varies the emphases on these two moments; balance would correspond to a situation in which the social satisfactions provided adjust to both pressures. Merton, for instance, argues that delinquency emerges when it is impossible to attain socially expected levels of consumption. The gap between aspirations, inflated in a consumer society, and achievements, limited by inequality and poverty, are the main explanation for crime. Subcultural13 and learning theories,14 on the other hand, argue that deviance and crime are social or cultural products that do not necessarily emerge as a result of disorganized social structures, but rather as a result of the division of society into different groups which pursue their own goals-goals that are set independently of the mainstream or dominant culture. Once the use of violence has been normatively indicated, the counter-norm will be nonviolence. The individual that belongs to a community where violence is the established means to resolve conflicts will be ostracized or treated with indifference if they do not use violence "appropriately. " This kind of social pressure foments adherence to subcultural values in which aggression is considered the usual means to deal with conflict. The hypothesis is that the open use of violence is part of a normative subcultural system which has ramifications on the individual psyche. Thus, the individual is forced to behave according to the norms of the social group to which they belong. Further, in addition to being socialized according to established standards, behavior is submitted to various types of control. On the one hand, the group makes a certain kind of behavior possible, promoting the acquisition of abilities, values, expectations, and objectives; and on the other hand, the group makes the individual behave in a suitable manner. Criminal or delinquent behavior is the result of belonging to a social group in both senses. In contrast with theories in which crime is seen as a consequence of poorly integrated or collapsed systems, in social control theory, crime is a consequence of failed mechanisms of social control, in turn the result of conjunctural crisis or imperative tendencies in modern society.15 Theories of social control emphasize the role of the family, school, religion, and other institutions in the prevention of crime in general and in juvenile delinquency in particular. Crime and delinquency are linked to the failure of the institutions responsible for the social control, so that researchers focus on incomplete families, the absence of parental orientation, or school truancy, among other such factors. These factors should be studied together with learning and socialization theories on the basis of the notion, crudely put, that "family, school, and church" teach citizenship, while "the streets" teach crime and delinquency. These theories are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, socioeconomic factors are a feature they all share. The empirical data used to confirm this hypothesis covers Brazil as a whole, five regions, twenty-six states and their respective capitals, and the Federal District. The population data used here is gathered from the official site of the Brazilian Health Ministry.16 Data on homicides are from the Health Ministry's Mortality Information System. These data cover the period between 1980 and 2002. The information is coded according to the International Disease Classification (IDC), Revision IX (for 1980-1995), and Revision X (for 1996-2002).

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. © 2009 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - America's continuing "war on drugs" has flooded the criminal justice system with substance abusers (Lipton, 1995; 1998). A 1997 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of incarcerated offenders found that 57% of state inmates and 45% of federal inmates reported drug use in the month prior to their offense. These rates are increases of 14% and 40%, respectively, over 1991 levels (Mumola, 1999). During the same period drug use among the general U.S. population was declining or holding steady (SAMHSA, 1998). Moreover, many of these drug using offenders are serious substance abusers, not casual users. Peters and his colleagues (1998), for example, reported that 56% of a sample of Texas inmates were diagnosed as having a substance abuse or dependence disorder during the 30 days prior to their incarceration. Similarly, a survey of jail inmates in Ohio found that 51% were currently drug dependent (Lo and Stephens, 2000). In all, a large body of accumulated evidence points to the substantial treatment need for a considerable proportion of offenders under criminal justice supervision (Belenko et al., 1998; Lo and Stephens, 2000). In fact, it is estimated that about 40% of all Americans who clearly need drug treatment are under the supervision of the criminal justice system (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990:7). Without effective substance abuse treatment, a high-proportion of these incarcerated offenders will resume their patterns of illicit drug use, and in all likelihood their patterns of criminal offending, once released from prison. As such, the period of time when an offender is incarcerated represents a crucial opportunity to prevent crime by intervening in this cycle of drug abuse and crime. Several aspects of correctional facilities (i.e., prisons, jails) make incarceration-based substance abuse treatment attractive. Perhaps most importantly, these facilities have the capacity to mobilize considerable coercive force to encourage substance abusing offenders to engage in treatment; many of whom otherwise would not do so. Additionally, the reduced availability of illicit substances facilitates detoxification and the isolated environments of many of these programs allow participants to focus on their substance abuse problems, in an environment typically more safe and clean than the environment in the general population. While the potential of incarceration-based drug treatment programs is clear, their effectiveness is much less so. Many evaluations of these programs have been conducted; however, methodological shortcomings prevalent in this body of research make it difficult to determine whether the observed effects are actually due to the program, or to methodological flaws in the evaluation. This chapter reviews this body of research utilizing meta-analytic techniques in an attempt to determine whether participation in these programs is associated with reduced drug use and other criminal behavior. More specifically, this systematic review focuses on addressing the following research questions: Are incarceration-based drug treatment programs effective in reducing recidivism and drug use? Approximately how effective are these programs? Is the estimated magnitude of a program?s effect associated with attributes of the research method, research sample, or intervention? Are there particular types of drug treatment that are especially effective or ineffective? © 2006 Springer.

AB  - Crime analysis uses past crime data to predict future crime locations and times. Typically this analysis relies on hot spot models that show clusters of criminal events based on past locations of these events. It does not consider the decision making processes of criminals as human initiated events susceptible to analysis using spatial choice models. This paper analyzes criminal incidents as spatial choice processes. Spatial choice analysis can be used to discover the distribution of people's behaviors in space and time. Two adjusted spatial choice models that include models of decision making processes are presented. The comparison results show that adjusted spatial choice models provide efficient and accurate predictions of future crime patterns and can be used as the basis for a law enforcement decision support system. This paper also extends spatial choice modeling to include the class of problems where the decision makers' preferences are derived indirectly through incident reports rather than directly through survey instruments.

AB  - Community notification laws have been passed by the federal government and legislature of every state. At the very least, these laws require local law enforcement officials to publicize the personal and residential information of known sex offenders. Although researchers and other social commentators have begun to assess the effects of community notification on targeted sex offenders and on criminal justice practices and practitioners, the potential consequences of the policy for different types of communities have received only scant attention. Using sex offender registry and US Census data for two states (Nebraska and Oklahoma), we examine the relationship between community characteristics and the residential patterns of sex offenders. Findings from mapping and regression analyses suggest a greater concentration of sex offenders in disadvantaged communities than in more affluent communities. To the extent that community notification allows residents of more affluent communities to mobilize resources in order to remove identified sex offenders, it may increase the geographical clustering of these offenders in areas already facing a greater risk and having fewer resources to manage the problem. Implications of findings in terms of "concentrated disadvantage" are discussed. © 2008 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - Environmental criminology focuses on the intersection in time and place of the offender and victim. Patterns of crime are generally explained in terms of the routine activities of the offender. His or her travel to crime distances are short and crimes are committed within the offender's ‘awareness space’. It has generally been theorised that victims also have short journeys to crime, associated with their routine behaviour. This review, however, suggests that occupancy of ‘unawareness space’, where people are away from familiar surroundings, may confer heightened risk. This is supported in research in the special case of crime and tourism, though other travelling victim patterns have been largely ignored. This paper postulates that crime risk increases at the intersection of offender awareness and victim unawareness spaces. The 2002–3 British Crime Survey provides some suggestive evidence on this. Its analysis reveals that 26.9% of self-reported victimisation occurs more than 15 minutes away from the victim's home. For personal theft crimes over 70% of the victims were outside their immediate locality, suggesting a stronger link between victim mobility and certain types of offence. This finding is discussed in light of the literature reviewed and some implications for crime prevention are considered. © 2007, A B Academic Publishers - Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - Social exclusion is not random, but concentrated in already marginalised groups and often related to the "frozen accidents" of particular forms of thinking about education and development that come to dominate policy and strategies for service provision. This paper examines how accessing the recently enacted right to education raises a range of justice concerns for mobile, and particularly transhumant pastoralist, children in India. It argues that provision of formal education reflects institutionalised patterns of economic discrimination and status inequality that deny such children what Nancy Fraser terms "participatory parity". The policy norm of habitation-based provision fails to fulfil the rights criteria of making schooling available and accessible, while the colonial criminalisation of mobility leaves an enduring legacy of discrimination. Formal education is complex and contradictory in relation to both moral dimensions of the human right and its contribution to social justice. © 2010 Educational Review.

AB  - A new mobile optical 3D measurement system using phase correlation based fringe projection technique will be presented. The sensor consist of a digital projection unit and two cameras in a stereo arrangement, whereby both are battery powered. The data transfer to a base station will be done via WLAN. This gives the possibility to use the system in complicate, remote measurement situations, which are typical in archaeology and architecture. In the measurement procedure the sensor will be hand-held by the user, illuminating the object with a sequence of less than 10 fringe patterns, within a time below 200 ms. This short sequence duration was achieved by a new approach, which combines the epipolar constraint with robust phase correlation utilizing a pre-calibrated sensor head, containing two cameras and a digital fringe projector. Furthermore, the system can be utilized to acquire the all around shape of objects by using the phasogrammetric approach with virtual land marks introduced by the authors1,2. This way no matching procedures or markers are necessary for the registration of multiple views, which makes the system very flexible in accomplishing different measurement tasks. The realized measurement field is approx. 100 mm up to 400 mm in diameter. The mobile character makes the measurement system useful for a wide range of applications in arts, architecture, archaeology and criminology, which will be shown in the paper.

AB  - Spatial analysis looks for statistically significant patterns in observed events that occur at specified locations. Most examples of spatial analysis consider aggregate characteristics over a number of coarsely defined regions rather than point processes. However, criminal events are point processes and should be modeled as such. In this paper, we combine recent advances in discrete choice theory and data mining to develop point process models for spatial analysis. We use this new methodology to analyze and predict the spatial behavior of criminals, and more generally, latent decision makers. The paper compares the performance of this methodology to more traditional hot spot methods of crime analysis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter presents an innovative agent-based model for crime simulation. The model is built on the integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. An AI algorithm (reinforcement learning) is applied in designing mobile agents that can find their ways on a street network. The multi-agent system is implemented as a Windows desktop program and then loosely coupled with ESRI ArcGIS. The model allows users to create artificial societies which consist of offender agents, target agents, and crime places for crime pattern simulation purposes. This is a theory-driven system, in which the processes that generate crime events are explicitly modeled. The simulated crime patterns are shown to have similar properties as seen in reported crime patterns.© 2008, IGI Global.

AB  - Criminal gangs, insurgent groups, and terror networks demonstrate observable preferences in selecting the sites where they commit their crimes. Accordingly, police departments, military organizations, and intelligence agencies seek to learn these preferences and identify locations with a high probability of experiencing the particular event of interest in the near future. Often, such agencies are keen not just to predict the spatial pattern of future events but even more importantly to conduct threat assessments of particular criminal gangs or insurgent groups. These threat assessments include identifying where each of the various groups presents the greatest threat to the community, what the most likely targets are for each criminal group, what makes one location more likely to experience an attack than another, and how to most efficiently allocate resources to address the specific threats to the community. Previous research has demonstrated that applying multivariate prediction models to relate features in an area to the occurrence of crimes offers an improvement in predictive performance over traditional methods of hot-spot analysis. This paper introduces the application of multilevel modeling to these multivariate spatial choice models, demonstrating that it is possible to significantly improve the predictive performance of the spatial choice models for individual groups and leverage that information to provide improved threat assessments of the criminal elements in a given geographic area. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - Despite the attention the crime of homicide has received by the academic community there are still gaps in the literature. One of these gaps pertains to the examination of the mobility patterns of homicide victims and offenders. This study addresses this gap by focusing on three research questions - (1) Does the distance traveled by homicide suspects and victims from their residence to the incident location vary by homicide motive type? (2) Does the reason why homicide victims and suspects travel to the incident location vary by homicide motive type? (3) What victim and suspect characteristics significantly predict the distance traveled from the residence to the incident location? The analyses show that there are statistically significant differences among the homicide types in terms of the length of the journey of victims and suspects to the incident location. In addition, there is variation by motive in terms of why the victims and suspects traveled to the incident location. Finally, the findings suggest that the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of victims and suspects have an impact on their journey to crime and victimization.

AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the impact of criminal mobility on criminal earning patterns in a sample of incarcerated offenders who reported their criminal experiences over a three-year period. Criminal mobility is indicated by an individual's offending perimeter and not the traditional journey-to-crime measure. Findings reveal that the offending perimeter length is a factor of criminal achievement in that mobile offenders reported higher financial earnings from crime than immobile offenders. Greater distances traveled for crime were also generally associated with higher criminal earnings, but this was more salient for predatory offenders than market offenders. © 2008 Sage Publications.

AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2006.

AB  - This paper describes several projects of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) that aim to produce mobile crime laboratories, among others, in an effort to speed up criminal investigations in the UK. Working closely with the Forensic Science Service (FSS), EPSRC hopes to shift the use of forensics from simply providing evidence for a prosecution towards actively helping during an investigation. One step was to introduce the Forensic Response Vehicle, a van fitted out with analysis equipment that can be driven to a crime scene. Equipment in the van can be used to take fingerprints, analyze DNA samples and download data from mobile phones. With this, scientists can turn around DNA samples much quicker than traditional procedures. A novel profiling technique is also under development at the University of Hull. Using a miniature chemical analyzer based on microfluidics, DNA fingerprint can, in principle, be generated in minutes.

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available." © SAGE Publications 2012.

AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. In addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements - the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention - to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a decline in the relative Black effect on violent crime in recent decades and interpret this decline as resulting from greater upward mobility among African Americans during the past several decades. However, other assessments of racial stratification in American society suggest at least as much durability as change in Black social mobility since the 1980s. Our goal is to assess how patterns of racial disparity in violent crime and incarceration have changed from 1980 to 2008. We argue that prior studies showing a shrinking Black share of violent crime might be in error because of reliance on White and Black national crime statistics that are confounded with Hispanic offenders, whose numbers have been increasing rapidly and whose violence rates are higher than that of Whites but lower than that of Blacks. Using 1980-2008 California and New York arrest data to adjust for this "Hispanic effect" in national Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data, we assess whether the observed national decline in racial disparities in violent crime is an artifact of the growth in Hispanic populations and offenders. Results suggest that little overall change has occurred in the Black share of violent offending in both UCR and NCVS estimates during the last 30 years. In addition, racial imbalances in arrest versus incarceration levels across the index violent crimes are both small and comparably sized across the study period. We conclude by discussing the consistency of these findings with trends in economic and social integration of Blacks in American society during the past 50 years. © 2011 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - We present a family of algorithms to uncover tribes-groups of individuals who share unusual sequences of affiliations. While much work inferring community structure describes large-scale trends, we instead search for small groups of tightly linked individuals who behave anomalously with respect to those trends. We apply the algorithms to a large temporal and relational data set consisting of millions of employment records from the National Association of Securities Dealers. The resulting tribes contain individuals at higher risk for fraud, are homogenous with respect to risk scores, and are geographically mobile, all at significant levels compared to random or to other sets of individuals who share affiliations. © 2007 ACM.

AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed. © 2011 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Geolocation information is not only crucial in conventional crime investigation, but also increasingly important for digital forensics as it allows for the logical fusion of digital evidence that is often fragmented across disparate mobile assets. This, in turn, often requires the reconstruction of mobility patterns. However, real-time surveillance is often difficult and costly to conduct, especially in criminal scenarios where such process needs to take place clandestinely. In this paper, we consider a vehicular tracking scenario and we propose an offline post hoc vehicular trace reconstruction mechanism that can accurately reconstruct vehicular mobility traces of a target entity by fusing the corresponding available visual and radio-frequency surveillance data. The algorithm provides a probabilistic treatment to the problem of incomplete data by means of Bayesian inference. In particular, we realize that it is very likely that a reconstructed route of a target entity will contain gaps (due to missing trace data), so we try to probabilistically fill these gaps. This allows law enforcement agents to conduct off-line tracking while characterizing the quality of available evidence. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A comparison of two referendum campaigns on Europe in France and Ireland shows two different patterns of mobilisation. Focusing on the perceived influence of the European treaties on national legislation on abortion, two different types of Euro-scepticism can be discerned. One is settled in a potentially universal project of ‘enlightenment’ (fearing the ‘criminalisation’ of abortion due to EU (European Union) regulations), the other is concerned with the defence of the nation's democratic sovereignty against the EU (and fears ‘liberalisation’ of abortion due to the same EU regulations). A discourse analysis of these two different settings establishes the ‘discursive dynamics’ of each campaign: How were actors constituted (into ‘legitimate’ actors) and how could the (differing) interpretations of EU treaty provisions become plausible and constitute into different national discourses? Instead of perceiving social variables (norms, rules, identities) as ‘independent’ factors that explain outcomes, the social process of their constitution is at the centre of this analysis. Understanding how and when certain actors and certain topics (or problematiques) come into being (are ‘constituted’) may, in turn, allow some ‘reasoned claims’ on the character of popular Euro-scepticism. © 2010, European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - This article reviews evidence from past research that addresses diverse themes and theories regarding shifts and patterns in the mobility of criminal groups. Our main objective is to identify push and pull factors that will help us understand how and why criminal groups, organisations or general organised crime patterns are present across a variety of settings (i.e. geographical locations, criminal markets and legitimate industries). Push factors refer to forces which drive criminal groups from a setting. Pull factors refer to forces which draw criminal groups to a setting. A distinction is also made between contexts in which offenders organise around available opportunities (the strategic context) and contexts in which opportunities induce greater organisational levels amongst offenders (the emergent context). The most general statement that can be formulated from the present exercise is that opportunities matter more than the group itself. What we demonstrate is that the problems concerning geographical locations, criminal markets and legitimate industries that are vulnerable to organised crime are persistent and stable over time. Groups that seize such opportunities, on the other hand, are transient and more than often short-lived. Aside from reviewing past research in search of such factors, we also apply the general understanding that emerges from our analysis to critically assess case studies that reflect popular images of organised crime threats in Canada during recent years. The concluding section identifies the key issues that must be addressed within this area. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study examines the crime patterns of New Zealand serial sexual I assaulters in order to determine the extent to which such offenders display spatial behaviour in line with their overseas counterparts. Hypotheses concerning journey to crime, criminal range and spatial pattern were tested. Geographical information on 76 serial offenders was extracted from police files and mapped. A series of spatial analyses were conducted in order to examine the spatial mobility of the offenders. It was found that, in line with much overseas research, offenders typically did not travel very far to offend (a median of 3 km) and operated over identifiable criminal ranges. However, in contrast to much overseas research into serial spatial patterns. New Zealand offenders were characterised by transience and commuting patterns of behaviour rather than a predominant marauder style. The implications of these findings for geographic profiling are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: Most researchers have found that property crimes have a local focus: offenders tend to operate in the vicinity of their residence. This has led the police to organise themselves to concentrate their resources in highly populated, urban areas. Over the last decade mobile property offenders have been found in various Western European countries that differ from this norm. These groups of mainly Eastern European multiple offenders engaging in property crime tend to travel further than other offenders. As such, their operations differ from most criminals, challenging the way the police are organised and undermining criminological theories on journey to crime. The aim of this paper is to look at the specificity of mobility patterns of these groups, to examine the precise interpretation of their mobility and to consider the implications. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the Belgian police database containing all serious property crimes in Belgium for the period 2002-2006. Some basic offender characteristics have been identified and for these offenders journey-to-crime patterns have been established. Findings: Eastern European multiple offending groups tend to commit their crimes in rural areas. Although they start their journey in regions considered "crime importing", they carry out their crimes in "crime exporting" areas. As such, they are atypical, challenging traditional theories on journey-to-crime and the way in which police forces are organised. Research limitations/implications: Observing a special group is one thing, but explaining these differences is another. Further research is needed, in particular with regard to the motivational aspects for these offenders. Originality/value: Whereas most researchers have found crime (including property crime) to be mainly local, the present research focuses on more mobile offenders. The challenges that these groups create for law enforcement authorities make it important for them and their patterns of activity to be understood. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Integration of new biological information (stable isotope analyses of archaeological human skeletons) with the archaeological sequence of southernmost Africa and with wider sociocultural studies of hunters and gatherers shows that between 4,500 and 2,000 BP coastal hunter-gatherers buried on the Robberg Peninsula and adjacent Plettenberg Bay ate large quantities of high-trophic-level marine protein. This contrasts with more mixed diets reflected in skeletons from Matjes River Rock Shelter, only 14 km along the shore. Assuming that the burials represent the populations that inhabited the sites, such clear economic separation could have come about only if these were two separate groups of people who lived in clearly demarcated, mutually exclusive territories. Such a settlement pattern directly contradicts ethnographic studies of southern African hunter-gatherers, all derived from inland areas. Later Stone Age material culture, including the assemblages from these sites, shows many similarities to that of twentieth-century Kalahari foragers, but settlement pattern and social organization were sometimes very different. © 2006 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

AB  - A newly devised lightweight sensor head, combining a digital LED projector and two cameras in a stereo arrangement with access to even complicated measurable object details, is presented. It uses a pre-calibrated, epipolar constrained, phase correlation based fringe projection approach. The mobile unit is battery powered and data transfer is done via WLAN to enable flexible use in complex measurement situations. Multi-view measurement is realized using the phasogrammetric approach with virtual landmarks. Thereby the system enables whole-body measurement without matching procedures or markers. The mobile character suggest application in arts, design, archaeology and criminology. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - When patient and therapist belong to two opposing ethnic groups that are engaged in war and terror, anonymity, neutrality, and indeed psychotherapy itself become almost impossible. Primitive transferences that involve suspicion and hostility are mobilized from the very beginning, and sadomasochistic power struggles threaten the therapeutic alliance at all times. Case vignettes from the treatment of three Palestinians by an Israeli analyst illustrate how developmental traumas may be reenacted in the relationship with an "enemy" therapist. From the therapist's perspective, this relationship may necessitate considerable technical flexibility, as well as a willingness and a capacity to tolerate and contain paranoid, hateful, and sometimes murderous feelings within the therapeutic dyad. From the patient's perspective, this involves the difficult task of trusting the enemy. It is virtually impossible to disentangle the personal from the political under conditions of national conflict, and their overlap may contribute to the development of extreme cultural attitudes to terrorism. Against this backdrop, the choice of an "enemy" therapist may reflect patterns of deeply ambivalent object relations, and may offer an opportunity to work through them as both parties oscillate between hate and hope.

AB  - Background: The term "stalking" describes persistent inappropriate threatening and often obsessive behaviour which is mostly intended to cause alarm and distress in the stalker's victim. Stalking represents a complex behavioural pattern, which includes harassment, the invasion of a person's privacy and often the use of violence. Methods: The present review assembles findings from 13 years of research. Results: In German-speaking regions the risk of being a victim of stalking during one's lifetime is 17% for women and 4% for men. The majority of offenders are men and the majority of victims are women. The prevalence of violent acts in stalking is found to be between 21 and 76% depending on the examined population and the definition of stalking and violence. The highest prevalence of violence is found in ex-partner stalking which presents the most dangerous form of stalking and is found to include some form of violence in 51-89% of cases. Other predictors of violent behaviour in stalking are verbal threats, especially if they are repeated. Also predictive of violence in stalking are personality disorders, especially if no major mental health disorder was present (such as schizophrenia or affective disorders). The prevalence of serious violence in stalking is probably underestimated because such cases are usually not registered as cases of stalking in police files. Studies of murder victims showed a high prevalence of stalking previous to the offence, which leads to the conclusion that stalking is a serious predictor of homicide. Predictors of serious violence in stalking are not the same as the ones of "average" violence in stalking. They also differ from the predictors usually employed in risk assessments. Predictors for serious violence in stalking are the length of stalking and having ambushed the victim at home. Different typologies are suggested which focus on such factors as type of relationship between stalker and victim, motive, psychopathology and risk profile of the stalker. Conclusion: Stalking represents a complex obsessive and persistent behavioural pattern which often aims at causing alarm and distress in the victim. New communication technologies such as mobile phones, text messaging and e-mails represent new and easier ways to stalk a person. Stalking happens frequently and results frequently in violent acts toward the victim. Especially ex-partner stalking includes more often than not some form of violence. However, there are currently no evidence-based recommendations on how to adequately assess the risk a stalker poses.

AB  - This article considers eighteenth-century urban credit and its relationship to social context and commerce from the perspective offered by two thousand private credit agreements preserved in complaints filed to initiate suits in the New York City Mayor's Court from the late seventeenth century to the eve of the American Revolution. The complaints cover the gamut of urban colonial commerce, from mundane local exchanges to ambitious and high-value ventures aimed at overseas markets. Some of the complaints run to as many as seventeen pages, but many are cast in formulaic terms over two or three manuscript sheets. The loss of most of the city's eighteenth-century tax records make it difficult to produce a comprehensive assessment of the litigants' social and economic status. But the patterns that do emerge from the aggregate glimpses of everyday practice give some sense of the city's distinctive credit market. Previous studies of neighbouring colonies have noted the increasing use of paper instruments and a shift to restrictive common law pleading in debt which, it is argued, provided creditors with greater commercial certainty and confidence and thereby nurtured the expansion of trade. However, in New York the complaints indicate that city traders retained a preference for dealing on account and presented their suits in the more flexible common law form of assumpsit, casting the city's economic and legal change in a different light. What we can glimpse of the practices and procedures associated with different forms of borrowing, indicate a local market that depended on inter-related household exchange and a commercial rationale that balanced considerations of profit with wider but cautiously-reckoned social obligations. For example, comparing the usual repayment terms available in the city with those offered wealthier borrowers, and the credit agreed between two upriver fur dealers and their Native American partners, reveals the city's credit market as a relatively conservative provider of support for residents and the able-bodied, thereby ensuring minimal public out-relief, which offered limited opportunities for investment and social mobility, even for those from within local circles. © 2012 by Koninklijke Brill N.V., Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Much hyperbole surrounds the political regime in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea). Many analysts argue that North Korea is a unique political system. What kind of regime is the DPRK, and what kind of leader does it have? A variety of labels are given to the North Korean regime. These include likening the regime to an organized crime family and to a corporatist organism. There are certainly merits to each of these approaches, but each has its limitations. Pyongyang does share some of the attributes of organized crime and certainly engages in criminal activity in a systematic and calculating manner. This pattern of illicit behavior includes the production and distribution of narcotics as well as the counterfeiting of foreign currencies, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. But the DPRK is more than a crime family-it possesses a massive conventional military force as well as significant strategic forces. Moreover, the regime continues to brainwash, imprison, or starve North Koreans, inflicting untold misery and death on its people. Corporatism, meanwhile, may provide insights into certain aspects of the system, but its utility is limited by the confusion that surrounds understanding of this concept. Certainly North Korea is distinct politically, but it also has significant commonalities with various regime types and authority structures. Pyongyang is a highly centralized and militarized bureaucratic regime organized around an all-powerful leader. This monograph examines the leader and the system, and identifies the regime type. The author contends that the North Korean political system is best conceived as a totalitarian regime that, although weakened, remains remarkably resilient. After analyzing the key elements of totalitarianism, he argues that the system's greatest test will probably come after the death of Kim Jong Il. While the totalitarian regime may not long survive Kim's passing, one cannot assume that the system will collapse. Rather, the end of totalitarianism may simply mean that the DPRK will enter a new "post-totalitarian" phase similar to the paths taken by other communist systems such as the Soviet Union and China. While the latter term may be a good fit to describe China's political system in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, it seems inaccurate to describe North Korea. North Korea has not undergone any process of "de- Kimification": Kim Il Sung remains a deity in 21st century North Korea and criticism or reappraisal is unthinkable. Moreover, no one has contemplated criticizing or challenging his legacy because, by all accounts, he remains universally revered by DPRK citizens, including defectors. Furthermore, any official reevaluation of Kim Il Sung is extremely unlikely because the regime is currently led by Kim's son. The most accurate way to characterize North Korea today is as an eroding totalitarian regime. While totalitarianism is a powerful and intimidating system, it places tremendous strain on a state and a society-demanding constant activity and mobilization of personnel and exploitation of resources. The costs of maintaining heightened ideological indoctrination, an ever-vigilant coercive apparatus, and a large national defense organization are high and ultimately debilitating. To maintain this for decades results in fatigue and burnout. Eventually leaders and followers reach a point where both are physically and mentally exhausted, and the country's infrastructure and resources become devastated. North Korea's elite and ordinary people appear to be approaching this point. But this fatigue and burnout does not appear to produce much in the way of protest or dissent, let alone revolt; most likely the majority of people in North Korea are simply too tired to do much more than focus their time and energy on providing for the basic needs of their families. An absolute dictator still rules the regime. While the regime continues to hold a monopoly of the instruments of coercion, there has been some slippage or erosion in the defining features of totalitarianism. First of all, Kim Jong Il, although he is virtually an absolute dictator, appears to take into account the opinions of others the way his father did not. And ideology no longer appears to be so focused on transforming the state and society and more on the instrumental goals of economic recovery, development, and firming up regime power. While a condition of terror remains palpable, it is no longer all pervasive, and individuals are able to navigate or circumvent the system without fearing that they face dire consequences. As a result of the shift in ideology and alleviation of the climate of terror, the regime has become "corrupted" literally as bribery is rampant, and figuratively as the regime seeks to preserve its power and status. Meanwhile, the Stalinist centrally planned economy has been seriously eroded, and the monopoly of mass communication has loosened significantly. The regime has attempted to repair the latter two elements, but it is not clear to what extent this will be successful. The regime appears to be stable and not on the brink of collapse. While it is difficult to speculate about the longevity of North Korea as a political entity, it is more manageable to forecast the future of totalitarianism in the DPRK. Totalitarian regimes rarely endure longer than several decades and almost never survive the passing of the absolute dictator. In fact, Pyongyang is unique in that it is the only totalitarian regime to weather a leadership transition (from Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il). Indeed, North Korea is the world's "longest lasting totalitarian regime, having spanned some 4 decades and surviving generational leadership succession." Perhaps none of the numerous challenges the regime faces is more daunting than the succession question. Kim has probably at most 10-15 years in which to pave the way for one of his offspring to succeed him. If he lives long enough, it is possible he could be successful. What is less likely is that totalitarianism could survive another leadership transition. At some point, the totalitarian regime will simply collapse or weaken to the extent that it becomes a posttotalitarianism system. Possibly the clearest indication of the status and fate of Pyongyang's totalitarian regime over the next 10 years or so will come in how the arrangements for the succession to Kim Jong Il are handled. Is there evidence that a particular individual is being groomed to succeed Kim? The answer appears to be "yes." Some other key indicators to monitor are signs of dissent among elites and masses, especially fissures that might occur within the party or military. By carefully charting trends, observers can make it less likely that they will be caught off guard by the actions of North Korea's leader or changes in its political system. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Fingerprints have always been the most practical and positive means of Identification. Offenders, being well aware of this, have been coming up with ways to escape identification by that means. Erasing left over fingerprints, using gloves, fingerprint forgery; are certain examples of methods tried by them, over the years. Failing to prevent themselves, they moved to an extent of mutilating their finger skin pattern, to remain unidentified. This article is based upon obliteration of finger ridge patterns .In this article, we propose a new classification algorithm GLCCM (Gray Level Correlation Coefficient Co-occurrence Matrix) algorithm for altered fingerprints classification. It is based on the fact that altered fingerprint image is composed of regular texture regions that can be successfully represents by co-occurrence matrix. So, we first extract the features based on certain characteristics and then we use these features for classifying altered fingerprints. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Local news programming from three television stations in Orlando, Florida was analyzed for racial and ethnic content in relation to crime. The data show that Blacks are not overrepresented among TV news suspects relative to their proportion in the population or among those arrested in Orlando. Hispanics are slightly overrepresented in relation to their numbers in the population. Qualitatively, Blacks and especially Hispanics who appear as crime suspects do so in more threatening contexts than Whites. Blacks are more likely to appear as criminal suspects than as victims or positive role models, but this pattern is especially amplified for Hispanics, These results suggest that local TV news may contribute to the social construction of threat in relation to Blacks and Hispanics, a condition that is associated with fear of crime, "modern racism," and the mobilization of various social controls and exclusions.

AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - While the ease at which capital crosses international borders has been well treated within the globalization literature, there has been relatively little discussion of the other main component of global economic activity-labor. Labor, in contrast to capital, is much more tied to places, it is highly differentiated according to place-specific histories, social experiences, cultural contexts, and such. Yet, labor, and people more generally, are moving globally in ever greater volumes. Some of these international migration patterns are long-standing, and precede globalization's ascendance in the last three decades.Others appear to be evolutionary, and derive their added complexity and unruliness from globalization's influences. Some others might even be regarded as direct consequences of globalization, or indirectly the result of social, economic and political upheavals and restructuring that has lead to this 'new age of migration'. One particular characteristic of this new-age, dynamic process is its 'unruliness', its unregulated, or difficult to regulate, nature, and its volatility and unpredictability. Another characteristic is its rapidly changing mix, with traditional distinctions between highly-skilled migration and lowskilled migration across borders becoming blurred as global mobility is accompanied by upward social mobility and increases in social, cultural and human capital stocks for many in both classes, such that middle-class increases are gathering pace.Attainment of the 'immigrant dream' is becoming more and more possible, despite the unruliness, the unpredictable and volatile times and the often desperate beginnings of the global journey. And, this chapter details this contemporary complexity, drawing distinctions between migration's unruliness that empowers people and brings positive returns and unruliness that endangers, disadvantages and often abuses and denies basic human rights to many of the millions involved in irregular flight. These latter 'unruly movers' seek the right to better livelihood opportunities by moving 'across borders', albeit without legal permission to enter or work in that 'other man's world'. Yet, anarchic unruliness at the borders, rising anti-immigrant national xenophobia, and unscrupulous migration facilitators-traffickers, smugglers, and criminal syndicates, and the like-only make their irregular world(s) more dangerous places and 'spaces'. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This paper is studied to develop a guideline of mobile phone design that protects a child from crimes. It is studied that the criminal commits crimes through the three steps of 1) approach, 2) attract, and 3) plunder - movement. Through this research, it was found that the child's recognition of the criminal situation could prevent the child from crimes. Because of limitations of child's cognition, this study is conducted to provide diverse solutions that could notify abnormal signs to the guardians using a mobile phone, even when the child has no awareness of the situation. In addition, the patterns of the child's usual route and walking speed are logged for detecting the criminal situation. This feature enables the guardians to intervene the crime. A design guideline for developing hardware and applications of a mobile phone is suggested through case analysis and expert interviews. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This study represents an effort to investigate the age pattern of criminal involvement from an economist's perspective. It presents a dynamic stochastic model of sequential search and match evaluation which is used to explain the reasons for, and the timing of, the decision to terminate a criminal career. The behavioral implications derived from the theoretical model are tested using individual National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Estimation results strongly support the prediction of a negative relation between the option value of retaining a criminal career and desistance decisions. More specifically, the effects of current and future expected criminal earnings are shown to be negative, substantial, and statistically significant in determining desistance probabilities. Retiring behavior is also significantly responsive to variables measuring personal costs of punishment and the availability and attractiveness of a legal income-generating activity in ways consistent with theoretical expectations. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - A mobile robot which behavior is controlled by a structured neural network and its learning algorithm are presented. The robot has 4 wheels and travels with 2 motors. Twelve sensors are used for detecting internal conditions and environmental changes. These sensor signals are input to the input layer of the network, and the network outputs motor control signals. The network model is divided into two sub-networks connected each other with short term memorys to process a series of behavior patterns. The robot can learn various habits by changing the patterns to be taught For one example, we made our robot playcops- and-robbers game. Through training, the robots learned habits such as capture and escape. © 1989 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present article examines the key concepts underlying victimization theories (i.e., exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, guardianship). Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization. © 1990, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

AB  - Factors in the organizational environment have been posited to be related to the development of employee alcohol problems and the identification of such problems. Previous research has yielded ambiguous findings on these relationships, but has indicated that some role is played. Data from a study of the experience of 2,083 Federal supervisors and managers with employees who had alcohol problems indicate that task interdependence and opportunities for mobility on the job are associated with greater probability of the identification of alcohol problems. The pattern of relationships indicates that peer influences may overshadow those of supervisors in the identification of employee drinking problems. Work characteristics were not related to the success of treating such problems and returning employees to the job. © 1981, Florida State University College of Criminology and Criminal Justice.

AB  - The annual prevalence of heroin use among a cross-section of black adolescents and young adults from Harlem fell from eight percent in 1970–71 to less than three and a half percent in 1975–76. The most important component of this change was a sharp decline in the rate of heroin initiation among younger birth cohorts. Controlling for differential opportunity based on age of cohorts, twenty-two percent of this sample who were born in 1952 initiated use of heroin by age 18, compared to three percent of those born in 1957. The explanation that appears most plausible for these findings is that, for most individuals, the actions of initiating and continuing heroin use appear to be a product of rational choice. And the context within which that choice was made was appreciably altered in this generation unit of Harlem youth. © 1980, Florida State University College of Criminology and Criminal Justice.

AB  - A total of 351 drug-users (127 in-patients of the university hospital for nervous diseases Frankfurt a. Main, 124 out-patients of the special health centre in the city of Frankfurt a. Main) were steadily investigated between the years 1969/70 with the aid of a fixed catalogue consisting of 386 single criterions with quantitative and qualitative alternatives. The informations for instance on the development of the drug-user, his familiar and social situation, sexuality, drug-use, vegetative nervous system, constitution were registered by widely pre-defined lists of data. The psychological investigation was done among other examinations by the modified Hamburg-Wechsler-intelligence-test. Subsequently the facts of the investigation were evaluated with the aid of an electronic computing station; the analysis of the data obtained took place by aspects of statistical correlations. Complementary to our study Hausner investigated in the same way 100 drug-users directly accosted at the so-called "scene". General characteristics of the drug-users: 80% were aged between 16 and 24 years (just under 25% till 16, 50% till 21, 25% above 25 years). There were each 20% female drug-users among the in- and out-patients, but 40% among the population of the "scene". Only 3% of all drug-users exclusively took cannabis, just under 50% in addition halluzinogenic drugs, some more than the half opiates too. All drug-users took stimulants, most often the opiate-users; in number: two thirds of the stimulants were taken by them. 60% were addicted or respectively suspected. According to the particular social level there was a special affinity to certain drugs (working people prefered stimulants, pupils and students cannabis and halluzinogenic drugs). University education of the father was dominating at the users of hallucinogenic drugs, half of them became addicted during the time of observation. Opiate-users more often had fathers without university education, they planned their profession more frequently not themselves and had more often a social decline. Social situations of the drug-users: 36% were pupils or students, 12% in vocational training, 8% professional active. 42% pursued no more any job. The so-called "drop-outs" more frequently had stopped going to school or stopped their professional course of education, they planned their profession more often not themselves and their future more seldom longtermed, pupils of secondary schools or students had only an average or even more modest intelligence-quotient. Overstrain and absence of suitable helps for the choice of profession seem to be important factors as to a disadvantageous progress of the drug-career. Only 50% of the drug-users visiting secondary schools or universities had the intelligence-quotient required. The drug-use seems to become encouraged by conflicts concerning high demands standards combined with actual overstrain. 43% of the drug-users had a social decline in comparison with their descent family. Hence follow level-specific endangering patterns to the development of addictions which primary are multidimensional applied. 49% of all drug-users investigated were likely to have a progressive course of their drug-career. This average-probability augmented to 68%, when the parents were left in conflicts, and declined to 40%, when there was a harmonic atmosphere in the parent's house. Only 1% of the drug-users was not impaired in their social connections after a drug-use of 6 months. The following factors were able to inhibit these social detractions: The factor retardation (including a corresponding reaction of the environment) and the factor constitution. Further on it appeared that the taking of drugs in community decreased to 50% in the last 6 months of the drug-use compared with more than 80% in the first half year of the drug-use. That means: The operation of drugs does not lead to the primary intended partner-ship but to a disappearing in the world of own experiences. 19% of the investigated people were criminal before starting the drug-use (special concerning prosperity delicts); after that 52% were criminal, special concerning violations of the narcotic law, 25% of them because of dealing with drugs. In general it is to say that there are to consider interactions for instance between negative social development and drug operation on the central nervous system when analysing the constellations of risks in direction of adverse progresses. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This preliminary report of findings pertaining to the "natural history" of narcotic addiction was based on a systematic random sample of males identified as narcotic abusers by the Baltimore City Police Department over a twenty year period (1952-71) and thus differs from other studies of addiction in that it represents a community-wide population of narcotic users. The sample was stratified by year of identification as well as by race and consisted of equal numbers of blacks and whites. Personal interviews with subjects were conducted using a structured questionnaire, and a special staff was used to locate and obtain permission to interview. Of the 349 persons in the sample, 343 were located, with a substantial proportion being out-of-state. Among the 343 located, 57 were dead, two were psychotic, six were not located, and 17 refused to be interviewed. Thus, 267 of the 290 potentially interviewable subjects were actually interviewed, which represents an interview response rate of 92% The mean age for the entire interviewed sample at time of first identification was 24.4 years, with the comparable figure for blacks being 1.8 years higher than that for whites. The mean time-interval for police identification of respondents as narcotic users after the beginning of regular use was nearly five years, but the variation surrounding this figure was high. In particular, the figure was higher for blacks than for whites, with no consistent trend over time shown for either race. The year of first regular narcotic use for the interviewed sample ranged from 1910 to 197 1. Mean age at first regular narcotics use was 20.1 years overall, with very little difference between whites and blacks in this respect. Approximately one-fourth of those interviewed were currently using narcotics, about one-fifth were in treatment, and the remainder (56.9% reported themselves as not using narcotic drugs at the time It is emphasized that this paper represents only a preliminary step in the analysis and presentation of data obtained in a three-hour comprehensive interview. Future papers will examine individual and group trends since first regular use of narcotics with respect to drug taking, living arrangements, work, criminal activity, drug selling, other sources of income, and pattern of daily activities. © 1975 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The literature on the association of social class and adolescent drug use reveals generally that children of the well educated and affluent are at an increased risk for drug abuse. This is probably most true for non-opiate drugs. This is an unsettled question in present studies, with the position taken in this paper that adolescent drug use is a multi-determined phenomenon with socioeconomic status being one important variable, especially with children of the wealthy or famous. Special developmental issues in these children can make them ultra vulnerable to drug abuse, especially parental absence or deprivation, lack of inculcation of intact self-esteem or frustration tolerance and especially lack of goal-orientation. “Neuroses of mobility” or rapid changes of family status are related to adolescent drug use vulnerability as well as “old money” family patterns leading to increased risk for adolescents. Case examples and special therapeutic considerations for this population are discussed. © 1984, Florida State University College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. All rights reserved.

AB  - One hundred nineteen smear-positive leprosy cases registered at an urban leprosy centre in Bombay in 1991 were followed for three years to study the 'drop-out' pattern in them and judge the utility of some corrective measures for the same. The measures included having maps showing exact location of the patient's residence, paying home visits on registration days and subsequent persuasion and counselling both at the clinic and at the residence of patients. The results were compared with 'drop-out' in smear-positive cases registered at the same centre in 1989, 1990, 1992 and 1993. By introduction of the special measures, the 'drop-out' rate was significantly reduced from 52% (for other years) to 36% (1991). The expenses incurred for the successful recovery of 'drop-out prone' patients and ensuring regularity in drug intake was Rs. 659/- per patient. This study of 'drop-out' patient shows that there are three categories of the so-called drop-outs: (i) the false 'drop-outs' (51%): these patients get transfer as per their convenience to other leprosy centres or medical services (private practitioners or consultants) within the city (ii) drop-outs due to migration: the migration is forced on them due to some genuine reason, and (iii) persistent offenders: this is a group of adamant, non co-operative, or, distressed patients. For the first two categories of patients it is advisable to introduce a good referral system. For the recalcitrant defaulters, supervised short-term drug therapy will probably be the best option.

AB  - The accommodations of criminal justice personnel to changes in organizational structure is an unresearched phenomenon. Drawing upon qualitative data, I present a historical accounting of how probation officers responded to the bureaucratization of their department. Patterns of accommodation resembled those described by Presthus as (1) upwardly mobile, (2) indifferent, and (3) ambivalent. An analysis of these patterns helps provide an understanding of organizational dynamics prevailing in contemporary agencies. Those officers most suited to a bureaucratic setting dominate today's probation practice. © 1987, SAGE PUBLICATIONS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forms of youth organisation and culture which emerged amongst African migrants in towns during the first decades of the century remain obscure. Based on oral and archival sources, this article attempts to disaggregate, periodise and construct an understanding of those forms of cultural organisation which came to be known as amalaita. In Durban the amalaita emerged in the wake of the massive social dislocation experienced by African societies in Natal and Zululand in the late nineteenth century. It is argued that they were first and foremost migrant youth organisations whose members adapted a repertoire of Zulu rural cultural practices and forms of self-organisation to cope with new conditions of life in town. This is an interpretation supported by oral testimonies although even within popular memory itself the meaning of the term is sometimes extended to include relatively discrete forms of adult migrant and even criminal association, for reasons which the article explains.Although the amalaita cannot be described as ‘political' in any advanced sense, their organisation and consciousness could, at times, provide the basis for more concerted challenges to local political authority. While the cultural idioms of Zulu youth were absorbed into a local popular political culture after 1925, there is also evidence to suggest the mobilisation of certain youth gangs by ICU activists. It is also argued that official attempts to de-politicise popular cultural expression together with qualitative changes in police control and the rapid social transformation of local society, had, by the late Thirties, begun to re-mould patterns of migrant youth association in Durban. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of a mixed integer programming type model designed to determine the best transport mode and rail network location strategy for a leading international automobile manufacturer to supply its North American dealers. In particular, this manufacturer wished to establish a plan for its future vehicle distribution that would determine the best mix of truck, conventional rail and containerized intermodal rail to transport cars and light trucks from its North American plants and ports of entry to its dealers. Further, the manufacturer desired to evaluate the proper number, types and locations of rail terminals required for its distribution network. This paper is intended to provide a perspective on the practical application side of this study and how one can conduct such studies in a condensed time period. Thus, in addition to describing the study problem, results and benefits, we also emphasize such topics as how one can manipulate relatively "user friendly" commercial software to address potentially complex mode choice and location problems. © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper summarizes the comprehensive reservoir characterization effort for the foam pilot area and discusses the response to foam injection in the CO2 Foam Field Verification pilot Test conducted in the East Vacuum Grayburg San Andres Unit (EVGSAU) in New Mexico. A detailed study of the pilot pattern geology provided an understanding of the major controls on fluid flow in the foam pattern. Pattern performance data, falloff testing, profile surveys, and interwell tracer results were integrated into the geologic model to guide project design work and provide a framework for interpretation of foam performance. Localized regions of high permeability resulting from solution enhancement of the matrix pore system appear to be the primary cause of the early CO2 breakthrough and channeling of injected CO2 toward the problem production well in the foam pattern. Positive response to foam injection is indicated by reduced injectivity and injection profile data in the foam injection well; by results from time sequence monitor logging in the observation well; and by changes in production performance in the high GOR, 'offending' production well in the foam pattern. Hall plots and pressure falloff testing were used to measure in situ changes in fluid mobility near the foam injection well. Time sequence logging responses at an observation well located 150 feet from the foam injector provided evidence of changes in fluid flow patterns in response to foam injection. Positive response to foam injection is further evidenced by changes in the CO2 production and oil rate performance at the 'offending' production well in the foam pilot pattern.

AB  - A mobile robot with behavior controlled by a neural network and its learning method are presented. The robot has four wheels and travels with two motors; it has twelve sensors for detecting internal conditions and changes in environment. These sensor signals are fed into the input layer of the network, and the network outputs motor control commands. The network model is divided into two subnetworks connected to each other with a short-term memory to process time-dependent data. The robot can learn various habits by changing the patterns to be taught. One example, the habits to play a cops-and-robbers game, was taught. Through training, the robots learned habits such as capture and escape.

AB  - Ten personality factors were derived from an extensive psychological test battery administered to 201 patients on criminal wards at a mental hospital. Factors were identified as anxiety (U.I. 24), assertiveness (U.I. 16), self-assuredness (U.I. 28), realism (U.I. 25), mobilization (U.I. 23), stolidness (U.I. 30), objectivity (U.I. 20), inhibition (U.I. 17), and passiveness (U.I. 18). Cluster analysis grouped patients into four categories: (i) 'primary/secondary' and (ii) 'subcultural' psychopaths, both low on inhibition; and (iii) 'overcontrolled' and (iv) 'violent aggressive' groups, both high on inhibition. Primary psychopaths and overcontrolled patients were higher on realism, mobilization, and objectivity. Different patterns of age, sex, intelligence, personality and criminal records supported the interpretation of these clusters. Low inhibition (along with assertiveness and mobilization) was associated with 'crimes without deterrents' and high inhibition (along with stolidness, low mobilization, and low realism) with 'crimes of passion'. Discriminant analyses for crimes correctly classified about 65% of patients, but for more infrequent crimes, there were twice as many false positives as actual offenders. In one, two and three year follow-ups, recidivists showed more stolidness (U.I. 30) and more subcultural conformity (U.I. 20-). Violent recidivists were less expressive (U.I. 28) than other groups. From the WAIS, neuropsychological tests, and neurological diagnoses, the suggestion is made that frontal-temporal impairments show decrements in assertiveness and realism, while more diffuse impairments would affect mobilization. High rather than low inhibition was more likely to be associated with impairment, typically lateralized to the right hemisphere. © 1980.

AB  - Much individual-level research in criminology is based on deterministic: models of street-crime and suite-crime. Factors that constrain individuals to crime or conformity are predominant. This paper explores the advantages of a more soft determinism in explaining crime; especially intimate violence. Routine activities theory, which assumes freedom of action and rational choice, is used here to analyze patterns of intimate violence, especially, child sexual abuse. Marcus Felson's model of predatory crime provides a unique interpretation of intimate violence. Criminal incidents involve the physical convergence of three elements: a motivated offender; a suitable target; and the absence of a capable guardian. The convergence of these factors in intimate violence is analyzed; the potential of routine activity theory in explaining domestic abuse is assessed. Finally, suggestions for crime control in intimate violence based on routine activities theory are presented.

AB  - This article describes and analyzes ten Negro short-con men who were part of a larger sample of 400 offenders interviewed and tested at the District of Columbia Reformatory (actually a penitentiary), at Lorton, Va. It was hypothesized that offenders with a confidence-game criminal pattern would constitute a cer tain social and psychological type different from that of offenders with other criminal patterns. Comparisons demonstrated this to be the case. The con men under study were all characterized by the facts that they were isolated, marginal, hedonistic, mobile, exploitative, nonviolent, undisciplined, unsuccessful, recidivistic, institutionalized, sociopathic offenders. All had domineering mothers who taught them, at an early age, the necessity for, and the practice and reward of, deceit. This early training in deceit and nonviolence shaped the type of criminal pattern they chose in later years. They rarely committed offenses that were not related to confidence games. Although they learned their “trade” from the big con, they lacked the finesse, skill, and in dustry necessary to become successful in their criminal career. They rationalized away their brand of crime as really not crimi nal and condemned many other types of crime. They derived pleasure, as well as financial reward, from “putting the mark down.” © 1964, Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT). All rights reserved.

AB  - Seventy-one criminals with long arrest histories that revealed no pattern or concentration on a specific variety of crime were compared with the remainder of a total sample of 400 criminals, nearly all of whom did show a pattern in their criminal activities. The writers hypothesized that a comparison of the no-pattern group with the remainder of the offenders would reveal differ ences that would show why these 71 criminals did not evince any particular pattern. They also hypothesized that the no-pattern group might consist of two subgroups—one bright and highly mobile (in terms of shifts toward more “advanced” types of crime), and a second so dull that more experienced criminals would not accept them as apprentices. However, bright, mobile offen ders were almost nonexistent in the no-pattern group, indicating that criminal progression of adult criminals takes place within, not between, specific types of crime. While intellectually dull, the no-pattern group was no more so than the whole sample, so that lack of intellectual ability does not seem to be the cause of their lack of pattern. The introverted, “marginal” character of their personal relations suggests that these offenders showed no pattern because they did not have close enough contact with other criminals to learn effective techniques. Because of their naïveté in criminal operations and consequently their frequent incarceration, they were shunned by other criminals. Thus, they were further limited in their opportunities to learn a single, “sophisticated” pattern of crime. © 1962, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The opening part of the article, which sets up a broad framework for comparing the industrial and justice agencies, is followed by a more detailed discussion of the post-war criminal justice system. The article then looks at Stalin's 1947 campaign against theft. As in earlier campaigns, legal officials and criminal sanctions were mobilised in a merciless struggle against those who threatened Stalin's economic policies. As on earlier occasions the 1947 offensive also drew on Stalin's personal authority and was supported by a nationwide media blitz and by an emergency communications system which involved the use of telegrams and 'special lists'. As such the 1947 war on theft will be regarded as a form of 'campaign justice'. The article goes on to show that by 1947 rules and incentives acted as a brake on 'campaign justice'. By comparison with campaign justice in the 1930s the criminal justice agencies were relatively constrained. Notwithstanding the strong terms in which this campaign was couched, the article shows how, in an analogue to the social and moral conservatism that had set in elsewhere in Soviet life, the internal world of the justice bureaucracies had by this time become comparatively rigid and governed by a relatively uniform and conservative set of social values. While being more constrained, the question of whether the pattern of rewards and penalties in the command economy and in the criminal justice system was sufficient to foil the ambitions of the political leadership, as the Dunmore thesis would imply, is a more complex issue, and is dealt with at the end of the article.

AB  - [Editor's Note] This article is highly theoretical, involving the development of social and legal concepts, yet it is highly recommended for all who are engaged in criminal justice, since it discusses how social change, particularly the rate of change, affects human behavior. Social change here is defined in terms of changes in basic societal institutions, such as family, religion and education. Individuals maturing in society internalize institutional patterns and learn to live by them. The key factor in the interaction of groups according to institutional patterns is the establishment ofbasic norms of conduct. Criminal behavior is defined as deviation from these norms. Possibly the most urgent question facing all societies today is how to maintain a reasonable equilibrium in the face of accelerated social change so that the benefits of this change are not offset by a concomitant increase in crime. When societal institutions change, the character of the control that institutions exert on norms of conduct also change. One important observation the author makes in this respect is that all societies seem to move from tight institutional integration to social disintegration where institutions no longer interlock or re-enforce each other. This is particularly evident in regard to the influence of the family, religion and education upon young people, and has led to what is popularly termed a more “permissive” society where there is a great deal less restriction on an individual's social, physical and intellectual mobility. As the author indicates, social changes of this sort are a “mixed bag”. On the one hand it has resulted in an enormous increase in economic wealth, material well-being and educational enbghtenment, while on the other it has left individuals without adequate ethical frames of reference, producing an increase in criminal behavior. Central to this overall problem is the relationship ofthe law, since it is ditlicult to define human behavior with the specificity demanded by the law. Two features of the law are relevant to any consideration of criminality in the context of social change: its durability and its tendency to expand. Laws usually remain long after customs pertaining to them have fallen into disuse, and social change introduces new concepts ofwhat is permissible and what is not, but the law is often slow to adopt these new concepts. In addition, as modem society becomes more complex, the mere quantity of laws tends to multiply to a bewildering degree to the extent where the honest citizen can unknowingly commit any number of offenses unknown to preceding generations. One example is the effect industrialization has had to produce a welter of new areas of crime, such as traffic offenses, organized crime and white collar crime together with a blurring of the distinction of what constitutes criminal acts and shrewd business practices. Closely connected with this is the highly technical problem of judicial flexibility versus judicial restraint. The author feels nevertheless that if social change in handled wisely crime might even diminish. A number of suggestions are presented to deal with these perplexing questions. Perhaps a greater distinction would be made between criminal and non-criminal acts. In addition, there could be a greater individualization of justice when a violation of a criminal law was unintentional. There are also a number of important questions in regard to the law. Is the law the best teacher, or is it too formalized and ought a greater reliance be placed on education? If the law doesn’t grow or change, is the solution simply to expand the enforcing area? If goals are to be set for the most unstable societal element, namely the youth culture, what is the nature of these goals? Finally, it is obvious that the minimizing of crime requires careful planning, but planning to achieve positive social and economic results.

AB  - This paper focuses on the mobility of one specific group of the UK population: those people who were charged with a crime and detained in prison in the late 19th century. Police records for the Cumbrian (Westmorland) town of Kendal not only give details of the charges made in Kendal, but also list a large number of previous and subsequent offences including the place where the charge was made. Those who had no fixed address were often skilled and middle-aged, committed relatively minor offences but were quite harshly treated by the law. It seems likely that their high re-offence rate reflects the attitude of police to trampers rather than their predisposition to crime. Although those with no fixed address were more mobile than those with a fixed address, the pattern of their mobility was not atypical. 45.1% of those without a fixed address had moved only 31 miles (50 km) or less before re-offending and there is no significant difference in the length of time between the end of their sentence and another charge for the two groups. Those charged with crimes in Kendal rarely moved outside northern or midland England and most moved over relatively short distances within territory with which they were probably familiar. -from Author

AB  - Crime is increasingly recognized as a problem by persons responsible for facility site selection and premises security. Environmental criminology can contribute to crime prevention through analyses of spatial patterns in crime, perceptions and awareness spaces of potential criminals, criminal mobility patterns, and the processes of target selection and decision to commit a criminal act. Rational choice theory is utilized to illustrate the decisionmaking process employed by many criminals. Although physical target-hardening measures are relevant to environmental criminology, the social interaction dimension among criminals, victims, bystanders, and certain aspects of the environment are central. Levels of security necessary for a given location may be established through consideration of the probability of attack at a given location, the vulnerability of this location to such an attack, and the critically or importance of any resultant loss to the continuing viability of the organization. © 1990.

AB  - This article applies the theory of individual rational choice to micro data on the criminal activity of juveniles. The individual choice model is developed and applied to data on 1,171 files on property offenses adjudicated by the Family Court between 1972 and 1976. It is found that the type of crime chosen, as indicated by the charge at the time of arrest and the final charge, is influenced by sex, age, number of prior referrals to the court, ethnic extraction, and place of residence of the juvenile. As the effect of each of these individual characteristics on the probability of selecting the various crimes differs, the choice of crime exhibits dynamic features; as the individual age increases, and as the number of prior referrals to court increases, the probabilities of selecting particular crimes change. These features are examined by generating the probabilities and examining the patterns which emerge. © 1982.

AB  - Changes in the treatment of criminals usually have required increases in size and changes in training of treatment staffs. The pattern currently emerging, pioneered in the care of the mentally ill, involves less exclusive reliance on highly trained treatment specialists and more infusion of treatment concerns and skills in line staff. Also, the boundary between institution and community treatment is becoming obscured because of new transitional pro cedures and facilities. Strains develop with these changes because of inmate and staff comfort in fixed statuses, defects in much new treatment, inadequate research to evaluate treatment, and failure to recog nize that optimum treatment varies with the type of offender. The changes also create severe manpower problems. Shortages in re search personnel can be met by new recruitment strategies and by procedures which combine operations and research records, thus improving both. The primary need, however, is in recruit ment and training of line personnel who are committed to cor rectional careers and oriented to correctional change. The Cor rectional Rehabilitation Study Act of 1965 mobilizes educational and professional organizations for coordinated effort to meet these needs. © 1966, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - A mobile robot whose behavior is controlled by a structured hierarchical neural network and its learning algorithm is presented. The robot has four wheels and moves about freely with two motors. Twelve sensors are used to monitor internal conditions and environmental changes. These sensor signals are presented to the input layer of the network, and the output is used as motor control signals. The network model is divided into two subnetworks connected to each other by short-term memory units used to process time-dependent data. A robot can be taught behaviors by changing the patterns presented to it. For example, a group of robots were taught to play a cops-and-robbers game. Through training, the robots learned behaviors such as capture and escape. © 1990 IEEE

AB  - Considerable attention has been directed to the incidence and distribution of crack in urban areas. In response to public concern about the presence of crack in residential neighborhoods, law enforcement agencies have implemented various law enforcement strategies aimed at reducing or eradicating drugs from urban environments. These strategies, however, have failed to consider crack users' mobility patterns. Because any effort to reduce crack consumption and distribution should consider these patterns, this research assesses the journey to purchase crack and suggests some areas of future research. Initially the research determines how far crack users travel to purchase drugs and considers whether crack users who travel less than.5 mile on average differ significantly from those who travel more than.5 mile. This study examines whether this difference is due to individuals’ socioeconomic factors to characteristics associated with the drug-buying event. Discriminant analysis shows that crack users travel varying distances to purchase the drug. In explaining these differences, gender is an important lifestyle indicator, and the tendency to “cop” in the user's residential neighborhood is a major event characteristic. Characteristics associated with the crack-buying event are generally more important than individual characteristics in explaining the distances traveled. © 1995 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.
