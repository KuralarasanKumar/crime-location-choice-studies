AB  - Objectives: We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urbancontext by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations andpresence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods: The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results: The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closerto their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offendinglocations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors andgenerators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions: By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime locationchoice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discusslimitations and make suggestions for future investigations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that “taste” preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between land use, walkability, and the outcomes of neighborhood crime rates of larceny and aggravated assault. We use a combination of OLS regression models, harmonic analysis of diurnal patterns, and geospatial statistical techniques to examine the spatial patterning of larceny and aggravated assault in 782 Census blocks in Miami-Dade County, Florida with long-term data from 2007 to 2015. The results show that neighborhoods (i.e., Census block clusters) with higher levels of walkability have greater levels of aggravated assault. We also find that the increasing land-use diversity increases both aggravated assault and larceny. Finally, aggravated assault peaks during late night hours, while larceny peaks during daytime hours. Based on the results of our study using conventional and geospatial analyses, routine activity and social disorganization theories of neighborhood crime are partially supported, in that more motivated offenders and potential targets increase crime rates, while increased guardianship and informal social control reduce crime rates. The results of this study have important implications for security experts, law-enforcement agencies, and urban planning policy specialists focused on reducing crime in metropolitan areas. It is also relevant for theoretical frameworks designed to explain and predict temporal and spatial crime patterning. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper investigated the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations on the spatial distribution of commercial burglary in San Francisco. Method: Geocoded commercial burglary data for 2003–2021 from San Francisco were analyzed using the Andresen Spatial Point Pattern Test to examine potential spatial movement in commercial burglary. Results: Concentrations of commercial burglary spatially shifted following the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent stay-at-home orders. Original hot spots experienced a relative decrease in commercial burglary, and crime spread out throughout the city. These spatial changes in commercial burglary appear to be related to variations in guardianship and criminal opportunity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the dramatic shifts in routine activities resulting from the COVID-19 policies could disrupt spatial burglary patterns, especially burglary clustering. Law enforcement should consider the spatial dynamics of commercial burglary, as well as land use heterogeneity, to effectively respond to crime during periods of social distancing and business shutdowns. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022. corrected publication 2022.

AB  - Several researchers have linked the configuration of public places to the risk of sexual attack against women, including rape. Based on the routine activity approach and crime pattern theory, we expect to find the greatest risk of outdoor urban rape near public places that are “target rich,” “offender rich,” and “guardian poor.” We apply the theory to 193 outdoor rape locations in Campinas, Brazil, 2010–2013. We measure distances to the nearest bus stops, bars, and residences, then compare each of these to the distance from random points in the same city. Consistent with theory, outdoor rape victimizations occur disproportionately near bus stops and bars, but at least 250 meters away from the location of the nearest residence of any type. This baseline model suggests that urban planners could make women more secure from outdoor sexual attack by improving the design and location of public places, reducing the concealment of such places, and enhancing guardianship. © Copyright 2021 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.

AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders’ previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders’ knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location’s crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This is an account of the personal origins of closely related crime theories that the authors have helped develop: the routine activity approach—Marcus Fel-son (MF) and situational crime prevention—Ronald Clarke (RC). Criminologists generally pay too little attention to the actual commission of crime, and tend to assume that it is over in a flash. This chapter de-emphasizes variations in generalized crime motivations among individuals, or differences between offenders and larger humanity. In the case of capital punishment, severe punishment also carries the risks of serious discrimination and miscarriages of justice. In the case of the routine activity approach and the rational choice perspective, a positive result would serve only to reaffirm the patently obvious, while a negative result would mean that either the dependent or the independent variables were misspecified. Hundreds of other sociological criminologists were produced, hardly any of whom felt it necessary to abandon the paradigm they were taught and who developed anything like the routine activity approach. © 2011 by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Students buying custom-written assignments and submitting these as their own or contract cheating is a particularly serious form of academic misconduct. However, compared with other forms of plagiarism and cheating, comparatively few students engage in contract cheating. This chapter discusses two main perspectives that may explain why students do not engage in contract cheating: criminological theories, and the role of psychological individual differences. The authors present a modified routine activity theory of crime, which suggests that barriers to contract cheating will make it a low-frequency event to begin with, and that strengthening those barriers may reduce its incidence further. In addition, the rational choice theory of crime proposes that peoples reasons for engaging in crime-like behaviours are important. The authors outline the findings of their research on the reasons why students do not engage in contract cheating, including how individual differences in students psychological profiles are related to their reasons for not cheating. Compared with research that seeks to explain why students cheat, research examining why students do not cheat is scant. Thus, this chapter concludes by pointing to some of the many possible directions for future research on this topic. © Tracey Bretag 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - This volume’s contention that regulations have a powerful role in crime control contradicts the prevailing positivism of criminology—that is, the contention that criminality is largely explained by criminals’ past experiences. This article draws upon recent critiques of positivism and explains the implications for contemporary criminology. It begins by describing the ideas of a London magistrate, Patrick Colquhoun, about the determinants of crime and the best means of its control. Colquhoun’s writings were the first developed discussion of regulating crime, but they were soon eclipsed by positivist thinking. I list numerous weakness of positivism and argue that, instead of seeing offenders’ behavior as determined by their past, greater account should be taken of the situational inducements and opportunities to commit crime that they encounter in their everyday lives. Instead of positivism, the dominant model of criminology and crime control should be a neoclassicist, bounded rational choice model, which would introduce situational design and management changes to restrict offenders choices and modify behavior. That change in orientation would open limitless opportunities for criminologists. © 2018 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.

AB  - As the spatial carrier of people's daily behaviors, the street network and behaviors therein constitute the main spatial environment of street network, which affects criminal behavior. Previous studies have shown that there are frequent cases of robberies and thefts in the streets, and the street network pattern and routine activity subjects are both related to crime. However, there are few in-depth explorations of such a relationship. Based on the police patrol area unit of the original DP District of HS City, this paper has adopted spatial analysis and statistical analysis methods to analyze the road network data, demographic data, mobile phone signaling data and other relevant data in order to explore the relationship between crime and street morphological characteristics including geometric and topological form, the relationship between crime and routine activity subjects including dynamic population and static population, and the impact of the street network on robberies and thefts. The results have shown that the factors affecting thefts and robberies in the street network are quite different. The factors affecting the theft crime are more complex. "X-cell" street network, road network density, road network permeability of low-speed traffic, static population density and dynamic population density all have an important impact on thefts. Only the branch density has a negative effect, and the rest of the factors have a positive effect. "T-cell" street network, density of actual residents and migrants in static population are related to robberies. But the street network pattern has not shown a significant correlation with robberies. In general, the street networks with more main roads, better accessibility, higher population density, and higher population mobility are prone to thefts. The street networks with many migrants are prone to the robberies. In addition, the findings of this study can also make certain extensions to the crime pattern theory. Since the accessibility of street network often brings risks, it is proposed at the end of the paper that it is imperative to consider how to reduce the crime risks as much as possible by regulating or improving the overall spatial environment of street network during the planning and construction of a safe street network environment in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - This chapter addresses the ability of the criminological approaches that comprise Environmental Criminology to constitute an adequate theoretical framework to analyze and understand the situational aspects of crimes committed through cyberspace and to define the most appropriate prevention strategies. The chapter begins by examining how these approaches have been applied. Subsequently, the reasons why the environmental approach can offer much more in this area if some apparent obstacles are overcome are presented. Finally, a method of applying these midrange theoretical frameworks to different cybercrimes is proposed. Relying on multiple empirical studies, it is stated that the essential premise of the environmental approach is also observed in cybercrime: the existence of situational patterns. These patterns are derived from the different ways in which offenders and targets, in the absence of guardians, converge in cyber places: digital interaction environments that shape the situational opportunities in which people interact. The chapter ends by summarizing the application possibilities of approaches such as the Crime Pattern Theory and Situational Crime Prevention in connection with the Routine Activity Theory and the Rational Choice Theory. It is proposed that many of the geographical applications derived from these approaches and some of their basic theoretical premises need to be adapted while seeking to enhance their strengths and mitigate the effects of their weaknesses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The field of environmental criminology is a staple theoretical framework in contemporary criminological theory. This fully revised and expanded edition of the world’s first comprehensive and sole-authored textbook on this influential school of criminological thought covers a wide range of topics, including: the origins of environmental criminology; the primary theoretical frameworks, such as social disorganization theory, the routine activity approach, geometry of crime, rational choice perspective, and multilevel models that integrate environmental criminology; the practical application of environmental criminology; an examination of how theories are operationalized and tested; and policy implications for the practice of crime prevention. As well as these popular topics, Martin Andresen also discusses a number of topics that are at the leading edge of research within environmental criminology. New to the third edition is an expanded coverage on multilevel models of environmental criminology, harm indices, crime mapping, hot-spot policing, and future directions in environmental criminology. This text will be ideal for courses on crime prevention, where students are often encouraged to consider policy problems and apply theory to practice. This book offers up environmental criminology as a theoretical framework for making sense of complex neighborhood problems, so it is also perfect for courses on geography of crime, crime analysis, and, indeed, environmental criminology. It would also be a good supplement for courses on criminological theory. © 2024 Martin A. Andresen.

AB  - Attempts at classifying sexual offenses and the persons who commit them are reviewed relative to different ways that classifications can have value. Classifying offenses continues to be a productive exercise. The diversity of novel types of offending is being mapped and the identification of psychologically meaningful behavioral themes within broad categories of offense is promising as is the application of Routine Activities theory to target selection scripts. Classifying those who commit sexual offenses, despite considerable research effort being expended in the endeavor, has turned out to be less productive with typological models being largely superseded by dimensional systems. However, the development of standardized risk classes has value for improving communication in the sub-field of actuarial risk assessment and the development of theory-based prototypes has potential for theory development. © 2020

AB  - This study analyses 300 cases of fraudulent activities against Dutch businesses, 100 from each of the following three categories: CEO-fraud, fraudulent contract, and ghost invoice. We examine crime scripts, key characteristics of targeted businesses, and the relationship between input criminal effort and output financial benefit. Results indicate that whilst all CEO-frauds are conducted online, most of the fraudulent contracts and ghost invoices are undertaken via offline means. Both Routine Activity Theory and Rational Choice Model are evidenced-fraudsters clearly take the business size and seasonality into account, and the input criminal effort and output criminal benefit are positively correlated. Having vigilant employees is evidenced as the most effective way of fraud prevention, both online and offline. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This study provides a partial test of the relationship between actor motivations and target suitability using a routine activity framework to understand a form of cybercrime called web defacements. Specifically, the relationships between the visibility, inertia, value, and accessibility of the target in online spaces relative to the unique nonmonetary motivations of the attacker were examined. This study utilized a sample of 138,361 web defacements performed against websites hosted within the Netherlands IP space from January 2011 to April 2017. Seven multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each self-identified motive for the attack, clustered by attacker to minimize the size of standard errors. The findings demonstrated partial support for aspects of routine activity theory to account for differences in offender motivation, suggesting web defacements are similar to other forms of cybercrime. At the same time, motivations differentially shape target selection. © 2020 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology.

AB  - Traditional criminology focuses on the criminal nature of offenders; the traits and tendencies that are assumed to predispose particular individuals toward crime and antisocial behavior. In contrast, situational crime prevention (SCP) aims to systematically categorize, and respond to, the conditions in which opportunities for crime emerge. This entry introduces the origins of SCP, presents the “effort, risk, reward, provocation, excuses” framework, and provides examples of effective SCP measures across a range of settings. The main criticisms and limitations are discussed in light of existing evidence for the effectiveness of the approach and techniques. The 25 techniques of SCP are used as a framework to categorize situational peacebuilding and conflict prevention opportunities and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extant research has provided support for the micro-level predictions of rational choice models of crime. Yet, a central feature of the rational choice perspective in the broader social sciences—that it is multilevel in focus, situating individuals within broader community social structures—has been neglected within criminology. In this article, we discuss and test a model that links community structural characteristics to several individual expectations and preferences relevant to crime. Using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, we find that objective levels of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage influence individuals’ perceptions of, and preferences for, the risks, costs, and rewards associated with offending indirectly by affecting perceived disorder and perceived opportunities for legitimate avenues of success within one's neighborhood. The implications of a multilevel rational choice model of offending are discussed. © 2022 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Based on an offender spatial decision-making perspective, this burglary target location choice study aims to understand how physical and social barriers affect why residential burglars commit their crimes at particular locations in a major Chinese city. Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Temporal and spatial patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil, are analyzed considering the relevance of routine activity theory in a Latin American context. We use geo-referenced criminal event data, 2010-2013, analyzing spatial patterns using census tracts and temporal patterns considering seasons, months, days, and hours. Our analyses include difference in means tests, count-based regression models, and Kulldorff’s scan test. We find that crime in Campinas, Brazil, exhibits both temporal and spatial-temporal patterns. However, the presence of these patterns at the different temporal scales varies by crime type. Specifically, not all crime types have statistically significant temporal patterns at all scales of analysis. As such, routine activity theory works well to explain temporal and spatial-temporal patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil. However, local knowledge of Brazilian culture is necessary for understanding a portion of these crime patterns. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This paper adapts three conceptual frameworks from Environmental Criminology – Routine Activity Theory, Rational Choice Theory, and Situational Crime Prevention – to create a Crime Prevention Toolkit that helps librarians analyze and manage criminal activity in contemporary academic libraries. The toolkit is applied to a case study of patron-laptop theft at an urban academic library to demonstrate its use in analyzing criminal activity and creating a crime-problem intervention. The intervention was rapidly successful at eliminating patron-property theft. There were no patron-laptop thefts of any kind in the library after implementation of the intervention, in contrast to 12 recorded laptop thefts the previous academic year. This is the first time a research-based, conceptual framework of three theories from Environmental Criminology has been used to analyze and manage criminal activity in an academic library. It is also the first time a patron-property theft intervention in an academic library has been demonstrated effective in an empirical inquiry. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geographical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns. Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013. Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern. Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces. Conclusions: Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender’s home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers’ location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Opportunity theories of crime are concerned with situational predictors of crime and include what Jacques and Wright refer to as the "theoretical siblings": Cornish and Clarke's rational choice perspective and Cohen and Felson's routine activity approach. Routine activity approach posits that crimes take place when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian intersect in space and time. Once presented with a crime opportunity, rational choice perspective suggests that an offender weighs the costs associated with engaging in crime against the potential benefits. Such "rational" decision-making is bounded by one's life circumstances and the available information. Super Mario Bros. is side-scrolling videogame and cultural phenomenon released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The central protagonist of the game, Mario is tasked with making his way through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from her captor, Bowser, King of the Koopa. Along the way, Mario collects coins and various power-ups, and must avoid pitfalls and eliminate enemies. Mario is motivated to collect such targets by his need to survive and complete his mission. Many targets are difficult to reach due to environmental hazards and game enemies serving as guardians over the desired rewards. This chapter provides an explanation of opportunity theory and several theoretical offshoots. Perspectives are applied to Super Mario Bros., and policy implications and empirical evidence of opportunity theories of crime are presented. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - Criminal opportunity theories are an emerging perspective used in place-based criminology to explain why certain locations have more crime than others. These theories suggest the confluence of social and physical characteristics of places can present the necessary "chemistry" for crime incidents to occur there. The Bachelor is a popular reality TV show where one individual gets to simultaneously date different contestants to explore potential relationships with the end goal of providing a marriage proposal to one contestant. This chapter uses criminal opportunity theories to present a framework to understand how the romantic chemistry for a relationship develops on The Bachelor. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigate the concept of “criminal failure” in sexual crimes and the relevance of various theoretical frameworks for its understanding: individual offender's rational choice, environmental influences and routine activities, victimological characteristics from lifestyle theory, and crime interaction factors. We examined a sample of 1121 “failed” cases (i.e., attempted but not completed) and 1500 “successful” cases (i.e., completed) of sexual assault that occurred in France between 1990 and 2018. We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime. This understudied area can yield important theoretical knowledge and practical implications regarding the prevention of sexual crimes. © 2024

AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Scottish legal system is a unique jurisdiction, as jurors are able to give not proven verdicts in addition to the well-known Anglo-American verdicts (guilty and not guilty). The not proven verdict has never been legally defined, meaning that currently legal practitioners can only estimate why a not proven verdict has been given. The main aim of this study was to investigate if jurors violate the regularity principle, which is commonly incorporated in many rational choice models, by testing if the introduction of the not proven verdict has an impact on the outcomes given by jurors. In addition, this study aimed to test if the introduction of the not proven verdict has an impact upon how the not guilty verdict is perceived by jurors. In this study, 128 participants listened to two vignettes centred on homicide trials. Jurors could give one of two verdicts in one of the vignettes and one of three verdicts in the other vignette. The vignettes were counterbalanced in regard to how many verdicts could be given at the end of them. It was found that jurors in a three-verdict system were less likely to give a not guilty verdict in comparison to jurors in a two-verdict system, showing that jurors violate the regularity principle and that the not proven verdict may change how the not guilty verdict is perceived. The findings of this research have implications in relation to juror communication, article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights and juror rationality. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: To examine a component of crime pattern theory by exploring whether the spatial predictors of crime vary across seasons. Methods: The relationships among potentially criminogenic places and illicit markets and seasonal census block robbery counts in Philadelphia, PA, were explored using simultaneously estimated negative binomial regression models. The equality of predictors’ effects on street robbery across seasons was subsequently tested using Wald’s tests. Results: While many facilities and illicit markets were positively associated with street robbery, there were few seasonal differences in their effects. Only the effect of high schools during the fall was greater than during the winter and summer as hypothesized. Conclusions: The results suggest areas with facilities and illicit markets that are used consistently across the year experience the highest street robbery levels regardless of the season. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The legalization of medical marijuana remains a controversial policy. An important dimension of marijuana legalization is the siting of dispensaries and their influence on a surrounding community. Specifically, dispensaries, if they engender criminogenic opportunities via changes in routine activities, have the potential to increase crimes in the areas surrounding medicinal marijuana dispensaries (MMDs). Using a quasi-experimental design, we examine the relationship between MMDs and crime using micro-spatial units in a novel location. Street level geocoded crime data for violent and nonviolent crime patterns before and after the opening of MMD’s in Washington, D.C. Crime is analyzed with 100 m buffers around each dispensary and control location drawn from propensity score matching. Differences between crime rates pre- and postoperation are compared. With the exception of one location, crime decreased or remained constant in geographical areas following the opening of a dispensary. MMDs do not appear to have an immediate criminogenic effect. Implications for future research regarding potential confounding factors and data limitations are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - In recent years, statistical methods have been applied to the study of crime patterns. However, these schemes have several drawbacks that prevent accurate modeling of complex behaviors. Agent-based models (ABM) allow the modeling of human behavior by employing simple rules that consider each agent's neighborhood. In this paper, a new agent-based model is proposed to emulate crime patterns produced by the interaction of different urban actors, such as offenders (criminals), citizens, and defenders (police officers). Using this approach, the simulation results provide escape trajectories and robbery frequencies that can be used to create or improve public security strategies. Although our scheme can be generically applied, we validated the model by considering different scenarios for the case of Guadalajara, Mexico. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme creates realistic offender behaviors that efficiently predict criminal patterns and provides essential data that allow the creation and improvement of public security strategies to reduce the number of crimes.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 prevention and control measures on the hotspots of residential burglary, the data of crimes that occurred during the First Level Response period of Major Public Health Emergencies in Beijing in 2020 and the same period in 2019 were collected, and the changes of hotspots during the two periods were compared by using kernel density estimation and predictive accuracy index. Consequently, the environmental features such as street network, point of interest (POI) diversity, crime locations, and repeat victimization in significantly varied hotspot areas were investigated. The results show that: 1) After the outbreak of the pandemic, the occurrence of residential burglary in the core urban areas of Beijing dropped significantly, and daily occurrence of crimes during the First Level Response period in 2020 decreased by 66.8% compared with the same days in 2019. 2) The eight major hotspots that existed in 2019 apparently declined during the corresponding days in 2020, five of them basically disappeared, and three hotspots weakened. 3) The declined hotspots were generally clustered around traffic hubs, areas with high diversity of POIs, clustered crimes, and repeat victimizations. 4) Home isolation and social restriction strategies implemented during the First Level Response period reduced the opportunities of offenders, and the real-name inspection adopted in public places increased the exposure risk of offenders, which are the main reasons for the hotspots decline during the pandemic. This work has some implications for crime prevention and police resources optimization during the pandemic. © 2023, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic “edges,” as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Immigrants and natives are generally comparable in committing violent crimes in many Western cities. However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: The extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This book uses a crime science approach to explore the ways in which child sexual abuse material (CSAM) can be tackled. It describes the CSAM ecosystem, focusing on the ways in which it is produced, distributed and consumed and explores different interventions that can be used to tackle each issue. Eliminating Online Child Sexual Abuse Material provides a methodical approach to unpacking and understanding this growing problem, identifies approaches that have been shown to work and offers alternatives that might be tried. This analysis is set within a crime science context that draws on rational choice, routine activities, situation crime prevention and environmental criminology to better understand the nature of the problem and the potential ways in which it may be solved. This book is intended for policymakers and practitioners working in child protection, online harms and related areas and for students studying sexual violence or internet-related crime. The book will also be of interest to crime scientists as it provides another example of how the approach can be used to understand and reduce crime. © 2023 Rick Brown. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: In the field of crime prevention there are several theoretical approaches explaining why crime occurs and how to prevent it. Three of them – routine activity theory, crime pattern theory and the theory of crime-as-choice – are logically tested in this work. The point of departure is to test if the theories are logical consistent and logical valid, irrespective of whether the criterion for criminal intent is changed from direct intention to negligence. Design/methodology/approach: The issues will be explored in a logical structure by a first-order logic propositional analysis. Findings: The analysis shows that all three theories are logical consistent, but only routine activity theory is logical valid. The conclusion is that crime prevention should in general assume that routine activity theory is the legitimate theory and that social prevention as a prevention strategy is logically unnecessary to adopt because it does not matter whether the offender is motivated (direct intention) or not (negligence). Practical implications: It does not really matter if the authors theoretically treat white-collar offenders as motivated, because if they have committed an actus reus, they are an offender according to the objective requisites. This means that the best strategies to prevent a potential white-collar criminal are situational prevention, i.e. complicate their access to money, where it becomes irrelevant if the potential offender has a mens rea or not. What counts is the prevention of actus reus by a potential offender. Originality/value: As far as I know, no one has previously investigated the logical consistency and/or logical validity of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory and the theory of crime-as-choice as theories of crime prevention. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objective: According to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes. Methods: Geocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime. Results: Accounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted. Conclusions: The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender - Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is well established that offenders’ routine activity locations (nodes) shape their crime locations, but research examining the geography of offenders’ routine activity spaces has to date largely been limited to a few core nodes such as homes and prior offense locations, and to small study areas. This paper explores the utility of police data to provide novel insights into the spatial extent of, and overlap between, individual offenders’ activity spaces. It includes a wider set of activity nodes (including relatives’ homes, schools, and non-crime incidents) and broadens the geographical scale to a national level, by comparison to previous studies. Using a police dataset including n = 60,229 burglary, robbery, and extra-familial sex offenders in New Zealand, a wide range of activity nodes were present for most burglary and robbery offenders, but fewer for sex offenders, reflecting sparser histories of police contact. In a novel test of the criminal profiling assumptions of homology and differentiation in a spatial context, we find that those who offend in nearby locations tend to share more activity space than those who offend further apart. However, in finding many offenders’ activity spaces span wide geographic distances, we highlight challenges for crime location choice research and geographic profiling practice. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Opportunity theories of crime seek to explain the occurrence of crime rather than simply the existence of criminal dispositions. They emphasize the fundamental element in the criminal act of opportunity: how this arises, how it is perceived, evaluated and acted on by those with criminal dispositions. This volume brings together influential research articles on opportunity theories of crime by leading theorists such as Cohen and Felson on routine activity theory and Clarke and Cornish on the bounded rational choice perspective. The articles also include more recent theoretical developments and studies of situational crime prevention of specific twenty-first century crimes. These articles attest to the sheer volume as well to as the richness and the variety of work designed to reduce crime that has forever changed the face of criminology and criminal justice. © Mangai Natarajan 2011.

AB  - Empirical tests of the deterrence doctrine have suffered from two deficiencies: (1) they have rarely been conducted within the context of a more general theory of social control, and (2) they have confounded the effects of sanction threats on different kinds of offending decisions. In this paper, deterrence variables (perceived certainty and severity) were incorporated into a rational choice model of common (minor) delinquent offending. The rational choice perspective presumes that crime and delinquency are the products of imperfectly informed choice and that decisions to offend are made, assessed, and remade. It was assumed here that decisions to offend and cease offending would in part be affected by the contemplation of sanction threats in addition to material, affective, and moral considerations. The data in support of the inclusion of deterrence variables in a rational choice model were equivocal. Although perceptions of certain punishment had a significant effect on the decision to commit and desist from some offenses, the observed effects were marginal and far less consequential than were the effects of social costs and other considerations. The data did indicate that certainty of punishment (but not severity) affects some offending decisions. © 2000 Stephen Farrall.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the role of athletes' support networks in doping in sport from a crime prevention perspective. To achieve this objective, the researchers conducted an in-depth script analysis of documents related to investigations in 2012 by the United States Anti-Doping Agency and in 2015 by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission of the doping programme carried out by the US Postal Service cycling team between 1996 and 2012. The results suggest that athletes' support networks - such as team doctors, sports scientists, team directors and family members - play a critical role as social facilitators in doping in sport by encouraging, supporting and protecting both the doping programmes and the athletes who participate in them. This paper argues that a greater proportion of prevention measures must focus beyond the athlete themselves and on the activities of individuals within an athlete's support network. The paper proposes several situational prevention strategies specifically targeting the activities of social facilitators. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The research objectives were to examine the concentration of crime and its temporal patterns in Niš and compare the related research results in spatial criminology. Longitudinal property and violent crime data were geocoded and assigned to three types of grid cells. Descriptive statistics were used to examine crime concentration, and spatial stability of crime was tested using a spatial point pattern test. The findings suggest an intense concentration of all crime types within all areal units and years of study. The higher rates of concentration were found in the analysis of less common robbery and violent crime. Findings of spatial pattern analysis suggest moderate to a high degree of similarity in spatial patterns among all crime types. However, sensitivity analysis indicates significant changes in the spatial distribution of both property and violent crime. Therefore, an alternative method is applied. Theoretical implications are discussed, highlighting routine activities and crime pattern theory. The study aims to instigate more spatial analysis of crime and evidence-based criminal policies within the region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Purpose: This paper analyzes trading and tipping activities in insider trading litigation decided by federal courts from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. Design/methodology/approach: Legal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes. Findings: Results of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements. Originality/value: This paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Studies are showing evidence of the effect of changes in routine activities due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on crime levels in many cities worldwide. This study evaluates the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporal and spatial patterns of crime in three major cities under very different national contexts. Each of the three countries and cities experienced different levels of pandemic restrictions and societal closure. The cities of New York (the United States), São Paulo (Brazil), and Stockholm (Sweden) were selected as cases. Temporal quantitative methods, spatial statistics techniques, and Geographical Information System (GIS) underlie the methodology used in this study. Findings show that there is a statistically significant break in the trend in crime levels after the stay-at-home orders were implemented in New York City, São Paulo, and Stockholm in the first months of 2020; the only exception was for murder. Such an impact varies by crime type and city context, but increases again after a few months, indicating how fast crime and criminals adapt. Residential burglary decreased, whereas nonresidential burglary increased overall. Changes in the levels and geography of vehicle thefts were observed, with an overall increase of significant cold spots but, in several cases, also solidification of existing crime concentrations in known crime attractors and in some deprived areas. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This chapter reviews what is known about victim selection-that is, the question of why offenders select some people, but not others, to be victims of crime. It first addresses theoretical perspectives on victim selection, namely the structural-choice model of victim selection, social interactionism, and target congruence. It then describes three data sources that have been used in prior research to study victim selection: police reports, victimization surveys, and offender interviews. Subsequently, empirical findings on victim selection are reviewed and organized into nine subsections: victims' demographic characteristics, psychological characteristics, physical characteristics, behavior, biological characteristics, prior victimization, relationship to the offender, behavior during the offense, and the role of randomness. The final section discusses research gaps and potential future directions in the field, including an emphasis on theoretical explanations and mediators, cross-cultural studies, methodological innovation and diversity, interactions between victim and offender characteristics, and generality across crime types and subpopulations. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - This paper analyses key differences between two paradigms dominant in social research on online crime: the more prevalent neopositivist paradigm and the more recent critical–cultural paradigm. Based on an extensive analysis of up-to-date literature, the key paradigmatic oppositions in online crime research encompass: 1) in neopositivism, the conceptual separation of technological and social practices, the reliance on rational choice approaches in theory, especially routine activity theory, and the tendency towards quantitative research methods; 2) in the critical–cultural paradigm, a complex and context-dependent approach to the technosocial as a continuum, theoretical roots in critical theory, cultural criminology, actor-network theory, and feminist theory, and the emphasis on qualitative methods. The field of online crime research in Lithuania is dominated by legal studies, while social research is rare and fragmented. The existing social research of online crime in Lithuania lacks a solid theoretical basis in either paradigm. Methodologically, there are examples of both quantitative (surveys, analysis of registered crime statistics) and qualitative studies (interviews, discussion groups, content analysis). However, most of the studies are small-scale and their scarcity makes it nearly impossible to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and complimentary potential of each approach in the specific national and regional context. © 2021 Maryja Šupa.

AB  - Do people think about offending risk in verbal or numerical terms? Does the elicitation method affect reported subjective probabilities? Rational choice models require potential outcomes (e.g., benefits/costs) to be weighted by their probability of occurrence. Indeed, the subjective likelihood of being apprehended is the central construct in criminological deterrence theory—the so-called certainty principle. Yet, extant literature has measured the construct inconsistently and with little attention to potential consequences. Using a series of randomized experiments conducted with nationwide samples of American adults (aged 18 and over), this study examines the degree of correspondence between verbal and numeric measures of apprehension risk, assesses the durability of numeric estimates specifically, and attempts to elicit how respondents naturally think about apprehension risk. The findings suggest that laypeople are somewhat inconsistent in their use of both verbal and numeric descriptors of probability, their numeric estimates of probability are unlikely to be precise or durable, and many seem to prefer thinking of risk in verbal terms (compared to numeric terms). Researchers should consider including both verbal and numeric measures of probability and explore alternative measurement strategies, including anchoring vignettes, which have been valuable in standardizing verbal responses in other disciplines. © 2020 Georgia State University.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that tourists are particularly likely to be victimized, especially with regard to property crimes like theft from tourist accommodation (burglary). Guided by the criminal opportunity perspective, we examine the extent to which environmental and routine activities-related factors explain burglary using the data from a sample of Australian tourists (N = 1,027). Bayesian variable selection with a stochastic search algorithm was used to analyze the data. Our findings demonstrate the utility of opportunity theories in explaining crime against tourists. We found that the location and type of accommodation together with the use of target hardening and guardianship strategies are helpful for understanding burglary from tourist accommodation. Practical implications for crime prevention are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us? Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets. Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Historically speaking, criminological theory tends to pay great attention to identifying the various sources of criminal motivation while downplaying the opportunity to carry out crime in particular situations. However, perspectives that address situational opportunity have gained tremendous traction in the field over the past several decades to the point that there is now a substantial body of theory and research on the issue. This article reviews such theory and research within the context of four overlapping yet distinct lines of inquiry. First, we review scholarship that uses situational opportunity to understand individual victimization. Second, we discuss theory and research that link situational opportunity and high-crime places. Third, we explore scholarship that embraces a multicontextual opportunity perspective to understand crime and victimization events within neighborhood contexts. Fourth, we examine work that integrates situational opportunity into explanations of offending. Copyright © 2018 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article employs Routine Activities and Crime Pattern theories to explore the factors that lead to increased risk of bike theft, focusing on Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority Metrorail (Metro) property. Utilizing the Metro bike census and other data, we use negative binomial regression analysis to model the relationship between bike thefts and various station- and neighborhood-level risk factors that can either create or close off opportunities for bike thefts. The findings indicate that bike thefts around Metro stations are positively influenced by the number of targets, as measured by the number of bikes per station, and the presence of likely offenders, as measured by the volume of auto-related larcenies. Stations that have greater guardianship, as measured by the number of nearby businesses, are less likely to experience bike theft. The implications of these findings for theory, methodological considerations, and crime prevention are discussed. We suggest that bike racks can be placed in locations with greater informal guardianship, and discuss ways our findings can inform traditional interventions such as bike locking campaigns. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Research addressing the link between crime and parks has primarily focused on fear of crime with limited empirical research verifying or denying a crime-park relationship. This article examines the results of two nearly identical studies examining the relationship between neighborhood parks and crime, in two very dissimilar cities, Philadelphia, PA and Louisville, KY. These cities vary greatly in size, population density, median income, per cent minorities and per cent living in poverty, among other factors. Findings of the studies, which are grounded in theories of environmental criminology, show that neighborhood parks are associated with increased crime levels in their immediate surroundings. In addition, although characteristics of parks significantly related to crime levels in each city vary somewhat, findings clearly demonstrate the underlying importance guardianship plays is explaining the criminogenic nature of neighborhood parks. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The economics literature generally supports a positive theoretical link between income inequality and crime. However, despite this consensus, empirical evidence has struggled to yield definitive conclusions. To address this puzzle, I conducted a meta-analysis based on 1,341 estimates drawn from 43 studies in economics journals. The findings indicate a statistically significant but economically insignificant true effect of inequality on crime, ranging between 0.007 and 0.123 using UWLS FAT-PET and advanced methods. In essence, if there is an impact of inequality on crime, it is, at best, minimal. Additionally, there is some limited evidence suggesting positive publication bias. Results from Bayesian model averaging reveal that inequality does not affect exclusively property crime, as predicted by the rational choice models. Moreover, this analysis shows that inequality measures which are sensitive to changes in income at the middle and top of the distribution are associated with higher coefficients. The study also underscores the biases arising from the exclusion of relevant variables. The implications of this research suggest that inequality may not be the primary motivator for criminal behaviour, with other factors potentially playing more significant roles. Lastly, if inequality does affect crime, it might do so in different ways than those discussed by the majority of the existing empirical studies. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders’ knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders’ pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members’ home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge—where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities—and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders’ crime location choices. © 2024 Georgia State University.

AB  - This chapter provides a brief overview of sexual offenses and those who commit them and the reasons for the sexual offenses. It is important to note that pedophilia and other paraphilias have distinct clinical definitions and criteria for diagnosis. Most of the theories that have been developed to explain sexual offending focus on factors that relate to an individual's history and/or their characteristics, thoughts, and demographics, as is evidenced in the integrated theory of sexual offending (ITSO). Sexual abuse incidents, for the most part, occur in contexts of ordinary social interaction, and situational approaches, such as routine activities theories and rational choice theory, can be used to understand why crimes take place in particular locations, at particular times. Routine activities theorists view crimes as the "function of the convergence of likely offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardians". © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We study the emergence of new forms of law violations in Latin America during the coronavirus pandemic. Based on data from online news articles, we construct a typology of “new” crimes: (1) hate or fear crimes against health workers and hospitals; (2) illegal denials of public mobility out of fear of infection; (3) looting and other traditional crimes justified by the pandemic; and (4) violations of pandemic regulations. Studies of crime during the pandemic have focused on traditional crime and have been based on rational choice theory and a routine activities approach. We argue that in order to understand the recent crime trends in Latin America, these must be accompanied by other theories of crime, together with a better understanding of the role of the State. Our typology can be a starting point for discussions and further research on the complex relationship between criminal behavior and policy responses in pandemics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2023.

AB  - There is now a sizable literature on connections between homelessness, crime, and criminal legal system contact. We review studies on these relationships, focusing mostly on links between the adversity that often characterizes homelessness—the need for shelter, food, and income—and offending, victimization, and involvement with the criminal legal system. We concentrate on multivariate studies from the United States and Canada and consider research on youth and adults. We begin with a short discussion of some of the challenges of studying these relationships. We follow our review of research on homeless conditions with a summary of research that has used data from homeless samples to advance a broad array of explanations of crime; a collection that includes strain, routine activities and lifestyle exposure, differential association, social control, rational choice, life course, and criminal capital theories.

AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers’ crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers’ crime location choices, but not native robbers’. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Over the past two decades, research on radicalisation, political extremism, and terrorism has become one of the fastest growing sub-fields within criminology. In this chapter, we identify a set of articles appearing in leading criminology journals and classify the major theoretical perspectives taken by each. To begin, the fact that we could identify over 100 relevant articles suggests that political extremism has become a major focus in criminology. Moreover, nearly four-fifths of these articles have appeared since 2010. For those articles grounded in specific theories, the most common perspectives were situational/routine activities and rational choice/deterrence. While studying radicalisation and terrorism through a criminological lens is becoming more common, many influential criminology theories are still uncommon (e.g. social control and symbolic interaction) or altogether absent (e.g. labelling and biological). We consider the implications of these changes for criminology theory and future research. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Joel Busher, Leena Malkki and Sarah Marsden; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases—100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This chapter presents the current state of terrorism research through the lens of criminological theories of victimization. Reasons for why researchers and policymakers should not assume that victims and targets of terrorism are random are discussed. Several criminological victimization theories are outlined and the few instances where they have been applied to terrorism are highlighted. Datasets, which can potentially be used to study terrorism victimization, are also identified and their potential applications to victimization research are reviewed. Finally, future research pathways are suggested for the mostly unexamined phenomenon of ideologically-motivated, violent victimization. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods: We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results: The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion: Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The current study conducts a spatial-temporal examination of physical environment for walkability and crime in block groups located across nine U.S. cities. We aggregated the crime data for each of the different crime types using the block group where the crime occurred and the 2-hour period of the 24-hour day when the crime occurred. We estimated models at each 2-hour time slot (for weekdays and weekends), separately, to look at the effect of the walkability measure on crime at different hours of the day. Our results show that the crime-enhancing effect of physical environment for walkability changes across different hours of the day, and such temporal patterns vary by different types of crime. Crime-enhancing effect of physical environment for walkability is relatively stronger during very early morning time (midnight-4 am), and the risk of crime as a result of neighborhood walkability peaks in the late afternoon (2–4 or 4–6 pm). The measure of physical environment for walkability has different effect on crime patterns across hours of the day as the usage and meaning of physical environment and routine activities of people visiting the area, and thus the structures of criminal opportunities and guardianship capability temporally vary at different time periods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crime location choice has been a central theme of crime geography research. However, the current research reveals little about the spatial differences among different age groups of criminals when they choose crime locations. Using kernel density estimation and discrete spatial choice models in ZG City, China, this study aims to explore the spatial variation in crime location choices of street robbers at different ages. We also examine the different influences of activity nodes, supervision role, and social disorganization on crime location choice. The results demonstrate that there are significant spatial differences in crime location choices by street robbers at different ages. Juvenile robbers tend to commit crimes in labor-intensive industrial clusters and primary and secondary school areas, young adult robbers tend to commit crimes only in labor-intensive industrial clusters, and adult robbers prefer urban areas with transportation hubs. Additionally, this study demonstrates that age-related activity nodes, the supervision role of the ambient population, and the proportion of youngsters are the main factors for such spatial differences. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Cybercafés have impact on crime location choices of juvenile and young adult robbers, while transportation hubs affect those of young adult and adult robbers, and bars and schools influence all the three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. (2) The supervision role exerted by the ambient population is greater for young adult and adult robbers compared with juvenile robbers. (3) Young adult robbers are more likely to target communities with more youngsters but juvenile and adult robbers are not. (4) Journey to crime has a significant negative effect on target choices, especially on juvenile robbers. In addition, these findings have great informative value for crime prevention and social governance. For example, (i) in labor-intensive industrial clusters where juvenile robbers frequently commit crimes, we can regulate the number of age-related activity nodes such as cybercafés and bars; (ii) in transportation hubs and their surrounding communities where adult robbers commit crimes intensively, we can encourage the persistence of the ambient population to persist and play a better supervision role; (iii) in communities predominated by youth population, we can survey delinquent juveniles to enhance the precise guidance and support. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - The age–crime curve has been regarded as a stylized fact of the age–crime relationship. However, recent studies have found that some Asian countries have an age–crime distribution that deviates from the archetypal age–crime curve. This variation has been attributed to cultural factors associated with age effects. Using age-specific arrest data from Korea for the years 1976 through 2019, this study offers a complementary explanation of divergent age–crime patterns across countries. We make an empirical case that the observed difference between the Korean age–crime distribution and the archetypical age–crime curve in Western countries cannot be due to contextual influence on age effects alone. The age–crime relationship in Korea shows both static and dynamic characteristics. The age–period–cohort analysis of variance shows that age effects largely explain the age–crime relationship, but period and cohort effects also explain the change in the age–crime relationship over time. Moreover, the extent to which each effect manifests depends on the type of crime. Based on our findings, we propose hypotheses regarding the role of social context in shaping each effect. We suggest that cultural factors largely shaped age effects by creating age-graded changes in the social control mechanism and in routine activities. In addition, we suggest that other contextual factors, such as population dynamics, simultaneously shaped period and cohort effects by changing the level of social control, and routine activities across birth cohorts. Both cultural and historical dimensions of social context are required to understand divergent age–crime patterns across countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders’ crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times. Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models. Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime. Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: The journey to crime is well-researched in criminology. Fundamental to many of these studies is the offending probability by distance function, a distribution comprised of two key components – distance decay and the buffer zone. However, it is difficult to measure this relationship accurately because of intensive data requirements. Here, we explore this challenge in detail and quantify data requirements. Methods: We define and describe the buffer zone and outline two proposed explanations. Using this framework, four critical research considerations that avoid the ecological fallacy are identified, and a testing procedure proposed. Finally, we conduct simulation analyses to establish minimum data requirements. Results: We conclude 50 or more observations are needed to reliably determine the shape of an offender's travel distribution, a number much higher than used in previous studies. Two empirical case studies of prolific predatory offenders support these findings. Conclusion: Understanding crime journeys is relevant for both theory and practice. Crime travel is central to routine activity and crime pattern theories, and a critical factor in offender decision-making, target choice, spatial displacement, crime scripts, geographic profiling, crime prevention, and risk assessments. The relationship between distance and offending probability must be accurately measured to be properly understood. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The robbery is one of the main crimes in Mexico City. The policies implemented by the police bodies are focalized in reactive actions and few had been made from a prevention perspective. The theoretical background is provided by the routine activities and crime patterns. To measure the relationship a multiple regression model was test. The data include criminal warrants of robbery (PGJDF, 2010) and other socioeconomic variables (INEGI, 2010), both at census tract level. The methodology used is a Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR). The results of the spatial regression model show that commerce and service land use, public transportation stations and the percentage of male population of 18 to 24 years old increase significantly the opportunities to commit a robbery. The results provide some guiding for the design of security public policies focused on the prevention of the criminal activity. © 2018, Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

AB  - Rational choice theory (RCT) has generated a large body of empirical research in many fields of the social sciences. In criminology, RCT posits that decision makers weigh the costs and benefits attached to their various choices (Becker, 1968; Clarke and Cornish, 1985; Cornish and Clarke, 1986b). Although some researchers have embraced this premise, it has a number of detractors, especially concerning its applicability to sexual offending. Some assume that individuals who commit a sex crime have mental health problems, are incapable of rational thinking, and are driven by uncontrollable urges that preclude an RCT model (e.g., Hayward, 2007). However, this chapter demonstrates that by bolstering the conception of RCT with empirical findings from psychology, economics, and other criminological fields, this approach becomes useful in the study of sexual offending. The first part of this chapter reviews the principles of RCT in criminology, including their roots and their validation in samples of individuals convicted for a sex crime. The second part comprehensively examines developments in decision-making research that are instrumental in the evolution of criminological RCT. Developmental aspects of decision making, the influence of emotional states, expertise research, and rationality in decisions over the criminal career are all important concepts investigated in the second part. The chapter closes by proposing an updated criminological rational choice model that better explains sexually coercive decision making. Within this framework and throughout this chapter, individuals who commit a sex crime are framed as decision makers choosing to commit the crime and the cluster of decisions made in the context of sexual crimes are referred to as sexually coercive decision making. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Patrick Lussier and Eric Beauregard; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - The importance of space and place in criminology has been known for almost 200 years. The overarching pattern of this research is that, despite the various motivations for crime, crime is patterned across space and those crime patterns are stable over time. Consequently, understanding the nature of those spatial patterns is critical for understanding crime. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new set of theories emerged to explain the spatial patterns of crime: routine activity theory, geometry of crime and rational choice theory - collectively known as environmental criminology. Routine activity theory, developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson, states that in order to have a criminal event, a motivated offender and a suitable target must converge in space and time in the absence of a capable guardian. The origins of the contemporary theories within environmental criminology are largely related to, or became associated with, crime prevention. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Avi Brisman, Eamonn Carrabine and Nigel South; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Based on a wide version of rational choice theory, the paper aims at explaining and empirically analysing criminal action in a situation-specific manner as the result of a two-stage decision process. Theoretically, we draw special attention to the relevance of utility components for criminal decision making, while the empirical focus is on the formulation of an adequate statistical model for two-stage sequential decision processes. Empirical analyses are based on data collected by means of a mail survey (n = 2,383) of a disproportionally stratified random sample of residents from an East German city. For hypothesis testing, we estimate a series of sequential logit-models from the general class of discrete choice models (Hensher et al. 2005; Train 2009). Results indicate that aspects of utility guide actions on both stages of the decision process. Finally, these implications are being discussed from a theoretical and methodological perspective. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cybercrime against critical infrastructure such as nuclear reactors, power plants, and dams has been increasing in frequency and severity. Recent literature regarding these types of attacks has been extensive but due to the sensitive nature of this field, there is very little empirical data. We address these issues by integrating Routine Activity Theory and Rational Choice Theory, and we create a classification tool called TRACI (Taxonomy for Risk Assessment of Cyberattacks on Critical Infrastructure). We take a Design Science Research approach to develop, evaluate, and refine the proposed artifact. We use mix methods to demonstrate that our taxonomy can successfully capture the characteristics of various cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. TRACI consists of three dimensions, and each dimension contains its own subdimensions. The first dimension comprises of hacker motivation, which can be financial, socio-cultural, thrill-seeking, and/or economic. The second dimension represents the assets such as cyber, physical, and/or cyber-physical components. The third dimension is related to threats, vulnerabilities, and controls that are fundamental to establishing and maintaining an information security posture and overall cyber resilience. Our work is among the first to utilize criminological theories and Design Science to create an empirically validated artifact for improving critical infrastructure risk management. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, environmental criminologists have explored the application of agent-based models (ABMs) of crime events and various theoretical frameworks applied to understand them. Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort. © 2023

AB  - Previous studies suggest that climate variability and change impact both violent and property crimes. To investigate the mechanism, time series of crime rates (crime incidents per million people) and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and haze) are decomposed into three components– long-term trends, seasonality and daily variations (or “noise”). Based on a 12-year dataset of daily crime (robbery, minimal violent robbery (MVR), assault, rape and homicide) numbers in Beijing, China, the correlation between climate variability and crime rate is examined for each component. The results show that in terms of seasonality, strong positive relations are observed for temperature-to-MVR, temperature-to-assault, temperature-to-rape, and relative-humidity-to-MVR but negative relations for haze-to-MVR, haze-to-assault, and haze-to-rape, which can be explained by Routine Activity Theory. In terms of daily variations, temperature, rainfall and haze are key factors. The correlations are all positive for temperature-to-assault, temperature-to-rape, temperature-to-homicide, rainfall-to-MVR, rainfall-to-robbery and rainfall-to-homicide. However, the relations between haze and crimes are more complicated. Specifically, the correlations are negative for haze-to-MVR and haze-to-robbery, but positive for haze-to-homicide, which can be interpreted by Crime Pattern Theory and also influenced by offenders' bounded rationality. © 2020

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. © Mangai Natarajan 2011.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background Cryptomarkets represent an important drug market innovation by bringing buyers and sellers of illegal drugs together in a ‘hidden’ yet public online marketplace. We ask: How do cryptomarket drug sellers and buyers perceive the risks of detection and arrest, and attempt to limit them? Methods We analyse selected texts produced by vendors operating on the first major drug cryptomarket, Silk Road (N = 600) alongside data extracted from the marketplace discussion forum that include buyer perspectives. We apply Fader's (2016) framework for understanding how drug dealers operating ‘offline’ attempt to reduce the risk of detection and arrest: visibility reduction, charge reduction and risk distribution. Results We characterize drug transactions on cryptomarkets as ‘stretched’ across time, virtual and physical space, and handlers, changing the location and nature of risks faced by cryptomarket users. The key locations of risk of detection and arrest by law enforcement were found in ‘offline’ activities of cryptomarket vendors (packaging and delivery drop-offs) and buyers (receiving deliveries). Strategies in response involved either creating or disrupting routine activities in line with a non-offending identity. Use of encrypted communication was seen as ‘good practice’ but often not employed. ‘Drop shipping’ allowed some Silk Road vendors to sell illegal drugs without the necessity of handling them. Conclusion Silk Road participants neither viewed themselves as immune to, nor passively accepting of, the risk of detection and arrest. Rational choice theorists have viewed offending decisions as constrained by limited access to relevant information. Cryptomarkets as ‘illicit capital’ sharing communities provide expanded and low-cost access to information enabling drug market participants to make more accurate assessments of the risk of apprehension. The abundance of drug market intelligence available to those on both sides of the law may function to speed up innovation in illegal drug markets, as well as necessitate and facilitate the development of law enforcement responses. © 2016

AB  - This chapter considers the value of using criminological theory to explore, understand, and help prevent breaches and threats to academic integrity. The chapter focuses on assignment outsourcing (also known as contract cheating). Different criminological theories are presented and discussed for their relevance and application to the outsourcing of assignments in higher education. Theories may support educators in understanding why students choose to turn to outsourcing and how these behaviors manifest. Included theories consider external stressors and strains placed on people, which may lead to cheating; everyday scenarios encountered by people which may lead to conditions conducive to cheating; and modeled and reinforced behaviors that explain how people learn what is acceptable behavior in different contexts. Finally, other theories are presented which explicate excuses and controls that can either encourage or prevent academic misconduct. The chapter presents the foundations of the theories and how these can be used when designing strategies to reduce instances of outsourcing by students. The chapter concludes by presenting the benefits of considering the problem of assignment outsourcing from an interdisciplinary perspective. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Explaining how offenders choose a crime location is one of the central themes of crime geography. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice mostly considers the impact of the built environment and social environment, without considering the impact of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery and its temporal difference. To fill this gap, this study integrated ambient population and surveillance cameras in assessing street robbers' decision making and its time effects in ZG City of China, by using the discrete spatial choice modeling. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant negative impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a protective role in preventing street robbers' criminal activities. Interestingly, we found that the protective effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. The protective role of ambient population and surveillance cameras is stable daily through the week, but diurnally, the influence of ambient population shows temporal fluctuation, while the impact of surveillance cameras is temporally stable. These findings can be of some reference for police control and crime geography research by: 1) Carrying out the experimental evaluation of surveillance camera system's prevention and control effect, and dynamic optimization and adjustment of surveillance cameralocations. 2) Arranging a suitable amount of mixed functional land in urban planning or urban renewal to strengthen the moderation of ambient population through planning or management. 3) Focusing on diurnal variability in future studies of the time effects. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - This study investigates whether crime patterns fluctuate periodically throughout the year using data containing different property crime types in two Canadian cities with differing climates. Using police report data, a series of ordinary least squares (OLS; Vancouver, British Columbia) and negative binomial (Ottawa, Ontario) regressions were employed to examine the corresponding temporal patterns of property crime in Vancouver (2003-2013) and Ottawa (2006-2008). Moreover, both aggregate and disaggregate models were run to examine whether different weather and temporal variables had a distinctive impact on particular offences. Overall, results suggest that cities that experience greater variations in weather throughout the year have more distinct increases of property offences in the summer months and that different climate variables affect certain crime types, thus advocating for disaggregate analysis in the future. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This study examined patterns of motor vehicle theft (MVT) in Lagos using routine activity, social disorganization, and Charnov's prey selection models. Findings showed that the rate of auto theft is determined by opportunity, the flow of cars, the level of guardianship and social disorganization factors. Furthermore, the distribution of thefts across car model was very uneven as some cars models were stolen at much higher rates than the others. Charnov's prey selection model suggests that such uneven targeting should be related to variation in the quantity, expected payoffs, and handling costs associated with different car models. Having exploited the quantity, findings confirmed that differences in quantity of car models explained some of the thefts. A comparison of theft and quantity of different car models rank order showed a significant positive relationship (r = 0.617, p <.00). This study found some support for social disorganization theory and routine activity theory as a number of the expected relationships between offenders' characteristics, location variables, and MVT were observed. The study also found support for Charnov's prey selection model as the most common cars on the street of Lagos were also the most stolen. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences. © 2019

AB  - A challenge for studies assessing routine activities theory is accounting for the spatial and temporal confluence of offenders and targets given that people move about during the daytime and nighttime. We propose exploiting social media (Twitter) data to construct estimates of the population at various locations at different times of day, and assess whether these estimates help predict the amount of crime during two-hour time periods over the course of the day. We address these questions using crime data for 97,428 blocks in the Southern California region, along with geocoded information on tweets in the region over an eight month period. The results show that this measure of the temporal ambient population helps explain the level of crime in blocks during particular time periods. The use of social media data appear promising for testing various implications of routine activities and crime pattern theories, given their explicit spatial and temporal nature. © 2018, © 2018 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - This article seeks to provide an original approach to weapons of mass destruction (WMD)-related illicit trade by drawing on criminology and focusing on the transactional level. Specifically, the article discusses the “rational-choice” model as a way to understand an entity’s involvement in illicit trade, and considers also the limitations of this approach, as well as the role that opportunity plays in an actor’s decision to engage in illicit trade. The article draws the conclusion that the prospects of deterring illicit trade using export controls and related criminal sanctions are limited. Beyond the clear limitations of the rational-choice model, the prospects of deterring illicit WMD trade are limited by the low levels of certainty in export-control enforcement, something that the criminology literature suggests is of greater importance than severity of punishment in deterring crime. Nonproliferation successes are more likely to be found in further efforts to develop tools to address proliferation opportunities, an area that has already seen much work. Efforts to further raise illicit WMD-related trade from the realms of “invisible crime” are necessary, including further conceptual research on illicit trade. © 2018 Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.

AB  - Routine activity theory begins by stating the importance of understanding the spatial component of crime patterns put forth by the Chicago School. In its original formulation, routine activity theory considered only direct-contact predatory violations in which the offender and the victim or target were tangible; subsequent development of the theory, however, has extended it to other violations that include white-collar crime. As developed, routine activity theory was an aggregate-level theory that sought to explain societal changes in crime rates. One aspect of routine activity theory that has gone relatively untested is the concept of capable guardianship, or the lack thereof. Capable guardians have the ability to prevent a crime from occurring, playing an important role in routine activity theory. Reynald has investigated this dimension of routine activity theory through the concept of guardianship in action. In sum, routine activity theory is a simple theory to understand, but contains many complex ideas that are still undergoing refinement. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Avi Brisman, Eamonn Carrabine and Nigel South; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Crime within Arabic countries is significantly different from Western crime in type, frequency, and motivation. For example, motor vehicle theft (MVT) has constituted the largest proportion of property crime incidents in Saudi Arabia (SA) for decades. This is in stark contrast to Western countries where burglary and street theft dominate. Environmental criminology theories, such as routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, have the potential to help to investigate Arabic crime. However, there is no research that has sought to evaluate the validity of these theories within such a different cultural context. This article represents a first step in addressing this substantial research gap, taking MVT within SA as a case study. We evaluate previous MVT studies using an environmental criminology approach with a critical view to applying environmental criminology to an Arabic context. The article identifies a range of key features in SA that are different from typical Western contexts. These differences could limit the appropriateness of existing methodologies used to apply environmental criminology. The study also reveals that the methodologies associated with traditional environmental crime theory need adjusting more generally when working with MVT, not least to account for shifts in the location of opportunities for crime with time. © 2017 Georgia State University.

AB  - Objectives: The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods: Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results: Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions: Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has impacted the world in ways not seen in generations. Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped to study crime in society as never before. We encourage researchers to study specific types of crime, in a temporal fashion (following the stay-at-home orders), and placed-based. The results will reveal not only why, where, when, and to what extent crime changed, but also how to influence future crime reduction. © 2020, Southern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - We argue that a rational choice framework can be used to explain declines in offending from adolescence to young adulthood in two ways. First, subjective expectations of offending can be age graded such that perceptions of rewards decrease and perceptions of risks and costs increase. Second, the marginal (dis)utility of crime may be age graded (e.g., preferences for risks, costs, and rewards). We examine changes in offending from adolescence to young adulthood among a subset of individuals from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 585) and employ a nonlinear decomposition model to partition differences in offending attributable to changing subjective expectations (X) and changing marginal utilities (β). The results indicate that both have direct and independent effects on changes in offending over time. The results of a detailed decomposition on the subjective expectations also indicate that differences exist across the type of incentives. That is, the effect of changing expectations is attributed mainly to changes in perceived rewards (both social and intrinsic). Changing expectations of social costs and risk of arrest from offending have weak effects on changes in criminal behavior, which suggests that they must be accompanied by increases in the weight placed on these expectations to promote appreciable declines in offending. © 2019 American Society of Criminology

AB  - The illicit sale of prescription drugs for enhancing cognitive performance is a criminal act which has hardly been studied although the consumption of these drugs by healthy people has numerous negative individual and social consequences. In this study, we scrutinize the decision to sale those drugs based on assumptions of various criminological rational choice models, self-control theory, social norms, as well as the Model of Frame Selection (MFS) and the Situational Action Theory (SAT). Thereby, we also consider interactions between instrumental incentives, self-control and norms. To investigate decisions regarding the illegal sale of performance enhancing drugs, we used a web-based survey among students at four German universities (N=1,698). Each respondent received randomly one out of 900 vignettes, in each case describing a hypothetical sales situation concerning the illegal and financially rewarding transmission of medications to enhance concentration between students. The descriptions have been randomly varied with respect to the sales profits and the severity of punishments and their respective probabilities. Moreover, the degree of self-control and internalized norms regarding illegal sales have been assessed. The results, that are derived from double hurdle models, show that, especially, internalized norms as well as the severity of punishment reduce the willingness of selling, while low self-control and increasing profits increase this willingness. In addition, a negative interaction effect between low self-control and the severity of punishment shows that a more severe punishment leads to more deterrence when self-control is lower (respectively that with more sever punishments, the impact of self-control decreases). Although the results support the theoretical assumptions only partially, we can show that internalized norms significantly influence the perception of criminal behavior while the benefits of such behavior and self-control seem to operate in a downstream deliberation process. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

AB  - Crime scientists make extensive use of the theories and ideas associated with environmental criminology, specifically situational crime prevention, the rational choice perspective, routine activity theory and crime mapping and concentration, which are described in this chapter. Offenders generally make a conscious decision to offend and ways in which to influence that process are discussed as a means of preventing or reducing crime. Crimes also concentrate in space and time, which makes them more predictable and hence preventable. It is also noted that offenders typically go through a set of preparatory activities prior to the crime itself, which increases the options for intervention and disruption of the planned behaviour. Whilst research has shown that displacement of crime is unlikely to any great extent, it is suggested that ‘thinking like a thief’ can help to reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences, including displacement. © 2024 Gloria Laycock.

AB  - Restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted people’s daily routine activities. Rooted in crime pattern and routine activity theories, this study tests whether the enactment of a Safer-at-Home mandate was associated with changes in the distance between individuals’ home addresses and the locations of where they committed crimes (i.e., residence-to-crime distance). Analyses are based on violent (N = 282), property (N = 1552), and disorder crimes (N = 1092) reported to one police department located in a United States’ Midwest suburb. Multilevel models show that residence-to-crime distances were significantly shorter during the Safer-at-Home order, compared to the pre- and post-Safer-at-Home timeframes, while controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics. Additionally, these relationships varied by crime type. Consistent with the literature, the findings support the argument that individuals tend to offend relatively near their home address. The current findings extend the state of the literature by highlighting how disruptions to daily routine activities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic led to alterations in crime patterns, in which analyses indicated shorter distances between home address and offense locations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Youth misuse of fire is a substantive community concern. Despite evidence which indicates youths account for a significant proportion of all deliberately lit fires within Australia, an absence of up-to-date, contextually specific research means the exact scope and magnitude of youth misuse of fire within Australia remains unknown. Despite research suggesting commonalities exist between youth misuse of fire and juvenile offending more broadly, misuse of fire is rarely explained using criminological theory. In light of this gap, a descriptive analysis of youth misuse of fire within New South Wales was performed. Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory were tested to explain differences in misuse of fire across age groups. Results suggest these environmental theories offer useful frameworks for explaining youth misuse of fire in New South Wales. It is argued that the Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory can be employed to better inform youth misuse of fire policy and prevention efforts. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Purpose: In early 2020, the world faced a rapid life-changing pandemic in the form of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Citywide lockdowns with stay-at-home orders and mass closings quickly became the “new normal.” With these new mandates, routine activity, mental health and financial securities all began to experience major deviations, and it became clear that this could prove to be rather valuable in providing the opportunity for large-scale criminology experiments. This study aims to explore New York City's (NYC) crime patterns during this unique social situation. Specifically, has crime as a whole increased or decreased, and have particular crimes increased or decreased during these stressful fluid times? Design/methodology/approach: The authors briefly review previous crises and worldwide trends but focus on NYC crime as collected by the New York Police Department's statistics unit, “CompStat.” An analysis of 13 crime types from March 30 to July 5 was completed, including percent differences and individual weekly incidence rates in citywide crimes compared to the same time in 2019. Findings: The analysis demonstrated that all crimes analyzed, except for murder and burglary, exhibited a statistically significant difference during COVID-19 conditions compared to the same time the previous year. Grand larceny auto and gun violence crimes significantly increased during COVID-19 weeks, whereas rape, other sex crimes, robbery, felony assault, grand larceny, transit, housing, misdemeanor assault and petit larceny all significantly decreased. Originality/value: Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, this is amongst the first studies to examine trends in NYC crime during pandemic mandates. Expanding our knowledge in these situations can inform natural disaster responses, as well as criminal justice policy and practice to better protect the public in future crises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study examines the impact of four components of a refined routine activity theory model, namely the offenders' motivations, suitable targets, capable guardians, and online routines, on the desistance desires of cyberfraudsters. A largescale self-report survey of 515 cyberfraudsters in Ghana is utilized. The results suggest that traditional criminological theories are still applicable for analyzing cybercrime, especially cyber fraud, even though it is a more sophisticated form of traditional crime with criminals employing various tactics and security experts putting various preventive measures in place. Due to a variety of reasons, cybercriminals continue to target unprotected internet users. The study concludes that depending just on police patrol is insufficient for stopping cyber fraud attempts and that investing in secure systems and solutions is essential for protecting netizens' assets and data from cyber dangers.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Using a 6-year dataset of theft and burglary crime incidents in the Tai Yang Gong (TYG) area (with relatively high crime rates and diversified crime patterns) under a police station’s jurisdiction, we study the seasonality of property crimes in a neighborhood-scale of Beijing, China. First, root mean square error (RMSE) of temperature and the count of crime incidents is adopted to evaluate the crime seasonality. Second, we explore the spatial hotspots of both theft and burglary crimes in the TYG area by kernel density estimation method, and further analyze the data from different hotspots to examine whether variability of seasonality exists across space. The results show that the seasonality of theft is less significant than that of burglary based on the data from the whole TYG area. The results also indicate that the seasonality of property crimes has spatial variability. Specifically, in the residential areas with relocated communities which are the spatial hotspots in the paper’s discussion, the seasonality of burglary is less significant compared with the whole area; similarly, the seasonality of theft in the shopping malls with large supermarkets, another type of spatial hotspots, is less significant than that in the whole TYG area. In a neighborhood-scale, variability on offender’s motivation, target’s presence and guardians across space results in the differences of crime occurrence within different areas, and different areas have different crime patterns such as crime generator and crime attractor, which may not significantly be controlled by the general mechanism of crime seasonality. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime. © 2011 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Behaviour, including criminal behaviour, takes place in lived contexts of embodied action and experience. The way in which abstract models of selfhood efface the individual as a unique, living being is a central aspect of the ‘ethical-other’ debate; if an individual is modelled as abstracted from this ‘living’ context, that individual cannot be properly or meaningfully linked with his or her behaviour, and thus cannot justly be understood as responsible. The dominant rational choice models of criminal identity in legal theory involve at least a partial abstraction of this ‘unethical’ type by prioritising the rational will over the more fluid dimensions of lived reality. From a phenomenological perspective, an approach of ‘restlessness’ is proposed which precludes the development of settled or general abstract categories, and can thus move us closer to an ethical understanding of living individuals on a theoretical level. Although such a move may initially seem to threaten criminal justice with an irrational nihilism, by maintaining awareness of the irreducibility of ‘living’ reality a restless theoretical understanding of moral selfhood may be able to shape or underpin the attribution of responsibility in more practical or substantive contexts without succumbing to meaninglessness. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background: Product counterfeiting is growing in scope, scale, and threat. This includes awareness of deceptive and non-deceptive counterfeiting types. (This paper does not consider copyright or digital piracy, currency counterfeiting, fraudulent documents, or artwork forgery.) In response, many organizations are focusing on product counterfeiting including INTERPOL, International Standards Organization, World Health Organization, World Customs Organization, and the U.S. Department of Justice. The goal of this research is to help brand owners and agencies efficiently select appropriate countermeasures including overt, covert and forensic packaging features, as well as functions of market monitoring, modifying supply chains, enforcement, prosecution and legislation. Methods: To understand how product counterfeiting is perceived, researched, and categorized we reviewed previous work in criminology, packaging science, behavioral science, supply chain management, economics, and business management. Results: We use this collective literature to develop a typology of product counterfeiters, counterfeiting, and offender groups. Conclusions: It is important to understand that anti-counterfeit strategies must be based on understanding the nature of the fraud and the fraudster. Developing a typology is common practice in criminology and is no less important for product counterfeiting. The concepts in this paper provide a typology to help organize a complex set of information. This assists in explaining the opportunity structure of the problem based on the type of counterfeiting, counterfeiter, and offender organization. © 2013 Spink et al.

AB  - Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes. Building on crime pattern theory and combining information from police records and other sources, this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in. In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago. The theoretical implications of these findings and their use for investigative purposes are discussed, and suggestions for future inquiry are made. © 2010 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Objectives: This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders. Methods: Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders’ spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age. Results: Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders. Conclusions: This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Following Youngjohn, Lees-Haley, and Binder's (1999) comment on Johnson and Lesniak-Karpiak's (1997) study that warnings lead to more subtle malingering, researchers have sought to better understand warning effects. However, such studies have been largely atheoretical and may have confounded warning and coaching. This study examined the effect on malingering of a warning that was based on criminological-sociological concepts derived from the rational choice model of deterrence theory. A total of 78 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unwarned simulator group, or one of two warned simulator groups. The warning groups comprised low- and high-level conditions depending on warning intensity. Simulator participants received no coaching about how to fake tests. Outcome variables were scores derived from the Test of Memory Malingering and Wechsler Memory Scale-III. When the rate of malingering was compared across the four groups, a high-level warning effect was found such that warned participants were significantly less likely to exaggerate than unwarned simulators. In an exploratory follow-up analysis, the warned groups were divided into those who reported malingering and those who did not report malingering, and the performance of these groups was compared to that of unwarned simulators and controls. Using this approach, results showed that participants who were deterred from malingering by warning performed no worse than controls. However, on a small number of tests, self-reported malingerers in the low-level warning group appeared less impaired than unwarned simulators. This pattern was not observed in the high-level warning condition. Although cautious interpretation of findings is necessitated by the exploratory nature of some analyses, overall results suggest that using a carefully designed warning may be useful for reducing the rate of malingering. The combination of some noteworthy effect sizes, despite low power and the small size of some groups, suggests that further investigation of the effects of warnings needs to continue to determine their effect more fully. © 2010 Psychology Press.

AB  - Community and problem-oriented policing have shaped the debate over the role of the American police for three decades. In the 1990s, the federal government provided billions of dollars via the COPS program to promote police reform. Dining this time, community and problem-solving practices became more common. Research focusing specifically on whether COPS grants directly resulted in reductions in crime remains mixed. Two archetypes of community policing can be identified, each rooted in a different neighborhood theory of crime: broken windows theory and social disorganization theory. Problem-oriented policing draws on theories of criminal opportunity, such as routine activity and rational choice theory, to direct interventions aimed at altering environmental conditions to reduce crime and disorder. The weight of the empirical evidence is that community and problem-oriented policing can reduce crime and disorder. Many important questions require systematic investigation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opportunities for crime are assumed to be highly localized. Therefore, using streets as units of analysis offers insight into crime patterns that are lost when they are aggregated to the neighborhood level. Previous street-level studies on crime have concentrated on variations in the amount of incidents. According to Crime Pattern Theory, more crime is expected to occur where people's routine activities coincide with suitable targets in poorly guarded circumstances. However, the theory, if extended further, is also applicable to street-level variation in qualitative aspects of crime, such as the relation between offender and victim and the use of weapons. The reason for this is that the routine of everyday life determines spatial concentrations of certain types of people at specific locales, which may determine the way crime is committed in a particular street if the characteristics of its visitors are related to the nature of the crimes committed there. For instance, if a street attracts young people, and young people use guns more often, then gun related violence will be more frequent in that street. This chapter focuses on the volume as well as the nature of violent crime, based on a sample of approximately 600 incidents committed in certain streets in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The results suggest that (a) accessibility and social disorganization increase the number of crimes in a street, (b) co-offending and the relation between offender and victim vary significantly between streets, while weapon use and victim injury do not, and (c) incident characteristics and the street's accessibility play an important role in explaining street-level differences in the relation between victim and offender. The latter finding supports the hypothesis derived from Crime Pattern Theory that the daily functions of streets serve as a selection mechanism for who visits the street and subsequently determine against whom violence is committed in that locality. © 2009 Springer New York.

AB  - Workplace theft accounts for a considerable mass of crime. Economics and management literature addresses the phenomenon exclusively in terms of how to reduce it, while in sociology literature workplace theft is seen as an act of resistance against workplace injustice. In this article the phenomenon is studied using a « routine activity approach » (a « rational choice » approach used in American criminology) on the basis of a survey of actors in the mass marketing and cleaning sectors. Analyzing workplace theft as routine delinquency leads to seeing it less as deviance from a norm than a function of opportunities and surveillance. Principal-agent and agency costs theory is used to understand how it is that anti-theft surveillance involves not prevention/repression logic but rather tolerance/acceptance of what cannot be overseen. As an example of routine delinquency, workplace theft is less likely to scandalize than it is to be instrumentalized by its victims : employers can use theft as grounds for firing the employee. Lastly, the theoretical issues raised by the routine activity approach are critically discussed.

AB  - As time goes by, hazard rate of the society would increase if crime prediction was not implemented. Based on objective factors of offenders and victims characteristics, AHP method can be established to get a quantitative and qualitative analysis on crime prediction. Crime prediction is a strategic and tactical measure for crime prevention. According to AHP analysis, two prediction models of the optimal predictive crime locations are put forward. Standard Deviational Ellipses Model and Key Feature adjusted Spatial Choice Model were formulated to account for the anticipated position with various elements from AHP method. These models could be applied in a computer simulation of situation tests of the series murders. Besides, applying those models in certain real case demonstrates how the models work. Through models comparison, the results are summarized that Key Feature adjusted Spatial Choice Model is more conducive in confirming the guilty place. In conclusion, the suggested models, including detailed criminal map, are easy to implement. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

AB  - Theories about crime have many origins. On the one hand, the ideas at the core of our control theory have been expressed in one fashion or another for centuries; it is a perspective with deep roots in philosophy, psychology, economics, and sociology. This chapter expresses the ideas essential to control theory such that they allow us to better comprehend the facts about crime as we appreciate them today. It exegesis of the theory from the point of view of the nature of crime as revealed by research, rather than the point of view of the offender as dictated by theory. Advances in survey research methods applied to delinquency and crime provided a crucial basis of support for the development of control theory, in both Causes and A General Theory. Economic and rational choice models were coming into fashion and pushing aside the overly-deterministic theories of sociology. © 2011 by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This highly acclaimed criminology text presents an up-to-date review of rational choice theories, including deterrence, shaming and routine activities. It also incorporates current examples of deterrence research regarding domestic violence, drunk driving and capital punishment, and features thought-provoking discussion of the relativity of crime. The authors explore the crime problem, its context, and causes of crime. The organization of the text reflects the fact that the etiology of crime must be at the heart of criminology. It examines contemporary efforts to redefine crime by focusing on family violence, hate crimes, white-collar misconduct with violent consequences, and other forms of human behavior often neglected by criminologists. Extensive discussion of evolving laws are included, and while the prevalence of the scientific method in the field of criminology is highlighted, the impact of ideology on explanations of crime is the cornerstone of the book. Comprehensive introductory text, emphasizing the ideology of crime. Boxes throughout each chapter highlight the text with figures, features and highlights. Each chapter concludes with key terms and concepts, key criminologists, key cases. © 2010 Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterning of arson incidents in a large urban county. Methods: Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space–time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy. Results: Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons. Conclusions: Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this “invisible” Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment. Results may aid in inductive theory building as well as efforts to investigate and prevent arson. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - The frequently predicted relationship between social class and criminal behavior is theoretically vacillating and empirically exiguous. We present an extended rational choice model which integrates the effects of an individual's social status on his or her subjective evaluations of (1) costs, (2) utility, (3) the probability of apprehension, (4) the selective incentives, and (5) the internalization of social norms. We test the model against the offences of shop-lifting and tax-evasion. The data source derived from the German General Social Survey empirically supports the theoretical model. There exists no prevalent relationship between an individual's social status and his or her incentives towards criminal comportment. However, the social status of an individual affects the type of offences committed. The subjectively expected probability of either failing or succeeding in a criminal act takes greater precedence over the fear of retribution or the expected utility. Additionally, internalized norms decrease the probability of committing a crime. Copyright © 2006 Sage Publications.

AB  - Background: There is growing awareness of the increasing scope, scale, and threat of product counterfeiting. Awareness is also growing for the drafting of countermeasures that specifically address deceptive and non-deceptive counterfeiting. This research developed a method and tool to help review, understand, and cluster product-counterfeiting incidents. The intent is to assist brand owners and government agencies select effective countermeasures. Methods: The research builds upon earlier work that developed a typology of product counterfeiters, counterfeiting and offender groups, which is used here to create an original tool to organize and cluster the incidents. While incident data is often confidential or classified, several methods were used to access open-source information in order to apply the tool. First, a set of examples was selected from the literature to demonstrate the tool in principle. Second, in order to examine a complete data set of counterfeiting incidents, the open-source cases of the U.S. National Intellectual Property Rights Center were gathered, reviewed, coded, and analyzed to demonstrate the application of the tool. Results: A Product-Counterfeiting Incident Cluster Tool was developed which is consistent with Routine Activity Theory and Situational Crime Prevention and is intended to identify efficient and effective countermeasures. Conclusions: It is important to establish the type of fraud and the fraudster when developing anti-counterfeit strategies. The insight gained from assessing the specific product-counterfeiting incidents will assist in the profiling and selection of effective industry and government countermeasures. The scientific basis for understanding product counterfeiting is broadened by applying the outlined concepts and describing incidences through the clustering tool. © 2014 Spink et al.

AB  - The study presented here deals with two aspects of the validity of a factorial survey approach (Rossi & Anderson, 1982). This technique is applied to the analysis of crime in everyday life from the perspective of a rational choice approach (Cornish & Clarke, 1986). The situation of "lost letters" (Milgram, Mann, & Harter, 1965) is regarded as an opportunity to display criminal behaviors within the routine activities of everyday life. The study features this situation and focuses on situational influences upon keeping "lost" letters. According to the theoretical framework, the effort and the utility of keeping a "lost" letter are manipulated on the basis of a 2 × 3 design. The study aims at a systematic analysis of the empirical validity and the construct validity of the factorial survey approach. It compares data from a factorial survey (n = 881) with data from a field experiment (n = 395) using an equal study design. The results of the study reveal restrictions of the empirical validity of the factorial survey. Influences of the utility of a "lost" letter are equal across the factorial survey and the field experiment and support the idea of construct validity. In addition to these influences, differences between data collection methods occur which indicate a susceptibility to social desirable responses in a lost letter framework. This result is discussed with regard to the underlying research questions and methodological implications. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - The field of environmental criminology is a staple theoretical framework in contemporary criminological theory. With this book, Martin Andresen presents the first comprehensive and sole-authored textbook on this influential and compelling school of criminological thought. He covers a wide range of topics, including: the origins of environmental criminology; the primary theoretical frameworks, such as routine activity theory, geometric theory of crime, rational choice theory, and the pattern theory of crime; the practical application of environmental criminology; an examination of how theories are operationalized and tested; policy implications for the practice of crime prevention. As well as these "popular topics", Andresen also discusses also a number of topics that are at the leading edge of research within environmental criminology. This text will be ideal for courses on crime prevention, where students are often encouraged to consider policy problems and apply theory to practice. This book offers up environmental criminology as a theoretical framework for making sense of complex neighbourhood problems, meaning that it will be perfect for modules on geography of crime, crime analysis and indeed, environmental criminology. It would also be a good supplement for courses on criminological theory. © 2014 Martin A. Andresen.

AB  - The basis of Situational Crime Prevention, Routine Activity Approach, Environmental Criminology, Opportunity Theory and related perspectives is the notion of rational choice. The preventive techniques are based on the assumption that a rational offender is unlikely to act if the efforts of committing a crime are greater than the expected rewards. This paper seeks to extend the notion of rational choice from the individual to the group and suggests the application of situational prevention to a new dimension-that of large-scale disorder problems such as riots, anti-government demonstrations and confrontational religious celebrations. These disorder problems pose serious challenges since these involve vicious mobs violating prohibitory orders, attacking police personnel and indulging in wanton destruction of property and violence. We argue that even though a mob behaves irrationally and indulges in senseless acts of violence and destruction, the individuals comprising the mob are rational and guided by self-interest in their behavior. Therefore, even in riotous situations, rational choice perspective can be profitably exploited to prevent mayhem. We present several cases of handling major riots and group confrontation from different parts of India. We describe the applicability of several situational techniques to controlling disorder and preventing further escalation of violence. The generalization of Situational Crime Prevention techniques to large-scale order maintenance problems is suggested. © 2007 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

AB  - This paper provides a critical review of two broad categories of social ecological theories of crime, social integration and place-based theories, and their relationships to spatial assessments of crime patterns. Social integration theories emphasize the role of neighborhood disorganization on crime, while place-based theories stress the social interactions within and between places as a source of crime. We provide an analysis of the extent to which these two types of theorizing describe processes and mechanisms that are truly ecologic (identify specific interactions between individuals and their environments) and truly spatial (identify specific movement and interaction patterns of individuals and groups) as they endeavor to explain crime outcomes. We suggest that social integration theories do not provide spatial signatures of sufficient specificity to justify the application of spatial statistical techniques as quantitative arbiters of the theory. On the other hand, place based theories go some way toward addressing these issues because the emphasis is placed on understanding the exact physical and social characteristics of place and the activities that occur around locations as sources of crime. Routine activities and crime potential theories attempt to explain clustering or "hot spots" of crime in ways that give clear spatial dimension by looking at micro-spatial interactions between offenders and targets of crime. These theories have strong ecological implications as well, since they contain specific statements about how people use the space around them and how these patterns of use are related to patterns of criminal activity. We conclude by identifying a set of requirements for successful empirical tests of geospatial theories, including the development of valid measures of key theoretical constructs and the formulation of critical empirical assessments of geospatial hypotheses derived from motivating theory. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to explore the feature and mechanism of a new type of documentary credit fraud that victimizes banks’ issuing letters of credit (L/C), harming neither the importer nor the exporter and seeks to suggest possible measures to tackle it. Design/methodology/approach – This study analyzed 30 cases of documentary credit fraud against banks that were detected by the Korea Customs Service (KCS) and interviewed three key customs investigators to interpret the case reports more accurately and gain a deeper understanding into the mechanisms governing the fraud. This study draws on routine activity theory and crime pattern theory to analyze the opportunity structures of this fraud. Findings – This study found that the importer that engaged in the fraud cases had established a solid business relationship with the exporter and had established trust with the victimized banks; the banks, despite the fact that they had their own risk management systems to screen out unqualified L/C applicants, were defrauded by the offending importers and exporters. Unlike ordinary documentary credit fraud, fraud against banks can be tackled by customs because the offender and the victim typically operate in the same jurisdiction, and this type of fraud often results in trade-based capital flight and money laundering, which is the target of customs enforcement. Research limitations/implications – As this paper is based on case reports of the KCS, it is inappropriate to generalize the findings or to apply the findings to other contexts. Nevertheless, the opportunity structure elaborated upon in the course of this paper may prove useful in devising measures to tackle this type of fraud elsewhere. Originality/value – Documentary credit fraud against banks is relatively unexplored, in particular from criminological perspective. This study can contribute to a refinement of the application of opportunity perspective to white-collar crime. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A theoretical framework focused on crime as a function of situation-specific opportunity emerged in the field of criminology in the latter part of the twentieth century. This framework consists of several overlapping yet distinct theories, including routine activities theory. Though routine activities theory is perhaps most notable, a number of other perspectives emphasizing situational opportunity were developed around the same time as the initial explication of routine activities theory. Today, the overlap in these distinct theoretical statements is widely recognized, and they are thus increasingly treated in an integrative fashion, so as to create a more general crime opportunity perspective. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This book offers a comprehensive introduction to juvenile delinquency by defining and describing juvenile delinquency, examining explanations for delinquent behavior, and considering contemporary efforts to control delinquency through prevention and juvenile justice. The text cultivates an understanding of juvenile delinquency by examining and linking key criminological theories and research. Coverage includes: • the historical origins and transformation of “juvenile delinquency” and juvenile justice; • the nature of delinquency, addressing the extent of delinquent offenses, the social correlates of offending and victimization (age, gender, race and ethnicity, and social class), and the developmental patterns of offending; • theoretical explanations of delinquency, with insights from biosocial criminology, routine activities, rational choice, social control, social learning, social structure, labeling, and critical criminologies; • evidence-based practice in delinquency prevention and contemporary juvenile justice. Fully revised and updated, the new edition incorporates the latest theory and research in the field of juvenile delinquency and provides expanded discussion of contemporary juvenile justice reform, evidence-based practice in delinquency prevention, and disproportionate minority contact throughout the juvenile justice process. This book is essential reading for courses on juvenile delinquency and juvenile justice. The book is supported by a range of compelling pedagogical features. Each chapter includes key terms, learning objectives, an opening case study, box inserts that provide practical application of theory and research, critical thinking questions, suggested reading, useful websites, and a glossary of key terms. A companion website offers an array of resources for students and instructors. For students, this website provides chapter overviews, flashcards of key terms, and useful websites. The instructor site is password protected and offers a complete set of PowerPoint slides and an extensive test bank for each chapter-all prepared by the authors. © 2016 James Burfeind and Dawn Jeglum Bartusch.

AB  - Since the Agent-based simulation tool was introduced into criminology research, most work concentrated on crime theory validation or hypothesis testing, little was contributed to crime spatial pattern replication. In this paper, using street network and subway network as the landscape and proposing a statistic-based instead of predefined human mobility pattern as the individual's routine activity, the spatial distribution of burglary in Beijing is simulated and valid by the actual pattern. The result indicates that the Agent-based modeling method partly detects the crime hotspots and the spatial pattern of crime, and specifically the crime level on the nodes with different accessibility is proved to be identical to the actual one. The study made in this work demonstrates that Agent-based modeling is a potential tool to predict or explain crime pattern in space, and also some further work which aims to improve its validation is discussed in the end of this paper. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Recent studies point to the potential theoretical and practical benefits of focusing police resources on crime hot spots. However, many scholars have noted that such approaches risk displacing crime or disorder to other places where programs are not in place. Although much attention has been paid to the idea of displacement, methodological problems associated with measuring it have often been overlooked. We try to fill these gaps in measurement and understanding of displacement and the related phenomenon of diffusion of crime control benefits. Our main focus is on immediate spatial displacement or diffusion of crime to areas near the targeted sites of an intervention. Do focused crime prevention efforts at places simply result in a movement of offenders to areas nearby targeted sites- do they simply move crime around the corner"? Or, conversely, will a crime prevention effort focusing on specific places lead to improvement in areas nearby - what has come to be termed a diffusion of crime control benefits? Our data are drawn from a controlled study of displacement and diffusion in Jersey City, New Jersey. Two sites with substantial street-level crime and disorder were targeted and carefully monitored during an experimental period. Two neighboring areas were selected as "catchment areas " from which to assess immediate spatial displacement or diffusion. Intensive police interventions were applied to each target site but not to the catchment areas. More than 6,000 20-minute social observations were conducted in the target and catchment areas. They were supplemented by interviews and ethnographic field observations. Our findings indicate that, at least for crime markets involving drugs and prostitution, crime does not simply move around the comer. Indeed, this study supports the position that the most likely outcome of such focused crime prevention efforts is a diffusion of crime control benefits to nearby areas.

AB  - In this study we examine the internal (domestic) sex trafficking of British children using unique data from six major police investigations. This particular type of internal sex trafficking (sometimes known as 'street grooming') has been popularly conceptualised as a highly sophisticated, skilled and well-organised phenomenon. This study shows that this characterisation does not withstand empirical scrutiny. Instead, the routine activities and everyday associations of both offenders and victims are shown to play key roles in facilitating, sustaining and spreading the abuse. While the criminal acts associated with internal child sex trafficking can be atrocious, the people, places and processes involved are shown to be far from exceptional. In this respect, the results may be unsettling: they undermine explanations of an emotive crime that rest on reassuring but ultimately naïve errors of attribution. We argue that it is important, however, that preventative strategies are underpinned not by sensationalised narrative and untested assumptions but by sober and robust assessments of appropriate empirical data. The paper contributes to the theoretical and empirical literature on opportunity theories of crime, on human trafficking and on child sexual abuse/exploitation. While the sample size is not especially large (55 offenders and 43 victims), this study helps to expand a sorely limited knowledge base on a topical threat. It is also distinguished by its hard-to-access data and novel analytical approach. The work is likely to interest a broad and international audience of academics, practitioners and policy makers concerned with crime prevention and child protection. © 2015 Cockbain and Wortley.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders’ awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders’ family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members’ residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders’ children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally. © 2016 American Society of Criminology

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This study investigates target selection scripts of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sex crimes on stranger victims. Using latent class analysis, three target selection scripts were identified based on the victim's activities prior to the crime, each presenting two different tracks: (1) the Home script, which includes the (a) intrusion track and the (b) invited track, (2) the Outdoor script, which includes the (a) noncoercive track and the (b) coercive track, and (3) the Social script, which includes the (a) onsite track and the (b) off-site track. The scripts identified appeared to be used by both sexual aggressors of children and sexual aggressors of adults. In addition, a high proportion of crime switching was found among the identified scripts, with half of the 72 offenders switching scripts at least once. The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - It is no longer necessary to argue for the importance of white-collar crime. Its devastating financial and physical effects are obvious. The task now is to develop better ways to control and prevent white-collar crimes. In this paper, we argue that in order to reduce white-collar crime we must first identify the specific opportunity structures associated with the offenses we wish to prevent. That is, we must identify the features of the settings that allow the crime to occur. Three major theories are reviewed here that can help in this task: routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, and situational crime prevention theory. These theories address how crime opportunities are formed by immediate environments and then discovered and evaluated by potential offenders. We demonstrate that they can also be used to uncover how specific forms of white-collar crimes are committed and help structure analyses of the underlying opportunity structures associated with these offenses. © 2009 Springer New York.

AB  - This is an exploratory investigation into the relevancy of five micro-criminological theories to American college students' self-reported shoplifting (willful concealment) experience. A 146-item Likert-style questionnaire was voluntarily completed by non-randomly selected male and female undergraduates (N=259) at four American universities. From this sample, 166 reported having shoplifted. The survey items were inspired by Akers and Sellers' social learning theory, Sykes and Matza's techniques of neutralization, Gottfredson and Hirschi's selfcontrol theory, Cornish and Clarke's rational choice theory, and Cohen and Felson's routine activity theory. Through factor analysis, 12 factors were developed, two or three for each theory. The results support these theories, but only certain elements of them seemed relevant to our data. We also found that self-control theory and rational choice theory were more relevant to low frequency shoplifters (one or two times), and social learning theory and routine activities theory were more associated with higher frequency shoplifters (three and more-thanthree times). © 2017 International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - This study aims to present an integrated theoretical framework to analyse the effects of different social forces on delinquent behaviour. The main goal of the integrated theory is to explain the links between the sociological explanations of crime and the rational choice model by applying human capital and social capital accumulation processes as the main argument. Various social forces and institutions such as school, family, and peers are examined under the integrated theoretical framework for their potential impacts on two types of deviant behaviour: violent acts and property crime. Evidence from a Montreal sample shows individual decisions to participate in violent acts and property crimes as being influenced by different social forces. Self-reported violent acts are shown to have significant positive relationships with having early market work experiences at a young age, and with knowing delinquent friends and criminal adults. Conversely attending classes at school is shown to have a significant negative relationship with self-reported violent acts. Self-reported participation in property crime, on the other hand, is positively related with having more pocket money, with the presence of delinquent siblings, and with knowing delinquent friends and criminal adults. It is negatively related to living with both biological parents and attending classes at school. The findings provided here further take into account the joint nature of the decision and show that individuals who engage in violent acts are simultaneously more likely to participate in property crimes and vice versa. The study is concluded with the presentation of potential delinquency prevention strategies and policy implications based on the Montreal empirical evidence. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Individuals frequently have routine daily activities that require commuting between several places, such as their home, work, shopping centres and recreational facilities. According to Crime Pattern Theory, offenders most likely commit opportunistic crimes, including serial and violent crimes, within their Activity Space, that is the space that they visit most frequently during the course of their daily routine activities, since they are aware of the opportunities and risks within these spaces. However, others within the social network of an offender can introduce the offender to new opportunities outside of his Activity Space, a phenomenon that Crime Pattern Theory does not address. This paper explores an important and interesting question about social networks: What is the relation between social and spatial distance of actors? We study this question in the context of crime and co-offending networks to better understand the impact of an offender's social network on the Activity Space of the offender. Our experiments on real-life crime data show that there is a strong correlation between social and spatial distance of offenders: offenders who are socially close are also spatially close. © 2012 Authors.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework to mitigate the insider threat from an opportunity-based perspective. Although motive and opportunity are required to commit maleficence, this paper focuses on the concept of opportunity. Opportunity is more tangible than motive, hence it is more pragmatic to reflect on opportunity-reducing measures. Opportunity theories from the field of criminology are considered to this end. The derived framework highlights several areas of research and may assist organisations in designing controls that are situationally appropriate to mitigate insider threat. Current information security countermeasures are not designed from an opportunity-reducing perspective. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper examines the criminological underpinnings of song lyrics in the collection of Johnny Cash. We have examined the lyrics of 60 songs performed by Johnny Cash (although not necessarily written by Cash) that reflect on issues including crime, prison, chain gangs, the death penalty, and redemption. Using a content analysis of these lyrics, we examined Cash's criminological view of crime and punishment. While not versed in criminological theory, Cash nonetheless sang eloquently of a rational choice model of crime in which offenders accepted responsibility for their acts, punishment was justified, and yet incarceration should be humane and rehabilitative. © 2010 School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail-crime pattern and social disorganization theory-and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder. © 2013 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - There is a danger in thinking that once security measures have been implemented, there will never be a crime again or unwanted activity in the same area; however, crime may or may not occur. This chapter provides an overview of the main existing environmental crime control theories and explains the theory application aids in informed crime control decisions. Environmental crime practitioners focus their attention and energies on locations of potential criminal activity and seek to explain them in terms of environmental influences. From these explanations they derive rules to be made about emerging crime problems and that ultimately inform the development of strategies that might be employed to prevent crime. Various environmental crime control theories are rationale choice theory, displacement of crime, diffusion of benefits, routine activity theory, crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED), and defensible space theory. CPTED, probably the most well known of the environmental crime control theories has three key concepts; use of natural surveillance, use of natural access control, and territorial behavior. The defensible space theory revolves around the public housing environment and seeks to reduce crime through the use of natural surveillance, natural access control, and territorial concern. The theories, rational choice, routine activities, CPTED, and defensible space techniques, comprise an important basis for explaining some of the root causes of certain crimes that may occur repeatedly in specific locations. However, a detailed study of the criminal area with the accompanying rationale should reduce the criminal opportunity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter pays homage to the history that has become popularly known as the classical school of criminology. It begins with a brief discussion of the early philosophical history of classical criminology and its origins not so much in Beccaria, but in both the French Encyclopedists and the English moral philosophers and free thinkers. The bulk of attention will be devoted to the reappearance of classical theory assumptions since the late 1960s in the form of deterrence, routine activities, and rational choice theory. The most general of the decision-based theories is taken, with rational choice theory with deterrence and routine activities theories as more specific variations of rational choice theory. Regardless of any subtle differences, all these theories share the common assumption that offending is a matter of choice based upon the anticipated costs and benefits of the action, and so all are premised on classical criminology. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime. © 2015 by the American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is a globally applied strategy for dealing with crime and the fear of crime by designing out elements in the environment that provide opportunities for criminal events to occur. With a developmental history stretching back to the early 1960s in the United States, CPTED has changed from a limited approach based on environmental determinism to one that acknowledges the role of social factors in crime. While its limitations stem from a lack of conceptual and definitional clarity, it has nevertheless proved to be a popular approach to crime prevention. However, its greatest benefit lies in being part of a wider strategy of dealing with crime in communities. © 2012 Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..

AB  - This paper proposes a placement model for closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to effectively monitor criminal activity on pedestrian streets in student safety zones in South Korea. Although pedestrian streets around schools are potential crime sites, the legal management of and supervisory responsibility for these areas are ill-defined. The increasing demand for public supervision in student safety zones requires the effective control of high-cost CCTV systems. The rational choice perspective and routine activity approach can be used to explain attackers' preferences for criminal activities and the accompanying situational characteristics. Surveillance conditions differ depending on the pedestrian flow and immediate environment. The spatial properties derived from the pedestrian street network affect pedestrian flow. In addition, visibility of the physical environment affects natural surveillance and mechanical surveillance. Quantitative research is presented on the needs for surveillance considering these properties, and a placement model for public CCTV cameras is proposed that uses a genetic algorithm. Following an analysis of surveillance conditions, the model provides information describing the placement and mechanical operation of surveillance cameras. CCTV cameras are routinely installed in student safety zones; the proposed model should contribute to the effective planning and installation of these cameras. © 2016, Architectural Institute of Japan.

AB  - Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted. Using data in 3337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before. This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent. Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - While a number of IS security researchers consider the threat posed by employees who perpetrate computer crime, there is currently a lack of insight into how the offender interacts with the criminal context both prior to and during commission. A greater understanding of this relationship may complement existing security practices by possibly highlighting new areas for safeguard implementation. To help facilitate a greater understanding of the offender/environment dynamic, this paper, therefore, aims to assess the feasibility of applying three criminological theories to the IS security context. Rather than focusing on why people become criminals, these theories entitled routine activity theory, environmental criminology and the rational choice perspective, focus on the criminal act. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on an account of the Barings Bank collapse, events highlighted in the case study are used to assess whether concepts central to the theories are supported by the data. Findings - Analysis indicates support for the concepts central to environmental criminology and the rational choice perspective. While case study evidence supports two of the concepts advanced by routine activity theory, as a whole the theory is found wanting, as the "guardianship" and "handled offender" concepts appear to lack the necessary sophistication to theoretically accommodate and explain supervisory and control failings cited in the case study. Research limitations/implications - While future research could encompass continued application of the theories to further assess their suitability for the IS domain, consideration could also be given to the application of the preventive tools and methods which have been developed in tandem with the three criminological approaches. Another stream of future research may involve the application of the theories in conjunction with existing security practices. Practical implications - Greater knowledge of the offender/context dynamic may feasibly enhance existing security practices by possibly highlighting new areas for safeguard implementation. Originality/value - From an IS security perspective, there is currently a lack of insight into the offender/context dynamic. The paper presents a group of criminological theories, which have previously not been considered for application in the IS context. The theories may feasibly throw light on the behaviour of offenders in the criminal context, both prior to and during commission. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - This chapter discusses the application of dual-process and dual-system models to offender decision making. It is argued that these models offer a more accurate account of the decision process than the traditional choice models in criminology, such as rational choice and deterrence models, and can overcome their various limitations. Specific attention is devoted to the hot/cool perspective of criminal decision making, which takes the dual-process hypothesis as a point of departure. This model is rooted in the idea that both “cool” cognition and “hot” affect, or thinking and feeling, guide behavior and that understanding their interaction is fundamental for understanding how people make criminal choices. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - Environmental criminology is a term that encompasses a range of overlapping perspectives. At its core, the many strands of environmental criminology are bound by a common focus on the role that the immediate environment plays in the performance of crime, and a conviction that careful analyses of these environmental influences are the key to the effective investigation, control, and prevention of crime. This new edition brings together leading theorists and practitioners in the field to provide a comprehensive, integrative coverage of the field of environmental criminology and crime analysis. This book is divided into three sequential parts: • Understanding the crime event explores routine activity approach, crime pattern theory, the rational choice perspective, and situational precipitators of crime. • Analysing crime patterns discusses crime mapping, offender mobility, repeat victimisation, geographic profiling, and crime scripts. • Preventing and controlling crime covers topics including problem oriented policing, situational crime prevention, and environmental design. Fully updated and including new chapters on crime scripts and offender mobility, a scene-setting introductory overview, and critical thinking questions at the end of each chapter, this text is an essential and comprehensive resource for practitioners and students taking courses on environmental criminology, crime analysis, and crime prevention. © 2017 Richard Wortley and Michael Townsley.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives—crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014

AB  - Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is a globally applied strategy for dealing with crime and the fear of crime by designing out elements in the environment that provide opportunities for criminal events to occur. With a developmental history stretching back to the early 1960s in the United States, CPTED has changed from a limited approach based on environmental determinism to one that acknowledges the role of social factors in crime. While its limitations stem from a lack of conceptual and definitional clarity, it has nevertheless proved to be a popular approach to crime prevention. However, its greatest benefit lies in being part of a wider strategy of dealing with crime in communities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental criminology theory has established that crime is non-random across time and space, instead clustering in specific, predictable ways. This has resulted in the development of theories that have helped generate a suite of highly effective, targeted crime prevention tools. Although access to high-quality temporal and spatial fire event data has improved in recent decades, the nexus between spatial/temporal clustering, theory, and targeted fire prevention remains largely unexplored. To address this, the current paper compares the temporal and spatial distributions of residential structure fire and residential burglary within a North American city over a three year period. This analysis reveals (a) overlapping spatial clustering for these two incident types, and (b) distinct temporal patterns; all of which can be explained by the logic underpinning environmental criminology theory. The extrapolation of these findings to targeted fire prevention is discussed with respect to the opportunity this presents for the fire service. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study seeks evidence that a newly introduced light rail system has altered the crime opportunity structure in a north-eastern United States city. New public transport systems may affect crime opportunities in their constituent neighborhoods, either by introducing non-local offenders to previously unexplored 'hunting grounds', or by delivering new opportunities to local offenders already active in station neighborhoods. Chi-square analyses of arrest data connected to offenses committed in station areas before and after service introduction found little evidence that the new system had either introduced non-local offenders to its constituent neighborhoods or contributed with new targets to local offenders. These findings are important to transport planners and crime scientists alike, as this evidence may help to both reframe public discourse about potential transport system effects on local crime and aid law enforcement in crafting crime prevention strategies. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigates whether individual- and area-level factors explain variation in the residence-to-crime distances (RC distance) for 10 offense types.Methods: Five years of police data from Dallas, Texas, are analyzed using multilevel models (hierarchical-linear/multi-level modeling).Results: Residence-to-crime distances for Dallas offenders varied notably across offense types. Although several area characteristics such as residential instability and concentrated immigration were associated with the overall variance in RC distance, neither these nor the individual-level characteristics used in our models explained the offense-type variance in the RC distance.Conclusions: Although individual- and neighborhood-level factors did not explain substantial variation in RC distance across the various offenses, neighborhood-level factors explained a significant portion of neighborhood-level variance. Other finding included a curvilinear effect of age on RC distance. The salience of these findings and their implications for future research and offender travel theory are discussed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This article aims to review empirical research on residential burglary over the last three to four decades and relate these findings to a model of 'dysfunctional expertise' (Nee & Ward, this issue) that is rooted in mainstream cognitive psychology. It begins with a description of the elements of expertise that might fit in to this model and then traces the offender's decision-chain, using the model as an explanatory tool. Studies have shed light on: the automatic and habitual appraisal of the criminogenic environment during the daily, routine activities of the burglar and his journey to crime; accruing situational awareness and automatic recognition of cues signifying vulnerable properties during target selection; and speedy deployment of offending scripts based on tried and tested methods when entering and carrying out the crime. The review highlights how little is known about decisions, reflections and emotions after the crime. Aspects of the model that require development through further research, as well as the value of using the model for crime prevention purposes, are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. © 2009 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Objectives: The utility of configural behavior settings is explored as an alternative unit of analysis for place-based criminological research. Four research questions are addressed: (1)How do robberies cluster within certain behavior settings? (2) How are conclusions about robbery’s behavior settings influenced by the distance interval used to measure the proximate environment? (3) Are dominant behavior settings homogeneous across patrol districts? and (4) Is there temporal variability among dominant behavior settings? Method: Conjunctive analysis of case configurations is used to construct configural behavior settings around 453 robbery locations in Henderson, Nevada, between 2007 and 2009. Results: The major findings of this study are that (1) the majority of personal robberies occur within a small number of dominant configural behavior settings and (2) the composition of behavior settings and the proportion of incidents for which they account varies by the distance interval used to measure the proximate environment, patrol district, and time of day. Conclusions: Configural behavior settings provide an alternative unit of analysis that can be used in future place-based research to improve our understanding of criminogenic microenvironments. Replication of this study in other cities that vary in urban design would further demonstrate the merits of this approach. © The Author(s) 2015

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Since its original publication, routine activity theory has proven most instructive for understanding temporal patterns in crime. The most prominent of the temporal crime patterns investigated is seasonality: Crime (most often assault) increases during the summer months and decreases once routine activities are less often outside. Despite the rather widespread literature on the seasonality of crime, there is very little research investigating temporal patterns of crime at shorter time intervals such as within the week or even within the day. This paper contributes to this literature through a spatial-temporal analysis of crime patterns for different days of the week. It is found that temporal patterns are present for different days of the week (more crime on weekends, as would be expected) and there is a spatial component to that temporal change. Specifically, aside from robbery and sexual assault at the micro-spatial unit of analysis (street segments) the spatial patterns of crime changed. With regard to the spatial pattern changes, we found that assaults and theft from vehicle had their spatial patterns change in predictable ways on Saturdays: Assaults increased in the bar district and theft from vehicles increased in the downtown and recreational car park areas. © 2015 Andresen and Malleson.

AB  - Gated communities have experienced phenomenal growth worldwide due in part to increasing fear of urban crime and violence. However, very little is known about the effect of gating a neighborhood on rates of criminal victimization. In this article, we fill this gap by examining the relationship between residential burglary and gated communities in Tshwane, South Africa. South Africa has over 26,000 registered gated communities and high levels of violent and property crime, making it a suitable geographical focus area for research of this nature. Using variables informed by routine activities theory, we ran a series of regression models to assess the independent effect of gating on rates of day and night time burglary. The findings indicate that gated neighborhoods have a significant positive association with burglary rates in both day and night time models, suggesting that residing in a gated community actually increases one's risk of burglary victimization. Possible explanations for these unexpected findings are discussed in the context of South Africa's unique sociopolitical past. © 2013 Georgia State University.

AB  - This paper presents a method for analyzing patterns of criminal activity that occur in space and time. The method uses the fuzzy C-means algorithm to cluster criminal events in space. In addition, a cluster reorganization algorithm is included to preserve the order of fuzzy partitions from one time step analysis to another. Order preservation is possible since crime forms relatively stable patterns due to the fixed shape of urban spaces and routine activities of people. The method provides a novel way to analyze criminal directionality, since it generates time series from clustering. A sample database of robberies in San Francisco, USA, is used to test the algorithm. Results show that criminal patterns might be tracked in a simple way. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The article builds on previous work by Roman and colleagues in order to specify the potential causes for increased incidents of violent assault in areas featuring a high number of prosocial institutions (i.e., schools, recreation centers). Utilizing aspects of routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, the argument is presented that both poverty and youth population will have a conditioning impact on the relationship between the presence of prosocial places and incidence of violent assault. Least squares regression was utilized in order to show that such institutions can serve as generators for offending and/or victimization, and that their location in lower income areas may magnify the problem. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Crime is unevenly distributed in space. This chapter discusses the uneven spatial patterns in crime from an offender decision-making perspective. It describes the main theoretical perspectives in environmental criminology (the rational choice perspective, routine activity approach, and crime pattern theory) and reviews the empirical research with an emphasis on studies that have used a discrete spatial choice framework for analyzing individual crime location choices. The strength of the discrete spatial choice framework, several of its assumptions, and its link with random utility maximization theory are discussed. The chapter concludes with several challenges for future crime location choice research, including challenges regarding temporal aspects of criminal decision making, planned versus opportunistic crimes, and solved versus unsolved crimes. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - In this paper, we report some lessons learned on conducting empirical studies in cybersecurity. We first describe our attempts to obtain and process security data collected by other organizations. We then list the security data available for research at the University of Maryland and the research we have conducted using these data. Facing critiques - mainly on the lack of generalizability - we describe how we decided to collaborate with social scientists, especially criminologists, to apply social science theories to cybersecurity. Two ongoing research threads are then described to illustrate the feasibility of introducing some science to cybersecurity through the application of criminological theories. Copyright © 2012 ACM.

AB  - Crime and its spatial dynamics have a long history dating back to the early 1800s in France. In this article, I review four subfields of research within spatial criminology that explicitly consider crime and its spatial dynamics: spatially referenced crime rates, location quotients, geographic profiling, and crime and place. The latest research from these subfields are reviewed with some discussion of their future directions in understanding spatial dynamics and crime. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter, and indeed the entire book, focuses on some old topics, namely legal consciousness, legal decision making, and the interaction between the two. One can date the issue back at least to the ideas and writings of the famous (or infamous) psychologist Hugo Münsterberg (1908), who argued, perhaps somewhat unconvincingly at the time, that behavioral science, especially psychology, is relevant to law and legal analysis. Munsterberg was optimistic, and perhaps even prophetic, in his view that behavioral science and especially psychology would one day inform the courts on a number of critical issues. In the years following Munsterberg's attempt to infuse behavioral science into the law, there have been numerous scholarly efforts to study judicial decisions, legislative policy, jury decisions, decisions to litigate, outcomes of mediation, eyewitness judgments, and many other behaviors that are the outcome of decision-making processes in the service of the law. The current chapter and the specific theme of this book stem directly from a more recent scholarly debate. In 1985, the Nebraska Symposium on Motivation under the editorial directorship of Professor Gary Melton, at the time the director of the Law and Psychology program at UNL, took seriously the task of examining the intersection of everyday decision making and the law (c.f. Melton & Saks, 1985). Melton and Saks (1985) broke from tradition to argue that the most important contribution that psychology could make to the law was not to be found in its contribution to civil or criminal litigation. Instead, they saw the greatest potential for the social sciences in investigating how the law influences, and is influenced by, everyday behavior of people in the environments (outside of court) in which they live, work, and play. In other words, Melton and Sacks argued that psychology can make its mark in the contexts in which law influences our everyday behavior, namely in the homes, schools, universities, businesses, and communities where people interact under the guidance (or perhaps misguidance) of the rules of law as they understand them to be. The law in everyday life approach to psycholegal scholarship (Melton, 1988, 1990; Melton & Saks, 1985; Wiener, 1990, 1993; Wiener & Hurt, 1997, 1999, 2000) acknowledges the successes of psychologists in studying and sometimes even influencing the processes and procedures of the law. For example, psychologists have devoted considerable effort toward understanding how the police are able (or not able) to help witnesses identify guilty defendants at crime scenes. Indeed, they have been very successful at developing a viable theory of eyewitness identification from the encoding of information at the scene of the crime through selecting individuals from mug shots and lineups that the police construct on the scene or at the local police station. Indeed, in 1998 a lead journal in the field of psychology and law (Law and Human Behavior) published a "white paper" that made some helpful and very specific suggestions about how police should construct lineups to avoid biased results, especially type I errors (i.e., identifying innocent suspects as the perpetrators of criminal acts) (Wells et al., 1998). These recommendations flowed directly from years of empirical research carefully describing and explaining eyewitness behavior (Wells et al., 1998). It is a tribute to the success of experimental psychology that this "white paper" became the basis for a set of guidelines that the United States Department of Justice adopted in 1999 (Technical Working Group, 1999). The success of eyewitness researchers depended, and continues to depend heavily, on the use of simulation experiments to study the cognitive parameters of people as they encode, store, recognize, and recall the events to which they were exposed at simulated scenes of criminal or civil investigations. Experimental psychologists have devoted an equal amount of effort to the study of how jurors and juries reach decisions of culpability and liability in criminal and civil trials. Early research focused on juror verdicts in criminal cases, emphasizing theoretical models of social and cognitive psychology (Devine, Clayton, Dunford, Seying, & Pryce, 2001). These methodologies sometimes paid little attention to the ecological structure of juries or jury trials. Instead, they focused on the decisions and judgment processes of individuals as they evaluated evidence of criminal charges (for the most part) and then reached attributions of responsibility and sometimes guilt. More recent investigators (c.f. Devine et al., 2001) have turned their attention to the processes and procedures of determining liability in civil cases (Bornstein, 2004; Bornstein, Rung, & Miller, 2002; Diamond, Saks, & Landsman, 1998; Hans, Hannaford, & Munsterman, 1999; Hastie, Schkade, & Payne, 1998; Kovera & Cass, 2002), sentencing in criminal cases (especially capital murder) (Lynch & Haney, 2000; Wiener et al., 1998; Wiener, Pritchard, & Weston, 1995; Wiener, Rogers, Winter, et al., 2004), and most recently to assessing damages in civil litigation (see Greene & Bornstein, 2003 for a review). There is an impressive body of work (although not always with consistent results) that litigators, trial consultants, and courts can rely on to estimate the effects of legal and extralegal factors on the outcomes of juror, if not jury, judgments and decisions. As in the case with eyewitness researchers, the success of experimental psychologists in the area of juror and jury decision-making relies on simulated mock jury paradigms to isolate the mechanisms that guide and eventually determine the judgments that people make when they are asked to evaluate trial-like evidence to reach culpability, sentencing, liability, and damage judgments. The purpose of this chapter and the book as a whole is to push the academic envelope to broaden the efforts of our admittedly post-positivist2 approach to psycholegal investigation. The major thesis of this chapter is that we can use the post-postivist model of research and thinking about research to examine the effects of law in everyday behavior, and that the best way to do that is to adopt a model of legal decision-making that intertwines the law and behavioral science approach to legal analysis. While a decision-making approach makes use of simulated research as do its older cousins in eyewitness identification and jury research, it does so with an eye open to, and constrained by, the context in which people make legal decisions. In some ways, the behavioral science and law program owes a great deal to the law and economics movement because the former often reacts, either explicitly or implicitly, to study chinks in the armor of the rational choice model, which is, of course, the central metaphor in the law and economics movement. It is not important whether law and social science as legislative fact, as empirical research, or as a more general theory of law sees itself as an alternative to the law and economics movement, or whether it plays a more complementary role, showing how psychology, sociology, and anthropology can go beyond describing and even explaining behavior "at the margins." What is important is that law and social science as analytic tools can add significantly to the theory of rational choice, supplementing the tenets of the theory of the rational actor moving beyond formal rules of logic. While some psychology researchers challenge the adequacy of the "theory of rational choice" as the best descriptor of human decision-making in the law, they do not challenge the logic symmetry of the rational actor model. In other words, all decision makers who wish to maximize their own self-interest make judgments and decisions in accordance with the rules of formal logic and probability. Like those who have taken to task the rational choice model, we acknowledge its indisputable claim on how people can make decisions to maximize their gains and minimize their losses. That seems to be true by definition. However, we see another contribution and suggest that the theory of rational choice offers an important baseline for understanding both how people really do make legal decisions, and how the law would have them make those decisions. In the end, the rational choice model becomes a kind of decision baseline against which we can measure actual and normative decisions. We can learn a great deal by using the rational choice model to study the parameters of decisions that are, at least in part, determined from prohibitions, encouragements, and, in some cases, requirements in the law. We begin with a description of the law and economics approach, focusing on its central metaphor, the theory of rational action. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally, research on sex offenders focused on intrinsic individual factors, such as motivation, psychological processes, cognitive distortions, among others. Over the past few years, a shift in focus has occurred. Offender-victim dynamics, as well as contextual and situational aspects of the criminal event are starting to be examined by researchers, in an effort to better understand the criminal event as a whole (law, offender, victim and environment). Environmental Criminology, in particular, has greatly contributed to this change in focus, by emphasizing the role of contextual and environmental aspects in criminal events. This chapter aims at summing up the research on sex offenders' hunting behavior, modus operandi and geographic decision-making, from an Environmental Criminology perspective. For this purpose, not only are some of the most important contributions to the field reviewed, but also new and previously unpublished data are introduced. Aspects such as offender type, architectural and urban features, routine activities, rational choice and their influence on sex offenders' hunting behavior, modus operandi and geographic decision-making are examined and discussed. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This article is divided into five sections. Section I provides an overview of community and problem-oriented policing, highlighting the key of elements of the two approaches. Section II discusses the history of the American police, with an emphasis on the antecedents and outcomes associated with prior reform efforts. Section III describes the federal government's involvement in community and problem-oriented policing via the COPS program, and reviews the research assessing the impact of the program on crime rates is reviewed. Section IV focuses on the theoretical frameworks that guide community and problem-oriented policing interventions, and extant empirical research. Community policing is rooted in two theories of neighborhood crime (i.e., broken windows and social disorganization), whereas problem-oriented policing is often couched in theories of criminal opportunity (i.e., rational choice and routine activity). Section V concludes with a discussion specifying priorities for future research. © 2011 by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Criminal gangs, insurgent groups, and terror networks demonstrate observable preferences in selecting the sites where they commit their crimes. Accordingly, police departments, military organizations, and intelligence agencies seek to learn these preferences and identify locations with a high probability of experiencing the particular event of interest in the near future. Often, such agencies are keen not just to predict the spatial pattern of future events but even more importantly to conduct threat assessments of particular criminal gangs or insurgent groups. These threat assessments include identifying where each of the various groups presents the greatest threat to the community, what the most likely targets are for each criminal group, what makes one location more likely to experience an attack than another, and how to most efficiently allocate resources to address the specific threats to the community. Previous research has demonstrated that applying multivariate prediction models to relate features in an area to the occurrence of crimes offers an improvement in predictive performance over traditional methods of hot-spot analysis. This paper introduces the application of multilevel modeling to these multivariate spatial choice models, demonstrating that it is possible to significantly improve the predictive performance of the spatial choice models for individual groups and leverage that information to provide improved threat assessments of the criminal elements in a given geographic area. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The US power grid has been identified by security experts as a prime target for terrorist-based and state-sponsored cyber attacks. In addition to downing the grid, cyber attacks can also destroy and manipulate data systems, obtain sensitive intellectual property and steal trade secrets. Existing research has addressed the technical factors, such as vulnerabilities and poor intrusion detection systems, which lead to cyber attacks. However, it remains silent on the human factors in the cyber attack equation. This study uses a criminological framework, specifically Routine Activities Theory and Rational Choice Perspective to capture intelligent adversaries who plan and execute attacks based on their analysis of target suitability and guardianship efficacy. It uses a two-step methodology to identify adversary-, target-, and guardianship-specific factors that collectively impact decision-making processes. First, a document analysis of existing literature reveals nine factors (PARE RISKS) that influence adversarial decision-making: Prevention measures, Attacks and Alliances, Results, Ease of Access, Response and Recovery, Interconnectedness and Interdependencies, Security Testing, Assessments and Audits, Knowledge, Skills, Research and Development, and System Weaknesses. Second, surveys and interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 with various hackers, penetration testers, and power grid representatives helps validate and refine the PARE RISKS framework. This study identifies (i) adversary-specific factors as resources (skills, money, and time), and research (targets and techniques); (ii) target-specific factors as accessibility (electronic and physical) and weaknesses (outdated architecture and inadequate testing/updates); and (iii) guardian-specific factors as prevention (quality of prevention and intrusion detection measures). It argues that altering each of these three elements of Routine Activities Theory can impact adversarial decisionmaking, which may help reduce the likelihood of power grid cyber attacks.

AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The empirical observation that a small number of micro places generate the bulk of urban crime problems has become a criminological axiom. Explanations for the persistence of high-crime places have traditionally drawn upon opportunity theories of crime. In a new book, Weisburd, Groff, and Yang suggest that social disorganization could also be a powerful explanation for the uneven distribution of crime within neighborhoods. In this article, we explain briefly why their empirical work considerably sharpens knowledge about crime concentrations in the city. We then offer a critique of their conclusions concerning the relative contributions of social and situational variables in explaining crime hot spots and the preventive implications they draw from these findings. Finally, we suggest new research that could invigorate the debate on the formation and persistence of high-crime places and could support interventions that seek to change the situational precipitators and facilitators of crime. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Numerous studies by Tyler and colleagues, as well as other scholars, support a normative, process model to account for variation in the public's cooperation with police in the USA and other developed nations. However, a recent study in Ghana suggests that in developing countries fraught with high levels of violent crime and corruption, cooperation may instead be accounted for by a utilitarian, rational-choice model. Our study examines whether public cooperation with police in the developing nation of Trinidad and Tobago is associated with the process model or rational-choice model. Using in-person structured interviews with residents, we examined whether victims' decisions to report to police were related to individuals' perceptions about police effectiveness or police legitimacy. We found support for the process model. We discuss possible explanations for the divergence with Tankebe's research in Ghana and suggest avenues for future research. © 2013 Copyright Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - When comparing amounts of crime over time, Criminologists frequently calculate 'crime rates' by taking crime totals for a particular community and dividing them by the population size. Population size is typically based on census data for a particular geographical area. Although the census provides a gross estimate of the population living in a given area, it fails to account for the potentially large ambient populations travelling through it. As suggested by Routine Activity and Crime Pattern theory as well as recent work by Andresen, using an inappropriate denominator for these rates can have a profound impact on the identification of crime hotspots and in some instances may grossly misrepresent the extent of specific crime problems. In this chapter we employ geo-coded police data as well as LandScan, a global population database, to illustrate how, by using ambient population as an alternative denominator, crime rates and identified hotspots for a variety of crime types at the same location, can vary considerably from those using traditional census-based crime data. We show how differences depend not only on the crime examined and time of day but also on the specific activities occurring in the area on any given day such as the ambient population increase associated with football match attendance. The resultant implications for law enforcement strategy and resource deployment are discussed. Basic guidelines for making informed decisions regarding which denominator is appropriate for a given crime problem or local area are suggested. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Computer offences and crimes against corporate computer systems have increasingly become a major challenge to information security management in the Internet-enabled global economy and society. In this study, we attempt to develop a theoretical model that integrates three main stream criminology theories, i.e., general deterrence, rational choice, and individual propensity. We submit that, while the main decision process leading to an offensive act may be explained by the rational choice theory, selfcontrol and deterrence factors could significantly alter the risk-benefit calculus assumed in the rational choice model. Using data collected from employees in multiple organizations, we tested our model using structural equation modelling techniques. We found that the perceived benefits of offensive acts dominate the rational calculus in individuals, and that the low self-control significantly impacts the perceived benefits and risks, thus playing a major role in the computer offences perpetrated by individuals in organizational settings. In addition, we found that deterrence only has limited impact on the offensive intentions through increased perceived risks. By integrating multiple theories into one seamless model, we hope to provide better understanding of computer offences and deeper insights for improving information security management practices.

AB  - This highly acclaimed criminology text presents an up-to-date review of rational choice theories, including deterrence, shaming, and routine activities. It also incorporates current examples of deterrence research regarding domestic violence, drunk driving, and capital punishment, and features thought-provoking discussion of the relativity of crime. The authors explore the crime problem, its context, and causes of crime. The organization of the text reflects the fact that the etiology of crime must be at the heart of criminology. It examines contemporary efforts to redefine crime by focusing on family violence, hate crimes, white-collar misconduct with violent consequences, and other forms of human behavior often neglected by criminologists. Extensive discussion of evolving laws is included, and while the prevalence of the scientific method in the field of criminology is highlighted, the impact of ideology on explanations of crime is the cornerstone of the book. © 1993, 1998 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper analyzes the spatial patterns of motor vehicle theft crimes in Mexico City. The largest metropolitan áreas in Latin-America are witnessing a sharp escalation of urban violence and the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is not the exception. In the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City the motor vehicle theft is one of the crimes that have higher arrest and criminal warrants with 40 336 in average during the 1995 to 2007 period. In 2010 motors vehicle theft reached 44 446 criminal warrants, representing the 39% of all criminal warrants in the city. However, such crime does not show a homogenous spatial pattern but shows a high spatial concentration in some delegations of Mexico City such as Benito Juárez, Coyoacán and Cuauhtémoc. In this context, the research question is: Does exists spatial relationship between concentration of motor vehicle theft and environmental factors?. The theoretical background is provided by the social disorganization theory, the routine activities and crime patterns. Both theories explain criminal spatial variation as responses to environmental conditions. The causal mechanism underlying both theories is that individuals make decisions based on the aggregated behavior around them. Individuals are constantly exposed to social stimuli, and they make use of the information derived from the environment (e.g. behavioral contagion).The data includes arrests and criminal warrants of motor vehicle theft provided by the General Office of Justice of the Federal District (PGJDF, 2010) and the rest of socioeconomic variables were provided by the Housing and Population Census, 2010, all of them at census tract level. The methodology used includes regional analysis techniques such as location quotient, múltiple regression analysis and exploratory spatial data analysis ESDA in specific the Morán Indice. This is performed within reasonable limits of data reliability, sampling error, and in disconnection from theoretical postulates. The results of the múltiple regression identify variables such as none residential land use, population density, female-headed households, single and concentration of young population influence motor vehicle theft crimes. These findings allow us to design public security polices focused in places where could implement programs oriented to the situational prevention of the crime and the social prevention of crime. Besides, the results provide findings for urban planning and social development policies with police strategies. © 2016 Universidad Nacional Autonóma de México.

AB  - In daylight, burglars minimized the risks of being spotted by selecting "up-market" targets with better front cover and low occupancy that reflected the occupants' higher employment levels. After dark, townhouses with less cover were popular despite victims, fewer of whom were employed, raising more alerts. Evidence indicates consistency with routine activity theory, and target strategies appear rational, though shaped by differences in risks and offenders. Lifestyles and routine activities of victims, coupled with daylight and darkness changes, created burglary opportunities. Distinctive daylight and darkness strategies proved attractive to certain types of offenders, so that housing morphology, victims, their lifestyle, risks, rewards and burglar characteristics were distinctively aligned, providing the framework for target and area selection. Theories need to incorporate contrasts in daylight-darkness and housing morphologies, and relate to offender diversity.

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available." © SAGE Publications 2012.

AB  - Criminological research on fear of crime primarily has been based on, and supportive of, an opportunity framework. The current research tests an expanded risk-assessment model of fear, which is rooted in an opportunity framework, by incorporating a measure of delinquent lifestyle, which is a known risk factor for victimization, using a sample of youth aged 10-16 years. The findings from longitudinal structural equation models do not support the applicability of a risk-assessment model of fear in adolescence. Namely, although increased involvement in a delinquent lifestyle is associated strongly with an increase in victimization over time, no such association exists with the perceived risk of victimization. Most importantly, as adolescents become more involved in a delinquent lifestyle and are victimized at a higher rate than nondelinquent youth, their fear of victimization actually decreases at a significantly higher rate than more prosocial youth. © 2009 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - This study aims to present an integrated theoretical framework to analyse the effects of different social forces on delinquent behaviour. The main goal of the integrated theory is to explain the links between the sociological explanations of crime and the rational choice model by applying human capital and social capital accumulation processes as the main argument. Various social forces and institutions such as school, family, and peers are examined under the integrated theoretical framework for their potential impacts on two types of deviant behaviour: violent acts and property crime. Evidence from a Montreal sample shows individual decisions to participate in violent acts and property crimes as being influenced by different social forces. Self-reported violent acts are shown to have significant positive relationships with having early market work experiences at a young age, and with knowing delinquent friends and criminal adults. Conversely attending classes at school is shown to have a significant negative relationship with self-reported violent acts. Self-reported participation in property crime, on the other hand, is positively related with having more pocket money, with the presence of delinquent siblings, and with knowing delinquent friends and criminal adults. It is negatively related to living with both biological parents and attending classes at school. The findings provided here further take into account the joint nature of the decision and show that individuals who engage in violent acts are simultaneously more likely to participate in property crimes and vice versa. The study is concluded with the presentation of potential delinquency prevention strategies and policy implications based on the Montreal empirical evidence. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. In addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements - the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention - to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - This article examines whether potentially criminogenic places (including bars, liquor stores, restaurants, public transport hubs, drug markets, and more), located within a 1,240-feet radius of parolees’ residences (the home “node”), predict their rearrest or revocation. Taking these features into account, in addition to individual traits and behaviors, might pave the way for more accurate risk assessment that could help make supervision sensitive to place-based risks. However, multivariate survival analysis of 1,632 parolees released to Newark during July 2007 to June 2009 found little evidence that these factors increased the risk of failure. Successful operationalization of environmental risk will probably need to incorporate more detailed measures of parolees’ routine activities, including the settings and paths they frequent beyond their home environment. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - The aim of this article is straightforward and practical: by utilising elements of routine activity and rational choice theories, it explains how online child sex offenders use the Internet and what can be done to counter the challenge they pose. The discussion opens with definitions of child pornography, child erotica, child exploitation material and paedophilia. Its main objective is to promote online protection of children. It is explained that online child sex offenders and paedophiles use the Internet to create virtual communities; collect, share and trade images; tempt, seduce and groom children. Then the article explores what has been done in the Western world to combat those criminal activities. Successful campaigns against child pornography require shared responsibility and effort by parents, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), legal enforcement and the international community at large. © 2013 The Howard League and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - São Paulo is the largest city in South America, with crime rates that reflect its size. The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion, Revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data. The experiments show the capability of CrimAnalyzer in identifying crime-related phenomena. © 2015 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research attempts to elaborate a routine activity model of violent victimization by incorporating an explicit rational choice perspective on potential targets' decision making to avoid violent encounters. We propose that the costs associated with a violent attack and the probability of offender retaliation depend on whether the offender's targeting strategy is opportunistic or deliberate-a function of the relational distance between the offender and target. Specifically, we propose that victim efforts to limit exposure to an offender may motivate a violent retaliatory response when the victim and offender are intimates compared to when they are strangers. We develop hypotheses based on these ideas and test them using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (1992-2000). The results suggest that female targets are more sensitive to an offender's targeting strategy than are males. We conclude with a discussion of how knowledge of the potential risk of violent retaliation on the part of intimate and spousal offenders can be used to create more efficacious policies to protect victims of violence.

AB  - Alfred Adler is often introduced and discussed incorrectly as one of Freud's students and as a psychoanalytic theorist in criminology and psychology textbooks. While thinkers such as Freud and Jung theorize about crime in tangential ways, as almost an afterthought to their accounts of neurosis and personality, Alfred Adler was one of the few pioneers in the history of psychology who had an actual theory of crime. Yet, Adler's writings on crime, its causes and assumptions have been largely overlooked in contemporary research. While Adler espoused the view that crime represents a "useless" response to the social demands of life, we argue that Adler's theory of crime presupposes a rational choice model of criminal behavior, thus mirroring the Classical School perspective on crime. This paper provides a synthesis and a critique of Alfred Adler's theory of crime. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To apply crime-specific models based on differing potential offender pools and opportunity structures to temporary and permanent motor vehicle theft (MVT). Method: Using 310 U.S. cities with 50,000 or more residents, the current study developed and examined crime-specific multivariate models for temporary and permanent MVT rates. To evaluate the distinctiveness of crime-specific variables' associations with each MVT type, the study also predicted each MVT rate via measures theoretically specific to the other. Results: Among temporary-specific variables, young male population and the percentage of households without a vehicle were positively associated with temporary MVT. Permanent-specific measures of adult male property offender pool size, percentage of households with high disposable income, unemployment, U.S.-Mexico border proximity, and autorelated businesses were associated with permanent MVT (though in an unexpected direction for disposable income). Some variables were associated with both types of MVT, but young male population was uniquely associated with temporary MVT while unemployment rate, distance to U.S.-Mexico border and number of auto-related businesses were specific to permanent MVT. Conclusions: Findings suggest that specific prevention approaches are needed for each type of MVT. Shortcomings of the research include potential misclassification of temporary and permanent MVT and lack of some potentially important opportunity variables. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Introduction The journey to crime is one of the central elements of environmental criminology. The connection between where offenders live and where they offend is of both theoretical and practical interest in the study of the geography of crime. The nature of this relationship is addressed by both Brantingham and Brantingham’s (1993c) crime pattern theory and Cohen and Felson’s (1979) routine activity theory; it also informs the core functioning of geographic profiling models. Despite this conceptual centrality, little is known of the spatial dynamics of the journey to crime beyond the distance between offenders’ homes and their crime sites. © 2012 Martin A.

AB  - The rise in prescription drug abuse is changing crime patterns among drug users and the structure of illegal drug markets. The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. Our study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. Our findings indicate that individuallevel characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed. © 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article examines criminal behavior from a rational choice perspective, the set of behavioral principles underlying our legal institution. The authors use a subjective utility approach and specify experiential learning models of the formation of risk perceptions and rational choice models of theft and violence. They estimate the models using panel data on high risk youth from the Denver Youth Survey. Using random effects Tobit models of perceived risk and negative binomial models of counts of criminal acts, the authors find support for a rational choice model. Perceived risk follows a Bayesian updating model in which current risk perceptions are a function of prior risk perceptions plus new information based on experience with crime and arrest and observations of peers. Theft and violence are a function of the perceived risk of arrest, subjective psychic rewards (including excitement and social status), and perceived opportunities.

AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders’ target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders’ searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes. © 2014 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The prominent role of facilities in influencing ‘why crime happens where it does’ has been widely recognized and vigorously researched. Criminological theories which focus on opportunity such as routine activity theory and crime pattern theory have provided the basis for such inquiries. Some of these investigations have targeted the role of facilities in fueling higher crime levels at places. They have usually developed facility-focused measures that quantify each facility’s influence based on the crime experienced by the places located near it. Measures are calculated only at the locations with facilities present. However, improvements in data sources and software have allowed researchers to examine the population of small units of geography rather than focusing on only those with a facility present. Thus it is now possible to quantify the cumulative effect of nearby facilities on the crime rates of geographies of such street blocks and addresses. This chapter begins by discussing the traditional methods for exploring the relationship between facilities and crime. Next, the theoretical case for more sophisticated distance and activitylevel based measures is made. The critical role of geoprocessing models in automating complex analysis processes is explained and a model developed to create three different exposure measures. Data describing the locations of drinking places and street block level crime are used to illustrate how measures produced by the model can be used to explore the relationships between exposure to facilities and an outcome such as crime. The output measures from the model are evaluated using descriptive statistics and then used as independent variables in an ordinary least squares regression. Local variation in the measures is examined using a bivariate LISA to highlight areas of negative and positive spatial autocorrelation between exposure to bars and crime. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings and probable next steps. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - This chapter describes the contribution of "mainstream" theories of crime to the explanation of female delinquency and the gender gap in delinquency. Such theories include strain theory; social learning theory; control theory; labeling theory; deterrence, rational choice, and routine activities theories; Moffi tt's theory of life-course persistent offending; and selected integrated theories. These theories tend to explain crime in terms of characteristics of the individual and the individual's immediate social environment. (Chapter 8, this volume, by Zahn and Browne focuses on the effect of the larger social environment, particularly the community, on female delinquency.) This chapter examines contributions of each theory in turn and concludes by listing the key insights from these theories. As noted by several criminologists, most mainstream theories were developed to explain male delinquency, and most tests of these theories devote little or no attention to gender (Kruttschnitt 1996; Miller and Mullins 2006; Morash 1999; Morris 1987; Steffensmeier and Allan 1996; Steffensmeier and Broidy 2001). However, some researchers in recent years have applied these theories to the explanation of female delinquency and the gender gap in delinquency. Data suggest that the causal factors identifi ed by these theories do apply to females and that these theories can explain much of the gender gap in delinquency (Jensen 2003; Jensen and Eve 1976; Lanctot and Le Blanc 2002; Moffi tt et al. 2001; Rowe, Vazsonyi, and Flannery 1995; Simons, Miller, and Aigner 1980; Smith 1979; Smith and Paternoster 1987). At the same time, these theories are somewhat limited in the explanations they provide. In particular, they often fail to account for the complex relationship between gender and delinquency. For example, many fail to explain why gender differences in delinquency vary by type of delinquency (e.g., why gender differences are greatest for serious violence). Also, they offer little insight into gender differences in the context or nature of particular crimes (e.g., gender differences in the motivation, victim characteristics, and level of injury for violent crimes). Further, they often fail to consider fully the varied mechanisms by which gender may infl uence delinquency (e.g., gender differences in socialization, social control, social position, power/resources, interactional dynamics, and opportunities). Finally, they fail to consider the ways in which gender interacts with race, class, and age to affect delinquency. To be fair, these problems affect many feminist theories as well, but they are particularly common among mainstream theories. Clearly, a complete explanation of female delinquency will require that the insights of mainstream theories be integrated with those of feminist theories and the research on gender and crime. Describing the contributions of mainstream theories is a first step toward that integration. © 2009 by The Temple University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The macro-level approach reemerged as a salient criminological paradigm in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Prompted by new theories and reformulations of existing ones, over 200 empirical studies explored ecological correlates of crime. Few efforts have been made, however, to "make sense" of this literature. A "meta-analysis" was undertaken to determine the relative effects of macro-level predictors of crime. Indicators of "concentrated disadvantage" (e.g., racial heterogeneity, poverty, and family disruption) are among the strongest and most stable predictors. Except for incarceration, variables indicating increased use of the criminal justice system (e.g., policing and gettough policy effects) are among the weakest. Across all studies, social disorganization and resource/economic deprivation theories receive strong empirical support; anomie/strain, social support/social altruism, and routine activity theories receive moderate support; and deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories receive weak support. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Pattern and routine activities theories suggest that through a combination of decisions and innate understandings of environmental cues, likely offenders are able to separate good criminal opportunities from bad risks. The nature of this process is highly structured and allows researchers to anticipate likely concentrations for a variety of regular, daily activities, including criminal offences. This chapter sets out to model and test these theoretical principles. Mastermind represents an interdisciplinary research project in computational criminology jointly managed by ICURS and the Software Technology Lab at Simon Fraser University. Using the abstract state machine (ASM) formalism in combination with a multiagent based modeling paradigm, we devise a formal framework for semantic modeling and systematic integration of the theories for crime analysis and understanding crime patterns. We focus on crime in urban areas and model spatial and temporal aspects of crime potentially involving multiple offenders and multiple targets. Mastermind is used in a hypothetical analysis of motor vehicle theft. © 2008, IGI Global.

AB  - Prior research has identified a link between schools (particularly high schools) and neighborhood crime rates. However, it remains unclear whether the relationship between schools and crime is a reflection of other criminogenic dynamics at the neighborhood level or whether schools influence neighborhood crime patterns independently of other established structural predictors. We address this question by investigating the relationship between schools and serious crime at the block group level while controlling for the potentially criminogenic effects of neighborhood instability and structural disadvantage. We find that, net of other structural correlates, neighborhoods with high schools and middle schools experience more violent, property, and narcotics crimes than those without middle or high schools. Conversely, neighborhoods with elementary schools exhibit less property crime than those not containing elementary schools. These results, which are consistent with prior research and with explanations derived from the routine activities and social disorganization perspectives, suggest some strategies for police deployment and community involvement to control crime. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Following the lead of Grasmick and Bursik (1990), we propose that significant others and conscience both function as agents of social control to deter illicit behavior in a manner similar to that provided by the law and more formal, bureaucratic organizations. All three - conscience, significant others, and formal organizations - entail potential threats and costs (i.e., shame, embarrassment, and formal sanctions). Actors consider these potential threats and costs, and assess the certainty and severity of them, in deciding whether or not to engage in criminal or deviant behavior. In the research reported here, data from a sample of undergraduate students are employed to examine the effects of perceived certainty and severity of shame, embarrassment, and formal sanction threats of the self-reported prevalence of involvement in a variety of forms of academic dishonesty. The results suggest rather limited support for the deterrence/rational choice model, nearly all of which is due to the influence of conscience (shame).

AB  - There is an ongoing American policy debate about the appropriate legal status for psychoactive drugs. Prohibition, decriminalization, and legalization positions are all premised on assumptions about the behavioral effects of drug laws. What is actually known and not known about these effects is reviewed. Rational-choice models of legal compliance suggest that criminalization reduces use through restricted drug availability, increased drug prices, and the deterrent effect of the risk of punishment. Research on these effects illustrates the need for a more realistic perspective that acknowledges the limitations of human rationality and the importance of moral reasoning and informal social control factors. There are at least 7 different mechanisms by which the law influences drug use, some of which are unintended and counterproductive. This framework is used to explore the potential behavioral effects of decriminalization and legalization.

AB  - Rational choice models of bargaining power are usually held to justify the pluralist methodology of decision analysis. This paper rejects this view and argues that such models are able to combine the pluralists’ concern with overt behaviour and the operationalizability of the concept of power with their critics’ emphasis upon the systemic or structural features of power and its cognates. We overcome charges of conservative bias which tend to be directed at rational choice theories by deriving from the model reasons why a rational actor would object to concentrations of power within his community. A theory which provides us with a measure of power which is at least notionally empirical and is capable of determining why, and to what extent moral sensibilities are offended by power concentrations would, we feel, enable the discipline to throw off the straitjacket which has constrained the analysis of power over the past two decades.

AB  - We extend the use of rational choice models of criminal activity to examine the use of 'sting' operations. These operations are modeled as technological innovations in law enforcement that influence the probability of detection/conviction of criminal activities. We ask: do all sting operations have the same impact on the supply of criminal activity? We find that such impacts are sensitive to the type of sting used and the competitiveness of the criminal market in which the sting is used. © 1993.

AB  - Although the murders committed by serial killers may not be considered rational, there is growing evidence that the locations in which they commit their crimes may be guided by an implicit, if limited rationality. The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time. Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The present article examines the key concepts underlying victimization theories (i.e., exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, guardianship). Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization. © 1990, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

AB  - Decisions to commit crimes are often made under the influence of visceral feelings such as anger or sexual arousal. Rational choice models of offender decision-making assume that individuals can anticipate, in an unaroused state, their responses to such visceral feelings. This assumption is tested in an experiment in which sexually aroused and nonaroused males predict their own behavior in a date rape scenario. Aroused and nonaroused participants were asked a battery of questions designed to measure their perceptions of the costs and benefits of acting in a sexually aggressive manner, their level of arousal, and a probabilistic prediction as to how aggressively they would act in the conditions described in the scenario. The authors find that sexual arousal does increase subjects expectations of their own sexual aggressiveness and that this impact is not mediated by perceptions of the costs or benefits of such aggression.

AB  - Much individual-level research in criminology is based on deterministic: models of street-crime and suite-crime. Factors that constrain individuals to crime or conformity are predominant. This paper explores the advantages of a more soft determinism in explaining crime; especially intimate violence. Routine activities theory, which assumes freedom of action and rational choice, is used here to analyze patterns of intimate violence, especially, child sexual abuse. Marcus Felson's model of predatory crime provides a unique interpretation of intimate violence. Criminal incidents involve the physical convergence of three elements: a motivated offender; a suitable target; and the absence of a capable guardian. The convergence of these factors in intimate violence is analyzed; the potential of routine activity theory in explaining domestic abuse is assessed. Finally, suggestions for crime control in intimate violence based on routine activities theory are presented.

AB  - Crime analysis uses past crime data to predict future crime locations and times. Typically this analysis relies on hot spot models that show clusters of criminal events based on past locations of these events. It does not consider the decision making processes of criminals as human initiated events susceptible to analysis using spatial choice models. This paper analyzes criminal incidents as spatial choice processes. Spatial choice analysis can be used to discover the distribution of people's behaviors in space and time. Two adjusted spatial choice models that include models of decision making processes are presented. The comparison results show that adjusted spatial choice models provide efficient and accurate predictions of future crime patterns and can be used as the basis for a law enforcement decision support system. This paper also extends spatial choice modeling to include the class of problems where the decision makers' preferences are derived indirectly through incident reports rather than directly through survey instruments.

AB  - This study examined the effects of shame proneness and two types of anticipated shame states - shame due to exposure and shame without exposure - in a rational choice model of offending intentions. Using scenario-based survey data from a sample of university students, it was found that (a) anticipated shame states without exposure reduced intentions to drive drunk and shoplift and (b) anticipated shame states due to exposure reduced shoplifting intentions. By contrast, shame proneness had a positive effect on decisions to commit both drunk driving and shoplifting. The findings support the rational choice model of offending and indicate that the effects of shame are important components in individuals' decisions to offend.

AB  - Terrorist events such as suicide bombings are rare yet extremely destructive events. Responses to such events are even rarer, because they require forecasting methods for effective prevention and early detection. While many forecasting methods are available, few are designed for conflict scenarios. This paper builds on previous work in forecasting criminal behavior using spatial choice models. Specifically we describe the fusion of two techniques for modeling the spatial choice of suicide bombers into a unified forecast that combines spatial likelihood modeling of environmental characteristics with logistic regression modeling of demographic features. In addition to describing the approach we also provide motivation for the fusion of the methods and contrast the results obtained with those from the more common kernel density estimation methods that do not account for variation in the event space. We give an example of successful use of this combined method and an evaluation of its performance. We conclude that the fusion method shows improvement over other methods and greater scalability for combining larger numbers of spatial forecasting methods than were previously available. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - This article applies the theory of individual rational choice to micro data on the criminal activity of juveniles. The individual choice model is developed and applied to data on 1,171 files on property offenses adjudicated by the Family Court between 1972 and 1976. It is found that the type of crime chosen, as indicated by the charge at the time of arrest and the final charge, is influenced by sex, age, number of prior referrals to the court, ethnic extraction, and place of residence of the juvenile. As the effect of each of these individual characteristics on the probability of selecting the various crimes differs, the choice of crime exhibits dynamic features; as the individual age increases, and as the number of prior referrals to court increases, the probabilities of selecting particular crimes change. These features are examined by generating the probabilities and examining the patterns which emerge. © 1982.

AB  - In studying the causes of crime, most criminologists have concentrated on traditional socio-demographic variables, such as age, sex, race, and socio-economic status. However, some researchers have investigated the influence of the physical environment on criminal behaviour. There is a recent theoretical basis for research into the influence of weather on crime: the situational approach, rational choice theory, and routine activities theory all suggest that weather could significantly influence crime rates and criminal behaviour. This paper brings together for the first time the accumulated research on weather and crime. It discusses the theoretical background, examines research into the influence of different weather conditions (such as high temperatures, rain, and wind) on various types of criminal behaviour, outlines problems with the current research, and suggests ways of advancing knowledge about weather and crime. © 1990 The Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency.

AB  - Deaths of young brides through suicide or homicide following disputes over the dowry (gifts given by the brideâ€™s family to that of the groom during and after the marriage) are increasingly a feature of Indian society. Explanations of this social problem have been too heavily concentrated on the socio-cultural and psychological factors implicated and need to be supplemented by victimological and criminological concepts, drawn especially from routine activity and rational choice perspectives. A model incorporating these concepts within a traditional socio-cultural and psychological framework is presented. This more complete model of the phenomenon needs to be empirically verified, but in time may assist in developing a wider range of preventive strategies. © 1995, A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - The spatial analysis of crime and the current focus on hotspots has pushed the area of crime mapping to the fore, especially in regard to high volume offenses such as vehicle theft and burglary. Hotspots also have a temporal component, yet police recorded crime databases rarely record the actual time of offense as this is seldom known. Police crime data tends, more often than not, to reflect the routine activities of the victims rather than the offense patterns of the offenders. This paper demonstrates a technique that uses police START and END crime times to generate a crime occurrence probability at any given time that can be mapped or visualized graphically. A study in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, demonstrates that crime hotspots with a geographical proximity can have distinctly different temporal patterns.

AB  - This article presents research findings from three analyses of criminal activity among youth. The data set used in all three is the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Americans, a data set that is particularly appropriate for this type of analysis. The work examined the relationship between criminal behavior and family and moral influences; the impact of legitimate labor market activity on participation in crime; and the effect of school enrollment on criminal activity. The findings confirm the hypothesis that black and white differences in criminal participation partially reflect differences in economic opportunity. © 1987 Springer.

AB  - What factors determine the plea bargain which prosecutors will offer defendants? What factors determine whether or not a defendant will demand a trial? The former question is relevant to our assessment of the fairness of plea bargaining; the latter question is relevant to prosecution management. Landes provides an economic model of the criminal courts which suggests answers to these questions. While several researchers have provided empirical analysis at least consistent with the Landes model, there has been no test of the model's power for predicting individual case decisions. After providing a derivation of a rational choice model similar to that of Landes but incorporating organizational considerations, the empirical validity of the model is tested using individual case data. Major predictions, including the structural form of the plea bargain offer equation, are validated. Other findings, which do not validate the model's predictions, are discussed in terms of the organizational incentive structure facing assistant prosecutors. A discussion of the application of the model to aid in prosecution management is presented, including an indication of the importance of looking at the distribution of prediction errors as well as the overall rate of prediction error. Finally, comments are made concerning the use of econometrics in an organizational context. © 1978 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.
