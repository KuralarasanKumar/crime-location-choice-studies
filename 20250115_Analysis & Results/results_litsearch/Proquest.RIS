AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

AB  - We argue that a rational choice framework can be used to explain declines in offending from adolescence to young adulthood in two ways. First, subjective expectations of offending can be age graded such that perceptions of rewards decrease and perceptions of risks and costs increase. Second, the marginal (dis)utility of crime may be age graded (e.g., preferences for risks, costs, and rewards). We examine changes in offending from adolescence to young adulthood among a subset of individuals from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 585) and employ a nonlinear decomposition model to partition differences in offending attributable to changing subjective expectations (X) and changing marginal utilities (β). The results indicate that both have direct and independent effects on changes in offending over time. The results of a detailed decomposition on the subjective expectations also indicate that differences exist across the type of incentives. That is, the effect of changing expectations is attributed mainly to changes in perceived rewards (both social and intrinsic). Changing expectations of social costs and risk of arrest from offending have weak effects on changes in criminal behavior, which suggests that they must be accompanied by increases in the weight placed on these expectations to promote appreciable declines in offending.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - ObjectivesCrime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day.MethodsWe put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations.ResultsThe results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day.ConclusionOur extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.

AB  - Youth misuse of fire is a substantive community concern. Despite evidence which indicates youths account for a significant proportion of all deliberately lit fires within Australia, an absence of up-to-date, contextually specific research means the exact scope and magnitude of youth misuse of fire within Australia remains unknown. Despite research suggesting commonalities exist between youth misuse of fire and juvenile offending more broadly, misuse of fire is rarely explained using criminological theory. In light of this gap, a descriptive analysis of youth misuse of fire within New South Wales was performed. Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory were tested to explain differences in misuse of fire across age groups. Results suggest these environmental theories offer useful frameworks for explaining youth misuse of fire in New South Wales. It is argued that the Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory can be employed to better inform youth misuse of fire policy and prevention efforts.

AB  - Using data that combines information from the Federal Aviation Administration, the RAND Corporation and a newly developed database on global terrorist activity, we are able to examine trends in 1,101 attempted aerial hijackings that occurred around the world from 1931 to 2003. We have especially complete information for 828 hijackings that occurred before 1986. Using a rational choice theoretical framework, we use continuous-time survival analysis to estimate the impact of several major counterhijacking interventions on the hazard of differently motivated hijacking attempts and logistic regression analysis to model the predictors of successful hijackings. Some of these interventions use certainty-based strategies of target hardening to reduce the perceived likelihood of success. Others focus on raising the perceived costs of hijacking by increasing the severity of punishment. We also assess which strategies were most effective in deterring hijackers whose major purpose was related to terrorism. We found support for the conclusion that new hijacking attempts were less likely to be undertaken when the certainty of apprehension was increased through metal detectors and law enforcement at passenger checkpoints. We also found that fewer hijackers attempted to divert airliners to Cuba once that country made it a crime to hijack flights. Our results support the contagion view that hijacking rates significantly increase after a series of hijackings closely clustered in time-but only when these attempts were successful. Finally, we found that the policy interventions examined here significantly decreased the likelihood of nonterrorist but not that of terrorist hijackings. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Despite the intense and prolonged public attention received when a child is abducted and killed, there are major gaps in the academic literature. One of the gaps pertains to the distances traveled by the offender between key crime locations. The overall aim of this study was to provide information concerning typical travel distances of offenders. This project utilized an archival data set compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The database constructed for this project consisted of 72 victims who were abducted and murdered by 68 offenders. The date range for these offenses was 1970–2006. The research questions were addressed with t-tests for independent samples and multiple linear regressions. Three primary dependent variables under investigation in this study were (a) the distance between the offender's residence and the abduction site, (b) the distance between the abduction site and the disposal of the victim's remains, (c) the distance between the location of the body disposal site and the offender's residence. Additionally, a multitude of bivariate analyses were examined. The variables examined in various combinations using bivariate analyses were offender characteristics, victim characteristics, distance variables, and crime event variables.  Although findings were primarily insignificant, they contribute to the general literature regarding child abduction homicide offenses. While a number of studies have related child abduction/homicide to specific contexts, little research has been done relating child abduction to theoretical frameworks. This study explored routine activities theory, rational choice theory, and crime pattern theory as they relate to the geographical behavior of child abductors/murderers.

AB  - This study analyses 300 cases of fraudulent activities against Dutch businesses, 100 from each of the following three categories: CEO-fraud, fraudulent contract, and ghost invoice. We examine crime scripts, key characteristics of targeted businesses, and the relationship between input criminal effort and output financial benefit. Results indicate that whilst all CEO-frauds are conducted online, most of the fraudulent contracts and ghost invoices are undertaken via offline means. Both Routine Activity Theory and Rational Choice Model are evidenced-fraudsters clearly take the business size and seasonality into account, and the input criminal effort and output criminal benefit are positively correlated. Having vigilant employees is evidenced as the most effective way of fraud prevention, both online and offline.

AB  - This paper proposes that legislation should be used to reduce the occurrence of courthouse violence.  It begins with a review of what is known about the nature and costs of court targeted and non-targeted violence, drawing on published materials of the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Secret Service, the Center for Judicial and Executive Security, and others.  Previously unpublished materials are also reported.  Court security efforts made in response to the violence are described. In the absence of empirical studies of the effectiveness of court security laws, the paper suggests that theories of criminology be used as guides for assessing the effectiveness of existing legislation and formulating new legislation. Criminological theories, including classical theory, rational choice theory, strain theory, and routine activity theory are discussed as models appropriate for use in evaluating court security legislation.  Existing state and federal laws on paper terrorism, including false liens and U.C.C. filings; address confidentiality programs; and enhanced punishments for crimes against those involved in the judicial process are described, catalogued, and analyzed.

AB  - Problem-oriented policing (POP) dynamically addresses unique community issues in a way that allows police departments to be cost-effective and efficient. POP draws upon routine activities and rational choice theories, at times incorporating elements of crime prevention through environmental design. A recent systematic review found POP to be hugely popular, but not rigorously assessed or implemented. In 2009, the Glendale, Arizona Police Department and researchers from Arizona State University received funding through the Bureau of Justice Assistance’s (BJA) Smart Policing Initiative (SPI) to target crime at convenience stores through a problem-oriented policing approach. The Glendale SPI team devised an approach that mirrored the ideals put forth by Goldstein (1990), and provided a thorough undertaking of the SARA model. A comprehensive response plan was developed with several proposed responses, including: intervention with Circle K leadership, suppression, and prevention at the six highest-activity stores. Despite a thorough POP implementation, the initial descriptive evaluation of the Glendale SPI reported positive effects on crime, but left questions about the intervention’s long-term impact on convenience store crime in Glendale, Arizona. The policy and theoretical influence of the initiative warrants a more rigorous evaluation. Supplanting the original assessment, a difference in difference model, negative binomial regression, and relative effect size are calculated to ascertain the SPI’s long-term effects on target and comparison stores. Phi and weighted displacement quotient are calculated to determine the existence of displacement of crime or diffusion of benefits. Overall, results indicate support for the project’s effectiveness on crime reduction. Further, none of the six intervention stores experienced crime displacement. Five of the six stores, however, experienced a diffusion of benefits in the surrounding 500-yard area; that is, a crime reduction was observed at the intervention stores and in the surrounding areas of five of these stores. Disorder and property crimes at the targeted stores were most affected by the intervention. One of the intervention stores did experience an increase in violent crime, however. Future studies should strengthen the methodological design when evaluating POP projects and seek to flesh out more precisely the crime control effects of unique problem-oriented strategies.

AB  - Experimental research indicates that alcohol has a causal influence on aggressive behavior, especially when the drinker is provoked or angered. Using a rational choice framework, the current study further examines the effects of alcohol and anger on violent decision-making. Male subjects (n  = 84) of legal drinking age participated in a randomized experiment in which intoxication and anger levels were manipulated. Afterward, all subjects read a scenario describing a confrontation between the subject and another male, and then were asked to report their likelihood of responding to the encounter with physical assault. Subjects also reported the perceived costs and benefits associated with the assault, as well as their level of confidence in winning the fight. Finally, as an additional measure of confidence, subjects also predicted how well they would play a violent video game. Results revealed that alcohol and anger did not increase subjects' own intentions to engage in assault, but did increase their expectations of similar others engaging in violence. Contrary to expectation, the perceived costs and benefits associated with the assault were generally found to be immune to the influence of alcohol and anger. Similarly, no evidence was found to suggest that alcohol increases subjects' confidence levels, but instead, that alcohol may in fact reduce feelings of confidence. Finally, results indicate that the rational choice model does not fully explain the effects of alcohol and anger on aggressive responding, suggesting that the two come together in order to increase violence above and beyond the influence of perceived costs/benefits. The rational choice model also failed to explain the variance in aggressive behavior equally well across the experimental groups, and appeared to break down when subjects were intoxicated and angry. These findings suggest that attempts to curb intoxicated aggression by increasing the certainty or severity of punishments will largely fail due to the seemingly direct effects of alcohol and anger. Additionally, these findings also call into question the robustness of the rational choice model, suggesting that the perspective may not be the general explanation for crime it is proclaimed to be.

AB  - Web defacement is a form of hacking that involves altering the content of a website, resulting in repairs to the website code, loss of revenue, internal loss of productivity, and reputational damage. Limited research has examined the frequency of web defacements, the factors that distinguish them from other hacking motives, and the extent to which the correlates mirror research on physical acts of ideologically-motivated crime. The current study examined over 2.4 million web defacements hosted in the U.S. from 2012 to 2016 to assess aspects of routine activities theory associated with target selection and attack methods among ideologically-motivated defacements. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that ideologically-motivated defacers were more likely to use unknown vulnerabilities; engage in repeated attacks; target top-level domains linked to foreign nations; domains ending in.edu; and homepages within websites. The findings of this study suggest that the target selection process of ideologically-motivated defacers are more purposive and designed to draw attention to their cause, resembling target preferences of individuals who engage in physical violence in support of an ideological agenda.

AB  - This dissertation explores why and how crime events routinely occur at specific places in high crime areas, such as street blocks, addresses, street corners, and intersections. Specifically, this dissertation considers what human activities, behaviors, routines, and situations contribute to crime occurring at these places. Routine activities theory and environmental criminology suggest that crime is a process resulting from the convergence of the daily human routines of offenders, targets, and guardians (or lack thereof). Furthermore, these opportunities for crime are sustained, enhanced, or limited based on surrounding physical and environmental features of where crimes occur. Many scholars have attempted to test the salience of these theories using spatial data analysis, quantitative data analysis, and computer simulation modeling (Bosse, Elffers, Gerritsen, 2010; Cahill, 2004; Groff, 2007; Groff, 2008; Lum, 2003). However, these methods often fall short because the process of the routines and their link to crime occurrence are not actually observed, but instead estimated from administrative data and the use of statistical modeling.  This dissertation attempts to improve our understanding about the link between routine activities, the environment, and crime using systematic social observation (SSO) of archived closed circuit television (CCTV) footage of crime events in Baltimore City. This approach serves as the best possible and safest approach to explore the salience of routine activities theory and environmental criminology, short of observing routines in real time that unfold into crimes. Given time and resource constraints, I examined 100 crime events from a collection of the Baltimore Police Department’s (BPD) archived footage. Systematic observations of each archived crime event were completed using a theoretically informed instrumentation on site at a CCTV monitoring station for six and half months, culminating in over 2,340 hours of data collection of 397 hours of actual footage.   Qualitative and exploratory data analysis produced findings largely about the routines leading up to drug crime events, with some comparison to violent and property crime. Systematic patterns of behavior leading up to crime were observed, and could be categorized into a number of common features. With respect to drug crimes, eight common features emerged that help explain the process of drug crimes unfolding in high crime places. The features varied to the degree in which they emerged, some features having a higher likelihood of occurrence than others. These findings, while exploratory, have implications for routine activities theory and crime pattern theory, and future research.

AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats.

The results of this analysis indicate that the most successful prevention strategies will be comprised of multi-faceted approaches that address micro- and macro-level factors including the public education in victimization prevention, increased guardianship in the private sector, reform of traditional law enforcement investigation techniques, increased cooperation between domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies, and heightened public awareness in the apprehension and prosecution of cyber criminals.

AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. In addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements - the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention - to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases—100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

AB  -  The basis of Situational Crime Prevention, Routine Activity Approach, Environmental Criminology, Opportunity Theory and related perspectives is the notion of rational choice. The preventive techniques are based on the assumption that a rational offender is unlikely to act if the efforts of committing a crime are greater than the expected rewards. This paper seeks to extend the notion of rational choice from the individual to the group and suggests the application of situational prevention to a new dimension - that of large-scale disorder problems such as riots, anti-government demonstrations and confrontational religious celebrations. These disorder problems pose serious challenges since these involve vicious mobs violating prohibitory orders, attacking police personnel and indulging in wanton destruction of property and violence. We argue that even though a mob behaves irrationally and indulges in senseless acts of violence and destruction, the individuals comprising the mob are rational and guided by self-interest in their behavior. Therefore, even in riotous situations, rational choice perspective can be profitably exploited to prevent mayhem. We present several cases of handling major riots and group confrontation from different parts of India. We describe the applicability of several situational techniques to controlling disorder and preventing further escalation of violence. The generalization of Situational Crime Prevention techniques to large-scale order maintenance problems is suggested. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that "taste" preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.

AB  - This volume’s contention that regulations have a powerful role in crime control contradicts the prevailing positivism of criminology—that is, the contention that criminality is largely explained by criminals’ past experiences. This article draws upon recent critiques of positivism and explains the implications for contemporary criminology. It begins by describing the ideas of a London magistrate, Patrick Colquhoun, about the determinants of crime and the best means of its control. Colquhoun’s writings were the first developed discussion of regulating crime, but they were soon eclipsed by positivist thinking. I list numerous weakness of positivism and argue that, instead of seeing offenders’ behavior as determined by their past, greater account should be taken of the situational inducements and opportunities to commit crime that they encounter in their everyday lives. Instead of positivism, the dominant model of criminology and crime control should be a neoclassicist, bounded rational choice model, which would introduce situational design and management changes to restrict offenders choices and modify behavior. That change in orientation would open limitless opportunities for criminologists.

AB  - The research objectives were to examine the concentration of crime and its temporal patterns in Niš and compare the related research results in spatial criminology. Longitudinal property and violent crime data were geocoded and assigned to three types of grid cells. Descriptive statistics were used to examine crime concentration, and spatial stability of crime was tested using a spatial point pattern test. The findings suggest an intense concentration of all crime types within all areal units and years of study. The higher rates of concentration were found in the analysis of less common robbery and violent crime. Findings of spatial pattern analysis suggest moderate to a high degree of similarity in spatial patterns among all crime types. However, sensitivity analysis indicates significant changes in the spatial distribution of both property and violent crime. Therefore, an alternative method is applied. Theoretical implications are discussed, highlighting routine activities and crime pattern theory. The study aims to instigate more spatial analysis of crime and evidence-based criminal policies within the region.

AB  - ObjectivesThe burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets.MethodsUsing police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling.ResultsImportance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations.ConclusionsImportance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making.

AB  - This study investigates target selection scripts of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sex crimes on stranger victims. Using latent class analysis, three target selection scripts were identified based on the victim's activities prior to the crime, each presenting two different tracks: (1) the Home script, which includes the (a) intrusion track and the (b) invited track , (2) the Outdoor script, which includes the (a) noncoercive track and the (b) coercive track, and (3) the Social script, which includes the (a) onsite track and the (b) off-site track. The scripts identified appeared to be used by both sexual aggressors of children and sexual aggressors of adults. In addition, a high proportion of crime switching was found among the identified scripts, with half of the 72 offenders switching scripts at least once. The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed.

AB  - Informal social control at micro-level places such as addresses, collections of addresses, and streetblocks is a critical factor in understanding crime patterns. Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing "eyes on the street" and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events. The article explains each theory, discusses the spatial scale at which the dynamics operate, highlights gaps in the current body of knowledge, and proposes a two-pronged research path forward.

AB  - Objectives:This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week.Method:The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.Results:The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open.Conclusions:The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

AB  - Background: Cryptomarkets represent an important drug market innovation by bringing buyers and sellers of illegal drugs together in a 'hidden' yet public online marketplace. We ask: How do cryptomarket drug sellers and buyers perceive the risks of detection and arrest, and attempt to limit them? Methods: We analyse selected texts produced by vendors operating on the first major drug cryptomarket, Silk Road (N = 600) alongside data extracted from the marketplace discussion forum that include buyer perspectives. We apply Fader's (2016) framework for understanding how drug dealers operating 'offline' attempt to reduce the risk of detection and arrest: visibility reduction, charge reduction and risk distribution. Results: We characterize drug transactions on cryptomarkets as stretched' across time, virtual and physical space, and handlers, changing the location and nature of risks faced by cryptomarket users. The key locations of risk of detection and arrest by law enforcement were found in 'offline' activities of cryptomarket vendors (packaging and delivery drop-offs) and buyers (receiving deliveries). Strategies in response involved either creating or disrupting routine activities in line with a non-offending identity. Use of encrypted communication was seen as 'good practice' but often not employed. 'Drop shipping' allowed some Silk Road vendors to sell illegal drugs without the necessity of handling them. Conclusion: Silk Road participants neither viewed themselves as immune to, nor passively accepting of, the risk of detection and arrest. Rational choice theorists have viewed offending decisions as constrained by limited access to relevant information. Cryptomarkets as 'illicit capital' sharing communities provide expanded and low-cost access to information enabling drug market participants to make more accurate assessments of the risk of apprehension. The abundance of drug market intelligence available to those on both sides of the law may function to speed up innovation in illegal drug markets, as well as necessitate and facilitate the development of law enforcement responses.

AB  -  ObjectivesThis article further examines the phenomenon of aggression inside barrooms by relying on the "bouncer-ethnographer" methodology. The objective is to investigate variations in aggression through time and space according to the role and routine of the target in a Montreal barroom. Thus, it provides an examination of routine activity theory at the micro level: the barroom.MethodsFor a period of 258 nights of observation in a Canadian barroom, bouncers completed reports on each intervention and provided specific information regarding what happened, when and where within the venue. In addition, the bouncer-ethnographer compiled field observations and interviews with bar personnel in order to identify aggression hotspots and "rush hours" for three types of actors within barrooms: (a) bouncers, (b) barmaids and (c) patrons.FindingsThree different patterns emerged for shifting hotspots of aggression depending on the target. As the night progresses, aggressive incidents between patrons, towards barmaids and towards bouncers have specific hotspots and rush hours influenced by the specific routine of the target inside the barroom.ImplicationsThe current findings enrich those of previous work by pointing to the relevance of not only examining the environmental characteristics of the barroom, but also the role of the target of aggression. Crime opportunities follow routine activities, even within a specific location on a micro level. Routine activity theory is thus relevant in this context, because as actors in differing roles follow differing routines, as do their patterns of victimization.

Utilizing aspects of routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, the argument is presented that both poverty and youth population will have a conditioning impact on the relationship between the presence of prosocial places and incidence of violent assault. Least squares regression was utilized in order to show that such institutions can serve as generators for offending and/or victimization, and that their location in lower income areas may magnify the problem.

Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders.MethodsAnalyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age.ResultsFindings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders.ConclusionsThis research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.

AB  - While its scope and scale can be exaggerated, the power transnational corporations (TNC) exert in the contemporary world is considerable. This is often at the expense of states, or at least is exercised in a way that can undermine states. Some interactions between corporations and states or their officers constitute prime examples of power crime. A blatant form is where corporations either offer or else agree to pay bribes to state officials in order to secure a major contract. This capacity to corrupt state officials via large scale bribes gives corporations significant potential power. This article begins by citing allegations of active corruption of state officials by TNCs, as well as counter-examples (i.e. where TNCs have taken a stand against rent-seeking officials). It then argues that active corruption by corporations constitutes a major dimension of power crime, and seeks to explain apparently contradictory behaviours by TNCs, relating these to rational choice theories and neo-liberalism. It is argued that recent changes in corporate governance and behaviour have made rational-choice models and simplistic neo-liberalism either questionable or redundant. Bu at the same time, globalisation and its stable mate neo-liberalism encourage improper behaviour-various forms of power crime-by corporations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - To investigate the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterning of arson incidents in a large urban county. Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space-time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy. Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons. Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this "invisible" Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment. Results may aid in inductive theory building as well as efforts to investigate and prevent arson. [web URL: http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/53/1/66.abstract]

AB  - ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

This study evaluates the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporal and spatial patterns of crime in three major cities under very different national contexts. Each of the three countries and cities experienced different levels of pandemic restrictions and societal closure. The cities of New York (the United States), São Paulo (Brazil), and Stockholm (Sweden) were selected as cases. Temporal quantitative methods, spatial statistics techniques, and Geographical Information System (GIS) underlie the methodology used in this study. Findings show that there is a statistically significant break in the trend in crime levels after the stay-at-home orders were implemented in New York City, São Paulo, and Stockholm in the first months of 2020; the only exception was for murder. Such an impact varies by crime type and city context, but increases again after a few months, indicating how fast crime and criminals adapt. Residential burglary decreased, whereas nonresidential burglary increased overall. Changes in the levels and geography of vehicle thefts were observed, with an overall increase of significant cold spots but, in several cases, also solidification of existing crime concentrations in known crime attractors and in some deprived areas.

AB  - PurposeThis paper analyzes trading and tipping activities in insider trading litigation decided by federal courts from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014.Design/methodology/approachLegal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes.FindingsResults of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements.Originality/valueThis paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense.

AB  - This study investigates the spatial and temporal patterns of property crime at the census block level in the mid-sized, medium- to high-income city of Coral Gables, Florida, USA, between 2004 and 2016. Specifically, we analyzed residential and vehicular burglary. We used Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA) to locate and identify crime hot and cold spots over time. In order to understand the role that various sociodemographic variables play in predicting crime patterns, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to analyze the spatial clustering of crime, and commercial areas, renter percentage, median household income, and multifamily households. Our results revealed consistent hotspots for residential and vehicle burglary within the northeast area of the city, while vehicle burglary had hotspots along U.S. Route 1 (US-1)—a main road in Coral Gables—and around the University of Miami, with emerging hotspots within the northwest part of the city bordering lower-income areas. Hotspots were associated with structural factors within and around the city including more multifamily homes, higher poverty rates, more renters, and greater economic disadvantage in surrounding municipalities. Social disorganization and routine activity perspectives are supported as frameworks to understand crime patterns in this context. The findings suggest that policymakers should target specific locations using geospatial analyses to better address property crime.

AB  - Problem-oriented policing (POP) is one of the various proactive policing strategies that have been developed since the 1970s. It has been claimed that POP has had a considerable effect in reducing crime (Weisburd et al., 2010). However, its role in the crime drop that has been experienced in England and Wales and across the world since the 1990s (Tseloni et al., 2010) is not yet known (Weisburd and Majmundar, 2018). Therefore, this thesis explores the role of POP in the burglary drop at the police force area (PFA) level in England and Wales between 1988 and 2007/08.The theories that underpin both POP and this study are opportunity-related theories (rational choice and routine activity theories), social disorganisation theory, and the new public management concept. The empirical component of the study is divided into three phases, where each phase employs different methods (e.g. multilevel negative binomial regression) to analyse a rich array of data sources (e.g. the Crime Survey for England and Wales). The results of this thesis can be summarised as follows:1. A number of police forces in England and Wales were consistently committed to POP over time.2. There seemed to be a relationship between POP and the fall in burglaries and repeat burglaries in a number of POP-committed PFAs between 1995 and 2007/08.3. Although POP-committed police forces experienced fewer burglaries in 2003/04, POP did not result in a statistically significant reduction in burglaries between 1995 and 2003/04.4. Conversely, POP-committed police forces saw a statistically significantly higher number of burglaries in 1997.5. Police forces with a higher number of police officers per 1000 residents experienced a statistically significant reduction in burglaries in 2003/04.In light of the above findings, this thesis sheds new light on the crime drop and policing literature.Consequently, the findings inform the theoretical and practical aspects of POP that can be used by police and other crime prevention agencies to reduce burglary victimisation.

AB  - Places with persistently high levels of crime, hot spots, are an important object of study. To some extent, the high levels of crime at such hot spots are likely to be related to flows of people. City center locations with large flows of people are quite often also hot spots, e.g., hot spots for pick pocketing at a central train station, or hot spots for assault in the nightlife district. This can be related to crime pattern theory, or to the routine activity perspective, which both suggest that flows of people can affect crime. The present study attempts to explore and quantify whether there are differences in the association between flows of people and crime for different crime types. The analysis considers locations with high crime counts for six crime types in the city of Malmö, Sweden. For each crime type, hot spots are identified and mapped, and in order to explore whether, or how, these are related to flows of people, the crime levels are then analyzed in relation to the number of people who boarded a local bus (N = 33,134,198) nearby. The paper shows that all six crime types are associated with flows of people, although less so for arson and vandalism. This is hypothesized to be due to the relatively constant target availability for these crimes as opposed to the other crime types studied.

AB  - Youth misuse of fire is a substantive community concern. Despite evidence which indicates youths account for a significant proportion of all deliberately lit fires within Australia, an absence of up-to-date, contextually specific research means the exact scope and magnitude of youth misuse of fire within Australia remains unknown. Despite research suggesting commonalities exist between youth misuse of fire and juvenile offending more broadly, misuse of fire is rarely explained using criminological theory. In light of this gap, a descriptive analysis of youth misuse of fire within New South Wales was performed. Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory were tested to explain differences in misuse of fire across age groups. Results suggest these environmental theories offer useful frameworks for explaining youth misuse of fire in New South Wales. It is argued that the Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory can be employed to better inform youth misuse of fire policy and prevention efforts.

AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders’ previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders’ knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location’s crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives -- crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - The age–crime curve has been regarded as a stylized fact of the age–crime relationship. However, recent studies have found that some Asian countries have an age–crime distribution that deviates from the archetypal age–crime curve. This variation has been attributed to cultural factors associated with age effects. Using age-specific arrest data from Korea for the years 1976 through 2019, this study offers a complementary explanation of divergent age–crime patterns across countries. We make an empirical case that the observed difference between the Korean age–crime distribution and the archetypical age–crime curve in Western countries cannot be due to contextual influence on age effects alone. The age–crime relationship in Korea shows both static and dynamic characteristics. The age–period–cohort analysis of variance shows that age effects largely explain the age–crime relationship, but period and cohort effects also explain the change in the age–crime relationship over time. Moreover, the extent to which each effect manifests depends on the type of crime. Based on our findings, we propose hypotheses regarding the role of social context in shaping each effect. We suggest that cultural factors largely shaped age effects by creating age-graded changes in the social control mechanism and in routine activities. In addition, we suggest that other contextual factors, such as population dynamics, simultaneously shaped period and cohort effects by changing the level of social control, and routine activities across birth cohorts. Both cultural and historical dimensions of social context are required to understand divergent age–crime patterns across countries.

AB  - Objectives:This article examines to what extent repeat offenders’ crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times.Methods:Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.Results:Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime.Conclusions:Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single‐family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

AB  - The importance of neighborhoods and places in understanding crime has been widely noted in criminology. Using various units of analysis (e.g., states, counties, cities, neighborhoods, places), studies have found that crime tends to be spatially concentrated. Based on social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, relationships between the level of crime and various neighborhood characteristics have been noted in the literature. Reviews of the existing literature, however, have identified several limitations of neighborhood level studies of crime. First, many neighborhood level studies have utilized cross-sectional samples and failed to analyze temporal dynamics between neighborhood changes and crime. Second, until recently, criminological studies paid little attention to two spatial processes, spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity, in developing spatial regression models. Third, most studies examined only places and neighborhoods where crimes were committed and failed to account for where offenders were coming from. By integrating newly developed statistical methods from interdisciplinary fields with social disorganization theory and routine activities theory, this dissertation pursued a series of research questions that examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of crime at the neighborhood level. First, a longitudinal analysis of crime between 1960 and 2005 in Seattle, WA, indicated that neighborhood crime rate trajectories were characterized by quadratic functions, although there was considerable variability in both the initial level of crime and rate of change over time. The results indicated that neighborhood characteristics based on social disorganization theory and routine activities theory were important in explaining the variability in crime rate trajectories. In particular, social disorganization predicted changes in crime rates decades later, while the level of crime also changed depending on time specific opportunities for crime. For example, racial heterogeneity and residential mobility predicted the initial level of crime in 1960, while the linear rate of change was predicted by socio-economic disadvantage. Furthermore, an increase in the percentage of employed women was related with high levels of burglary and auto theft, while an increase in the percentage of public transportation users increased robbery at each time point.Second, an analysis of spatial effects indicated the importance of considering both spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity when examining the association between neighborhood characteristics and crime. In particular, although global regression models produce a single measure of association between an independent variable and a dependent variable that applies to a whole study area, the results indicated there was considerable variability in the local patterns of association between neighborhood characteristics and the level of crime. For example, the results indicated that the effects of racial heterogeneity on the level of crime varied in strength and direction across space. That is, although social disorganization theory predicts that racial heterogeneity hinders the realization of common goals among residents and increases crime, the results indicated racial heterogeneity may actually reduce crime in some neighborhoods. Variability in local patterns of association are important in further understanding social processes linking the structural characteristics of neighborhoods to the level of crime and developing place-focused crime prevention strategies.Third, an analysis of burglars’ target selection indicated that neighborhood characteristics were highly predictive of which neighborhoods burglars target. In particular, it was found that the likelihood of burglars selecting a neighborhood for the commission of their crimes increased as criminal opportunities for crime increased (e.g., weakened household guardianship due to high employment). Furthermore, the analysis also indicated that burglars’ target selection varied by burglars’ characteristics, such as age, race, and the presence of co-offenders. For example, burglars’ target selection was strongly affected by their race and the racial composition of the target neighborhood. Furthermore, younger offenders’ target selection was strongly influenced by distance from their residence to a target neighborhood, while, in addition to distance, various neighborhood characteristics also affected older offenders’ target selection.Overall, the three studies conducted in this dissertation found support for both social disorganization theory and routine activities theory in explaining crime at the neighborhood level. By empirically studying the spatial and temporal aspects of crime at the neighborhood level, this dissertation adds to existing research on the role that neighborhood characteristics play in producing crime-conducive environments.

AB  - Mass transit is often thought to be dangerous, eliciting concerns for personal security when waiting for and traveling on mass transit. One of the first steps in preventing crime in mass transit environments is to obtain accurate figures of crime. There are two mechanisms linking mass transit to crime: extension of offenders’ journey-to-crime and development of crime attractors and generators. The first mechanism has been tested by comparing crime patterns when a new light rail system was expanded into new areas; these studies reported that new transit systems do not change crime patterns. Testing the second mechanism, whether mass transit enhances crime opportunities in the neighborhoods by attracting targets and offenders alike, however, faces more challenges; testing the impact of small places on larger areas such as transit stations on crime is fraught with difficulties due to the interactions with their surrounding environments. These difficulties are even more relevant for bus stops located without clear demarcation or controlled access. Using frameworks of routine activity, crime pattern, and rational choice theories, the present study set out to investigate the relationships between bus stops and crime using Newark, New Jersey as the study area. To delineate the impact of bus stops on their surroundings from other possible covariates, the existence of commercial activities in the areas was also examined. The present research study examined five crime types: robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, theft from motor vehicle, and burglary. To better understand the impacts of spatial aspects of the data, several data analyses methods were utilized. First, the study examined the magnitude and structure of spatial dependence in the data. Second, spatial process models were performed and compared with the OLS regression results to examine the impacts of spatial aspects on the regression results. Third, to address non-normality and spatial dependence of the data, the count response model was run by adding spatial lag as one of the predictors. The data analysis results showed that both bus stops and commercial establishments were associated with increased crime in the neighborhoods. Among the business types, some of them displayed more robust relationships than others. For instance, the category of food store was almost always significant to increased crime whereas banks were not statistically significant across crime types and regression methods. Considering the fact that fear of crime plays a strong role as actual risk of crime in making travel decisions, it is suggested that the physical and social incivilities should be analyzed by performing an environmental survey using case-control design. In addition, future research should incorporate both short-term and long-term temporal analysis.

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

AB  - PurposeIn early 2020, the world faced a rapid life-changing pandemic in the form of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Citywide lockdowns with stay-at-home orders and mass closings quickly became the “new normal.” With these new mandates, routine activity, mental health and financial securities all began to experience major deviations, and it became clear that this could prove to be rather valuable in providing the opportunity for large-scale criminology experiments. This study aims to explore New York City's (NYC) crime patterns during this unique social situation. Specifically, has crime as a whole increased or decreased, and have particular crimes increased or decreased during these stressful fluid times?Design/methodology/approachThe authors briefly review previous crises and worldwide trends but focus on NYC crime as collected by the New York Police Department's statistics unit, “CompStat.” An analysis of 13 crime types from March 30 to July 5 was completed, including percent differences and individual weekly incidence rates in citywide crimes compared to the same time in 2019.FindingsThe analysis demonstrated that all crimes analyzed, except for murder and burglary, exhibited a statistically significant difference during COVID-19 conditions compared to the same time the previous year. Grand larceny auto and gun violence crimes significantly increased during COVID-19 weeks, whereas rape, other sex crimes, robbery, felony assault, grand larceny, transit, housing, misdemeanor assault and petit larceny all significantly decreased.Originality/valueDue to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, this is amongst the first studies to examine trends in NYC crime during pandemic mandates. Expanding our knowledge in these situations can inform natural disaster responses, as well as criminal justice policy and practice to better protect the public in future crises.

AB  - Conduct the first empirical intra-urban examination of community-level connections between street robbery and temperature. Examine whether community socioeconomic status (SES) and crime-relevant land uses strengthen or weaken the temperature impact. A theoretical framework relying on routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, and resident-based control dynamics organized predictions. For Philadelphia census tracts (n = 381), monthly street robbery counts and temperature data for 36 consecutive months were combined with census and land use data, and analyzed with multilevel models. Community robbery counts were higher when temperatures were higher, and in lower SES communities. In support of previous work with property crime, but in contrast to previous work with assault, the effects of temperature were stronger in higher SES communities. In support of the integrated model, commercial land use prevalence and subway stations were associated with heightened temperature impacts on robbery. Community-level fixed and random effects of temperature on urban robbery counts persist when controlling for land use and community structure; further, the random effects depend in part on both. There are implications for understanding indigenous guardianship or informal resident-based place management dynamics, and for planning seasonal police deployments.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The present article examines the key concepts underlying victimization theories (i.e., exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, guardianship). Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization.

AB  - This study examines crime rate trends in Ghana in the context of research into the international crime drop. Ghanaian police-recorded crime data are imperfect, but crime rates appear to have increased to the early 2000s then to have declined significantly. However, the national trend for all crime types masks significant variation by crime type and region. The national trends appear, broadly speaking, consistent with long-term crime increases and decreases in high-income countries, but with a lag that may reflect Ghana’s economic development trajectory. This may be consistent with the routine activity perspective if both crime opportunities and economic development increased in parallel, followed by a crime decline that reflected increased security measures or other change. The study raises many questions that require further research, and some suggestions to that end are outlined.

AB  - The dissertation examined how land uses, street network connectivity, and physical boundaries in urban settings dictate the activity patterns of persons; and thus influence spatial crime patterns. Although existing studies successfully theorized and revealed the effects of the physical environment on crime, less attention has been paid to distinguishing the specific characteristics of the physical environment that may be most important for understanding the location of crime. Drawing on the literature on crime pattern theory and the geometry of crime, the dissertation specifically focuses on the question of what characteristics of physical environments determine why some areas seem to have more crime. Thus, my dissertation draws a comprehensive picture by accounting for the effects of physical environments and structural characteristics on crime patterns in street segments informed by routine activities theory, crime pattern theory, environmental criminology, and social disorganization theory.In the first chapter of my dissertation, I explore how different land use characteristics conceptualized as activity nodes are related to the levels of both violent and property crime in street segments. These land use characteristics include: (1) type of business, (2) number of employees (as a proxy measure of the magnitude of people moving in-and-out), (3) local ownership status (e.g., whether a business is owned and run by a local entrepreneur or a non-local franchise company), and (4) age of business (e.g., number of years since a business facility has established and started operating). The next chapter focuses on the street network configurations, conceptualized as pathways, and examines their relationship with violent and property crime in street segments. In this chapter, I propose an application of the theoretical and methodological concepts of complex network topology to street network systems utilizing several conceptions of centrality: Reach and Betweenness. The final chapter of my dissertation – edges, incorporates measures of nearness of street segments to spatial boundaries. This chapter of my dissertation tests how spatial crime patterns in street segments are affected by different types of spatial boundaries, nearness to them, and the level of land use classification difference at the street segment level.

AB  -  This paper examines how hot spots shift by hour of day and day of week. Hot spot analysis is more likely to have a substantial impact on crime patterns if spatiotemporal shifts are incorporated into the crime analysis process. Even in some of the highest crime neighborhoods in Bronx County (NY), not all micro-level geographies (e.g. street segments and property lots) contain substantial (if any) amounts of crime over the 5-year study period. Moreover, while there are 168 h in a week, even the hottest hot spots do not contain crime 24 h a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year. Hot spots shift by both space and time and it is important to illustrate these dual shifts when researching and analyzing different levels of geographies and/or hot spots. Spatiotemporal crime analyses are appearing much more frequently in our academic literature in recent years and have become a principal contributor to the progression of routine activities, crime pattern theory, place-management and situational crime prevention. In addition, spatiotemporal hot spots provide important subject and opportunity context and can help answer some of the questions about what specific types of crime opportunities are available inside of hot spots based on land-use and people's movement patterns. When studying geographical hot spots, it becomes important to measure and illustrate the interrelated temporal shifts within each of the specific hot spots (i.e. not all hot spots are the same) that are generated. Similarly, when studying temporal hot spots, it is important to measure and illustrate the interrelated spatial shifts within each of the temporal frame(s) that are examined. Examples of space-time and time-space hot spot analysis are provided using violent crime data from the New York City Police Department. Key findings of this research include significant shifting of hot spots from weekday to weekend and afternoon to evening, as well as decisive spatiotemporal pattern variations between school-day robberies vs. non-school day robberies.

AB  - Criminological theories such as routine activities theory, rational choice theory, broken windows and disorder theory, crime pattern and environmental criminology, and social disorganization and collective efficacy theory all suggest the potentiality of a correlation between the presence of abandoned and dilapidated housing and crime. This thesis investigates the geographical locations of homicides that occurred in Kansas City, Missouri in 2016 and dangerous buildings as identified by the municipality. Examination indicates independent clustering of homicides and dangerous buildings and this clustering occurs in the same locational space within the city. Further, the presence of dangerous buildings within census block groups and in surrounding census block groups is correlated with homicides. This finding remains significant when measures of population, poverty, and vacancy are included in the analysis. These outcomes suggest that policies considering the presence of dangerous buildings in conjunction with other violence prevention strategies may be valuable in reducing homicide.

AB  - Restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted people’s daily routine activities. Rooted in crime pattern and routine activity theories, this study tests whether the enactment of a Safer-at-Home mandate was associated with changes in the distance between individuals’ home addresses and the locations of where they committed crimes (i.e., residence-to-crime distance). Analyses are based on violent (N = 282), property (N = 1552), and disorder crimes (N = 1092) reported to one police department located in a United States’ Midwest suburb. Multilevel models show that residence-to-crime distances were significantly shorter during the Safer-at-Home order, compared to the pre- and post-Safer-at-Home timeframes, while controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics. Additionally, these relationships varied by crime type. Consistent with the literature, the findings support the argument that individuals tend to offend relatively near their home address. The current findings extend the state of the literature by highlighting how disruptions to daily routine activities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic led to alterations in crime patterns, in which analyses indicated shorter distances between home address and offense locations.

AB  - Temporal and spatial patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil, are analyzed considering the relevance of routine activity theory in a Latin American context. We use geo-referenced criminal event data, 2010-2013, analyzing spatial patterns using census tracts and temporal patterns considering seasons, months, days, and hours. Our analyses include difference in means tests, count-based regression models, and Kulldorff’s scan test. We find that crime in Campinas, Brazil, exhibits both temporal and spatial-temporal patterns. However, the presence of these patterns at the different temporal scales varies by crime type. Specifically, not all crime types have statistically significant temporal patterns at all scales of analysis. As such, routine activity theory works well to explain temporal and spatial-temporal patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil. However, local knowledge of Brazilian culture is necessary for understanding a portion of these crime patterns.

AB  - Considering the extent of the motor vehicle theft (MVT) problem, it is surprising that there is such a dearth of studies on these crimes at the neighborhood level. In 2008, nearly one million vehicles, valued at 6.4 billion dollars, were reported stolen in the United States. Additionally, only half of these stolen vehicles were ever recovered. The purpose of this study is to increase the limited knowledge base on the characteristics of neighborhoods that predict MVT levels. Its focus is on the identification of specific types of land use that increase MVT levels, net the impact of sociodemographics, as posited by the opportunity theories of rational choice, routine activities, and crime pattern theory. The study site is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with its 1816 census block groups serving as the unit of analysis.The percentage of total land area for each block group utilized by various theorized criminogenic land uses is determined by Geographic Information System (GIS). Evaluated land uses include shopping centers, bars, high schools, colleges, parking lots, youth hangouts, and single family homes. A ‘proximity space’ variable is also computed consisting of the percentage of block group area that is located within one street block of the combined criminogenic land uses. Its usefulness is in determining whether the impact of crime-producing land uses spreads into the surrounding neighborhood. Negative binomial regression models test various hypotheses around the general research question “After controlling for socio-structural correlates, is the presence of certain land uses predictive of MVT levels found at the neighborhood level?”Results demonstrate that land use, both independently and through neighborhood demographic structure, promotes or suppresses MVT levels, a finding consistent with opportunity theories. Specifically, the percentage of land use in block groups utilized by shopping centers, bars, and commercial parking lots is related to higher MVT counts, but that utilized by colleges and single family homes predicts lower MVT counts, net the impact of neighborhood sociodemographics. Interaction models demonstrate that SES, racial heterogeneity, single-parent families, and percentage 15-24 year olds moderate the impact of land use on MVT. Findings are relevant to urban planners, crime practitioners, and crime theorists.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail -- crime pattern and social disorganization theory -- and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

AB  - Using a rational choice framework, this study examines the effects of alcohol and anger on violent decision making. Male students of legal drinking age participated in a randomized experiment in which intoxication and anger levels were manipulated. Participants read a "bar fight" scenario and completed a series of questions measuring aggressive intentions and the perceived consequences of violence. Results indicate that alcohol and anger interacted to increase one measure of aggressivity, but the perceived costs and benefits of violence were unaffected. Exploratory analyses call into question the robustness of the rational choice model, suggesting that the perspective may not be the general explanation for crime it is proclaimed to be.

AB  - The US power grid has been identified by security experts as a prime target for terrorist-based and state-sponsored cyber attacks. In addition to downing the grid, cyber attacks can also destroy and manipulate data systems, obtain sensitive intellectual property and steal trade secrets. Existing research has addressed the technical factors, such as vulnerabilities and poor intrusion detection systems, which lead to cyber attacks. However, it remains silent on the human factors in the cyber attack equation. This study uses a criminological framework, specifically Routine Activities Theory and Rational Choice Perspective to capture intelligent adversaries who plan and execute attacks based on their analysis of target suitability and guardianship efficacy. It uses a two-step methodology to identify adversary-, target-, and guardianship-specific factors that collectively impact decision-making processes. First, a document analysis of existing literature reveals nine factors (PARE RISKS) that influence adversarial decision-making: Prevention measures, Attacks and Alliances, Results, Ease of Access, Response and Recovery, Interconnectedness and Interdependencies, Security Testing, Assessments and Audits, Knowledge, Skills, Research and Development, and System Weaknesses. Second, surveys and interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 with various hackers, penetration testers, and power grid representatives helps validate and refine the PARE RISKS framework. This study identifies (i) adversary-specific factors as resources (skills, money, and time), and research (targets and techniques); (ii) target-specific factors as accessibility (electronic and physical) and weaknesses (outdated architecture and inadequate testing/updates); and (iii) guardian-specific factors as prevention (quality of prevention and intrusion detection measures). It argues that altering each of these three elements of Routine Activities Theory can impact adversarial decision-making, which may help reduce the likelihood of power grid cyber attacks.

AB  - Objectives:To determine whether criminogenic “edges,” as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES).Methods:The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected.Results:The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected.Conclusions:The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.

AB  - According to current scholarship on offender decision making, choosing to rob another is based on a variety of individual and situational characteristics. Explanatory models often invoked within environmental criminology include routine activity, rational choice and crime pattern theories. Situational action theory’s suggestion that this decision depends, at least in part, on the interaction between offender criminal propensity and the setting’s moral context has yet to be examined. This investigation tests this idea by conducting structured interviews with active probationers and parolees centered on their decoding of streetscapes to clarify offenders’ perceptions of street robbery opportunities (Part I). These results inform an agent-based simulation contrasting the merits of assumptions made in the previously stated theories to learn how well each generates realistic concentrations of street robbery (Part II). Support emerges for both environmental criminology and situational action theory, but the results differed by the method employed. Implications follow for clarifying the theoretical processes driving these incidents and for promoting public safety.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection.

AB  - Macro-criminologists often try to understand the relationship between community characteristics and violent crimes or property crimes, but less attention has been given to explaining sex crimes, especially non-violent sex crimes. This study uses a mixed method design to understand the ecological characteristics associated with non-violent sex crimes. The quantitative study uses crime incident data, demographic data, regional data, and negative binomial regression analysis to examine to what extent three different criminological theories, social disorganization theory, routine activities theory, and crime pattern theory, help explain the geographic distribution of non-violent sex crime between 2010-2012 in a southern California county. The qualitative study uses newspaper articles from 1965-2015, in-depth interviews, and grounded theory to analyze how the media, law enforcement, and local organizations work together to influence the framing and discussion concerning deviant sexual behavior in a southern California county.   A key quantitative finding suggests using measures from all three theories, specifically residential instability, suitable target rate, and connectivity, provides the most comprehensive explanation of the geographic distribution of non-violent sex crimes. Also, another key quantitative finding indicates that past crime from 2007-2009, specifically past non-violent sex crime, violent crime, and property crime, is significantly associated with the geographic distribution of non-violent sex crime incidents from 2010-2012. A key qualitative finding indicates the way non-violent sex crimes are viewed has shifted from primarily moral condemnation prior to the mid-1980s to a more general social condemnation of deviant sexual behavior that is claimed to decrease people’s quality of life. Additionally, another qualitative finding indicates law enforcement, local organizations, and the media have a cyclical relationship formed by informal and formal communication with each other that likely impacts which crime incidents make it into official crime data on non-violent sex crimes. While results demonstrated the usefulness of macro-level criminological theories to explain a variety of crime types, the findings of this dissertation show the importance of expanding criminological research beyond well-examined violent and property crime to include non-violent sex crimes to better inform criminology scholars and policy makers about these heavily stigmatized but little understood crimes.

AB  - Web defacement is a form of hacking that involves altering the content of a website, resulting in repairs to the website code, loss of revenue, internal loss of productivity, and reputational damage. Limited research has examined the frequency of web defacements, the factors that distinguish them from other hacking motives, and the extent to which the correlates mirror research on physical acts of ideologically-motivated crime. The current study examined over 2.4 million web defacements hosted in the U.S. from 2012 to 2016 to assess aspects of routine activities theory associated with target selection and attack methods among ideologically-motivated defacements. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that ideologically-motivated defacers were more likely to use unknown vulnerabilities; engage in repeated attacks; target top-level domains linked to foreign nations; domains ending in.edu; and homepages within websites. The findings of this study suggest that the target selection process of ideologically-motivated defacers are more purposive and designed to draw attention to their cause, resembling target preferences of individuals who engage in physical violence in support of an ideological agenda.

AB  - This study provides a partial test of the relationship between actor motivations and target suitability using a routine activity framework to understand a form of cybercrime called web defacements. Specifically, the relationships between the visibility, inertia, value, and accessibility of the target in online spaces relative to the unique nonmonetary motivations of the attacker were examined. This study utilized a sample of 138,361 web defacements performed against websites hosted within the Netherlands IP space from January 2011 to April 2017. Seven multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each self-identified motive for the attack, clustered by attacker to minimize the size of standard errors. The findings demonstrated partial support for aspects of routine activity theory to account for differences in offender motivation, suggesting web defacements are similar to other forms of cybercrime. At the same time, motivations differentially shape target selection.

AB  - Research confirms what many people witness everyday—levels of crime are higher at and around some places compared to others. Explanations surrounding the spatial clustering of crime incidents, or hotspots, typically focus on characteristics of the criminal event and devote little attention to the role of the offender. Building from ideas set forth in routine activities and crime pattern theories, the first goal of this dissertation is to address this missing element. The presence of crime hotspots are estimated using geocoded crime incidents. The resulting maps, along with bivariate and multivariate analyses, examine offender-based explanations for the development of crime hotspots while taking into account social-structural and place-based explanations. The second goal of this dissertation is to examine particular hypotheses about how these three types of explanations interact to influence the spatial clustering of crime. Offense data for a sample of subjects participating in the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS) are combined with interview data, data from the 1990 Census, and the geographical locations of criminogenic places. This person-incident file is divided into four samples based on offender age. Results of logistic regression models indicate some support for offender-based explanations for the clustering of crime incidents, but only among offenders 12-15 years old. On the other hand, the effect of criminogenic places influences the spatial clustering of crime across the three age groups examined in logistic regression models. Age mediates the relationship between some measures and clustering, but otherwise there are no two- or three-way interaction effects among variables across the three levels of analysis.

AB  - This thesis explores the spatial distribution of crime in Ottawa, Canada in 2006. Crime pattern theory provides the theoretical framework for examining the relationship between the rates of burglary, robbery, and motor vehicle theft and the two universities, University of Ottawa and Carleton University. This thesis uses ArcView 3.3 software to geocode and spatially join the crime and census data, and uses GeoDa 0.9.5-i software to conduct a spatial regression procedure that accounts for spatial autocorrelation between the crime rates and socio-demographic characteristics at the dissemination area level. This thesis finds support for crime pattern theory and the geometric theory of crime, as universities are the strongest predictors of the rates of burglary and motor vehicle theft. This thesis also finds some support for both social disorganization theory and routine activity theory as a number of the expected relationships between the sociodemographic and socio-economic variables and crime are observed.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities, as measured by changes in public transport passenger numbers.MethodThe first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors.ResultsResults indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that some of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the findings suggested that the changes in mobility explain part of the declines observed, with important variations per crime type.ConclusionThe findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explicitly test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

AB  - Crime within Arabic countries is significantly different from Western crime in type, frequency, and motivation. For example, motor vehicle theft (MVT) has constituted the largest proportion of property crime incidents in Saudi Arabia (SA) for decades. This is in stark contrast to Western countries where burglary and street theft dominate. Environmental criminology theories, such as routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, have the potential to help to investigate Arabic crime. However, there is no research that has sought to evaluate the validity of these theories within such a different cultural context. This article represents a first step in addressing this substantial research gap, taking MVT within SA as a case study. We evaluate previous MVT studies using an environmental criminology approach with a critical view to applying environmental criminology to an Arabic context. The article identifies a range of key features in SA that are different from typical Western contexts. These differences could limit the appropriateness of existing methodologies used to apply environmental criminology. The study also reveals that the methodologies associated with traditional environmental crime theory need adjusting more generally when working with MVT, not least to account for shifts in the location of opportunities for crime with time.

AB  - People's movements across time and space affect crime opportunities, and in turn, are influenced by the physical environment. Facilities such as bars, shopping malls, schools, and entertainment districts for example affect routine activities and the criminal event. Such places act as crime attractors or generators. Attractors possess crime opportunities, pulling intending criminals who act on these opportunities, while generators do not necessarily draw intending criminals, but possess many opportunities resulting in crime problems. Spectator events such as hockey games draw large numbers of people and may function as crime attractors and/or generators and such impacts on crime patterns have been largely unexplored. This analysis examines the home arena of a local National Hockey League club as a possible attractor/generator. As a spectator event, this venue draws many people into Vancouver's downtown core on game nights, changing crime opportunities and the spatio-temporal distribution of crime in the downtown. Keywords: Crime attractors, crime generators, spectator events. Subject Terms: Environmental criminology, routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, rational choice theory

AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers' incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods.

AB  - The spatial analysis of crime and the current focus on hotspots has pushed the area of crime mapping to the fore, especially in regard to high volume offenses such as vehicle theft and burglary. Hotspots also have a temporal component, yet police recorded crime databases rarely record the actual time of offense as this is seldom known. Police crime data tends, more often than not, to reflect the routine activities of the victims rather than the offense patterns of the offenders. This paper demonstrates a technique that uses police START and END crime times to generate a crime occurrence probability at any given time that can be mapped or visualized graphically. A study in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, demonstrates that crime hotspots with a geographical proximity can have distinctly different temporal patterns.

AB  - The US power grid has been identified by security experts as a prime target for terrorist-based and state-sponsored cyber attacks. In addition to downing the grid, cyber attacks can also destroy and manipulate data systems, obtain sensitive intellectual property and steal trade secrets. Existing research has addressed the technical factors, such as vulnerabilities and poor intrusion detection systems, which lead to cyber attacks. However, it remains silent on the human factors in the cyber attack equation. This study uses a criminological framework, specifically Routine Activities Theory and Rational Choice Perspective to capture intelligent adversaries who plan and execute attacks based on their analysis of target suitability and guardianship efficacy. It uses a two-step methodology to identify adversary-, target-, and guardianship-specific factors that collectively impact decision-making processes. First, a document analysis of existing literature reveals nine factors (PARE RISKS) that influence adversarial decision-making: P revention measures, A ttacks and Alliances, R esults, E ase of Access, R esponse and Recovery, I nterconnectedness and Interdependencies, S ecurity Testing, Assessments and Audits, K nowledge, Skills, Research and Development, and S ystem Weaknesses. Second, surveys and interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 with various hackers, penetration testers, and power grid representatives helps validate and refine the PARE RISKS framework. This study identifies (i) adversary-specific factors as resources (skills, money, and time), and research (targets and techniques); (ii) target-specific factors as accessibility (electronic and physical) and weaknesses (outdated architecture and inadequate testing/updates); and (iii) guardian-specific factors as prevention (quality of prevention and intrusion detection measures). It argues that altering each of these three elements of Routine Activities Theory can impact adversarial decision-making, which may help reduce the likelihood of power grid cyber attacks.

AB  - Attempts at classifying sexual offenses and the persons who commit them are reviewed relative to different ways that classifications can have value. Classifying offenses continues to be a productive exercise. The diversity of novel types of offending is being mapped and the identification of psychologically meaningful behavioral themes within broad categories of offense is promising as is the application of Routine Activities theory to target selection scripts. Classifying those who commit sexual offenses, despite considerable research effort being expended in the endeavor, has turned out to be less productive with typological models being largely superseded by dimensional systems. However, the development of standardized risk classes has value for improving communication in the sub-field of actuarial risk assessment and the development of theory-based prototypes has potential for theory development.

AB  - ObjectivesTo explore spatial patterns of crime in a small northern city, and assess the degree of similarity in these patterns across seasons.MethodsCalls for police service frequently associated with crime (theft, break and enter, domestic dispute, assault, and neighbor disputes) were acquired for a five year time span (2015–2019) for the city of North Bay, Ontario, Canada (population 50,396). Exploratory data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and a kernel density mapping technique. Andresen’s spatial point pattern test (SPPT) was then used to assess the degree of similarity between the seasonal patterns (spring, summer, autumn, winter) for each call type at two different spatial scales (dissemination area and census tract).ResultsExploratory data analysis of crime concentration at street segments showed that calls are generally more dispersed through the city in the warmer seasons of spring and summer. Kernel density mapping also shows increases in the intensity of hotspots at these times, but little overall change in pattern. The SPPT does find some evidence for seasonal differences in crime pattern across the city as a whole, specifically for thefts and break and enters. These differences are focused on the downtown core, as well as the outlying rural areas of the city.ConclusionsFor the various crime types examined, preliminary analysis, kernel density mapping, and the SPPT found differences in crime pattern consistent with the routine activities theory.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to explore the feature and mechanism of a new type of documentary credit fraud that victimizes banks’ issuing letters of credit (L/C), harming neither the importer nor the exporter and seeks to suggest possible measures to tackle it. Design/methodology/approach – This study analyzed 30 cases of documentary credit fraud against banks that were detected by the Korea Customs Service (KCS) and interviewed three key customs investigators to interpret the case reports more accurately and gain a deeper understanding into the mechanisms governing the fraud. This study draws on routine activity theory and crime pattern theory to analyze the opportunity structures of this fraud. Findings – This study found that the importer that engaged in the fraud cases had established a solid business relationship with the exporter and had established trust with the victimized banks; the banks, despite the fact that they had their own risk management systems to screen out unqualified L/C applicants, were defrauded by the offending importers and exporters. Unlike ordinary documentary credit fraud, fraud against banks can be tackled by customs because the offender and the victim typically operate in the same jurisdiction, and this type of fraud often results in trade-based capital flight and money laundering, which is the target of customs enforcement. Research limitations/implications – As this paper is based on case reports of the KCS, it is inappropriate to generalize the findings or to apply the findings to other contexts. Nevertheless, the opportunity structure elaborated upon in the course of this paper may prove useful in devising measures to tackle this type of fraud elsewhere. Originality/value – Documentary credit fraud against banks is relatively unexplored, in particular from criminological perspective. This study can contribute to a refinement of the application of opportunity perspective to white-collar crime.

AB  - Extant research has provided support for the micro‐level predictions of rational choice models of crime. Yet, a central feature of the rational choice perspective in the broader social sciences—that it is multilevel in focus, situating individuals within broader community social structures—has been neglected within criminology. In this article, we discuss and test a model that links community structural characteristics to several individual expectations and preferences relevant to crime. Using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, we find that objective levels of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage influence individuals’ perceptions of, and preferences for, the risks, costs, and rewards associated with offending indirectly by affecting perceived disorder and perceived opportunities for legitimate avenues of success within one's neighborhood. The implications of a multilevel rational choice model of offending are discussed.

AB  -  This is an exploratory investigation into the relevancy of five micro-criminological theories to American college students' self-reported shoplifting (willful concealment) experience. A 146-item Likert-style questionnaire was voluntarily completed by non-randomly selected male and female undergraduates (N=259) at four American universities. From this sample, 166 reported having shoplifted. The survey items were inspired by Akers and Sellers' social learning theory, Sykes and Matza's techniques of neutralization, Gottfredson and Hirschi's selfcontrol theory, Cornish and Clarke's rational choice theory, and Cohen and Felson's routine activity theory. Through factor analysis, 12 factors were developed, two or three for each theory. The results support these theories, but only certain elements of them seemed relevant to our data. We also found that self-control theory and rational choice theory were more relevant to low frequency shoplifters (one or two times), and social learning theory and routine activities theory were more associated with higher frequency shoplifters (three and more-than-three times).

AB  - Alfred Adler is often introduced and discussed incorrectly as one of Freud's students and as a psychoanalytic theorist in criminology and psychology textbooks. While thinkers such as Freud and Jung theorize about crime in tangential ways, as almost an afterthought to their accounts of neurosis and personality, Alfred Adler was one of the few pioneers in the history of psychology who had an actual theory of crime. Yet, Adler's writings on crime, its causes and assumptions have been largely overlooked in contemporary research. While Adler espoused the view that crime represents a "useless" response to the social demands of life, we argue that Adler's theory of crime presupposes a rational choice model of criminal behavior, thus mirroring the Classical School perspective on crime. This paper provides a synthesis and a critique of Alfred Adler's theory of crime. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178915000890]

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The rise in prescription drug abuse is changing crime patterns among drug users and the structure of illegal drug markets. The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. This study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. The findings of this study indicate that individual-level characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

AB  - Child sexual abuse (CSA) is increasingly described by government agencies and academic commentators as a public health problem. A range of theories has been put forward to explain different aspects, or perspectives, of child sexual abuse. These include free-standing theories such as implicit theories, rational choice, routine activities and social learning theories. Integrated theories have also been developed in an attempt to explain the individual actions of those engaging in CSA and the social ecology within which it takes place. Epicrim is an emerging criminological theory that seeks to re-conceptualize crime as a public health issue and adopts a cross-disciplinary approach that is rooted in public health strategies. Here, epicrim was applied to the issue of CSA to see whether the theory is effective at explaining its commission and consequences across both individual and societal levels. Existing theories were integrated into the resulting epicrimiological model, where appropriate. A number of existing and proposed policies aimed at preventing or addressing CSA were evaluated against the resulting epicriminological model of CSA. Policy reform suggestions were made where deficits were identified.

AB  - Individuals with disabilities experience victimization at rates higher than their typically-functioning peers. Because they are often perceived as unreliable reporters, the likelihood that victimizations of individuals with disabilities are reported is low. Data regarding the lived victimization experiences of individuals with specific disabilities are scant. Grounded in the rational choice theory and Cohen and Felson’s routine activity theory, this qualitative study investigated the victimization experiences of school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the rural Southern US. This study involved 21 public school students between the ages of 12 and 17 who were interviewed using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire, second revision. Multiple themes were extricated from interview data through descriptive coding. Students with autism are most likely to be victimized in areas that are unstructured and have inadequate supervision. When a weapon was used during victimization, it was most often a weapon of opportunity, and types of victimization most experienced by students involved chasing, grabbing, or being forced to do something they did not want to do. This study identified fear of punishment and embarrassment as the most considerable barriers to self-reporting victimizations to appropriate authorities. This study’s results can be used by families, educators, and service providers to assist in supporting change for individuals with autism that are at risk for experiencing victimization. Study data may have a positive social impact by preventing victimization through the identification of potential victims, providing situational intervention in high risk areas, and supporting intervention in situations involving victimization for individuals with autism

Anticipated shame states due to exposure reduced shoplifting intentions.  Findings support the rational choice model of offending and indicate the effects of shame are important components in individuals' decisions to offend.

AB  - This article employs Routine Activities and Crime Pattern theories to explore the factors that lead to increased risk of bike theft, focusing on Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority Metrorail (Metro) property. Utilizing the Metro bike census and other data, we use negative binomial regression analysis to model the relationship between bike thefts and various station- and neighborhood-level risk factors that can either create or close off opportunities for bike thefts. The findings indicate that bike thefts around Metro stations are positively influenced by the number of targets, as measured by the number of bikes per station, and the presence of likely offenders, as measured by the volume of auto-related larcenies. Stations that have greater guardianship, as measured by the number of nearby businesses, are less likely to experience bike theft. The implications of these findings for theory, methodological considerations, and crime prevention are discussed. We suggest that bike racks can be placed in locations with greater informal guardianship, and discuss ways our findings can inform traditional interventions such as bike locking campaigns.

AB  - The added value of criminological perspectives in terrorism research. XxxTerrorism could be regarded as an extreme type of (violent) criminal behaviour. Against this background, there is much to gain if criminological attention would be extended to terrorism. In this overview, the authors describe how and to what extent criminological theories may provide a significant contribution to underlying causes of terrorism. Previous criminological contributions to the field of terrorism have primarily taken a theory-extended approach, including routine activity theory, rational choice theory and strain theory. However, so far such studies lacked empirical data. Further, to this day, not much is known about the empirical applicability of other criminological theories, including desistance theories, which warrant particular attention. In order for criminology literature to contribute effectively to our understanding of terrorism and to pursue better counter-terrorism policies, empirical evidence should first be obtained. In this way, terrorism researchers, in close collaboration with criminologists, can deepen our theoretical and empirical understanding of this relatively underexplored field.

AB  - Traditional studies of deterrence and rational choice processes included “formal” or “legal” sanctions (i.e., arrest, conviction, and incarceration) meant to influence the likelihood of whether people will engage in criminal or deviant acts. More recent studies include these formal sanctions as well as a limited range of “informal” or “extra-legal” sanctions which also appear to have some influence on decisions to participate, or not participate, in criminal or deviant behavior. Informal sanctions typically incorporated in studies of deterrence and rational choice processes include shame (or self-stigma), embarrassment, attachment costs, commitment costs, material rewards, and loss of respect of significant others. Recent research on emotional states suggest that affective responses to the commission of crimes may also affect people's likelihood of offending. However, the existing literature of rational choice models of offending is devoid of studies which integrate formal, informal, and affective costs and/or benefits. Also, very little research has been done which addresses gender differences in the rational choice processes. The female inmate population is the fastest growing population in the U.S. correctional system. This is especially true in the Mississippi prison system, where the female inmate population is expected to increase three-fold between 1996 and 2006, and where the average length of stay for female inmates is expected to increase by more than fifty percent during this same decade. Because of these increases, more attention must be given to this unique population by researchers, particularly in the area of deterrence. Results from a survey of 726 incarcerated offenders (363 males and 363 females) in a Mississippi Correctional facility explore the effect of formal, informal, and affective reinforcers on inmates' self-reported likelihood of re-offending after release. Results contribute to the eventual development of a more comprehensive, integrated model of rational choice that includes a variety of costs and benefits, and offer support for the consideration of gender differences in deterrence and rational choice models.

AB  - This dissertation examines the relationships between three specific types of places, including high schools, on-premise alcohol outlets, and Turkish coffeehouses, and crime on Turkish streetblocks.  Its theoretical framework is grounded in an environmental criminology approach.  Research hypotheses are derived from an integration of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, social disorganization theory, and multilevel criminal opportunity theory.  For each of the target places, (high schools, on-premise alcohol outlets, Turkish coffeehouses), it is hypothesized that as the number of the target places (e.g., high schools) on a streetblock increases, the number of crimes also increases on that streetblock.  Further, this relationship is hypothesized to be moderated by neighborhood level social disorganization variables.  The data for this research come from four different sources.  The crime data come from the Bursa Police Department, Turkey.  The locations of crime incidents and places are plotted on electronic maps of streetblocks and neighborhoods of Bursa.  The map files, including the maps of high schools and on-premise alcohol outlets, come from the Bursa Police Department as well.  The locations of Turkish coffeehouses come from the Bursa Chamber of Commerce/Coffeehouses.  Neighborhood level social disorganization variables come from the Turkish Statistical Institution.  The LandScan 2008 Dataset is used to construct a measure of population at risk.  The data are analyzed using the multilevel multivariate Poisson modeling (HGLM) technique (Raudenbush and Earl 2002).  The research hypotheses are tested for total crimes, as well as for specific types of crime (i.e., violent crime, burglary, theft, auto-theft, and theft from auto).  The results of the analyses indicate that, overall, as the number of target places (e.g., high schools) increases on a streetblock, the number of crimes also increases.  The strength of this relationship varies by the type of place (i.e., it is strongest in on-premise alcohol outlets models and weakest in high schools models) and the type of crime.  This relationship is also moderated by neighborhood social disorganization.  More specifically, overall, neighborhood heterogeneity and economic disadvantage strengthens, and neighborhood instability and family disruption weakens the relationship.  Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed.  There are several limitations of this research.  These include problems regarding the temporal ordering of the variables and technical issues regarding the map files (i.e., ambiguity regarding some streetblocks, boundary streets, locations of crime incidents and business places), and limited measures of business places and indicators of social disorganization variables.  Possible effects of these limitations on the findings are discussed.  With these limitations in mind, this study shows that a multilevel criminal opportunity theory is generalizable to Turkish streetblocks and neighborhoods.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between land use, walkability, and the outcomes of neighborhood crime rates of larceny and aggravated assault. We use a combination of OLS regression models, harmonic analysis of diurnal patterns, and geospatial statistical techniques to examine the spatial patterning of larceny and aggravated assault in 782 Census blocks in Miami-Dade County, Florida with long-term data from 2007 to 2015. The results show that neighborhoods (i.e., Census block clusters) with higher levels of walkability have greater levels of aggravated assault. We also find that the increasing land-use diversity increases both aggravated assault and larceny. Finally, aggravated assault peaks during late night hours, while larceny peaks during daytime hours. Based on the results of our study using conventional and geospatial analyses, routine activity and social disorganization theories of neighborhood crime are partially supported, in that more motivated offenders and potential targets increase crime rates, while increased guardianship and informal social control reduce crime rates. The results of this study have important implications for security experts, law-enforcement agencies, and urban planning policy specialists focused on reducing crime in metropolitan areas. It is also relevant for theoretical frameworks designed to explain and predict temporal and spatial crime patterning.

AB  - ObjectivesWe aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences.MethodsThe data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services.ResultsThe results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders.ConclusionsBy replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.

AB  - American criminological theory and research has traditionally focused on individual offenders. Beginning in the 1970s, however, macro-level (or “ecological”) theory and research emerged (or “re-emerged”) and has since earned sustained criminological attention. Prompted by the development of routine activities theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979), the seminal work of Blau and Blau (1982) on inequality and violent crime, the rediscovery of social disorganization theory by contemporary scholars (e.g., see Bursik, 1986, 1988; Sampson and Groves, 1989; Wilson, 1990, 1996), and a renewed interest in macro-level deterrence-rational choice theory (Becker, 1968, 1978), over 200 empirical studies have since been conducted and published in academic journals in an effort to uncover the correlates of aggregate levels of crime. Despite the theoretical and empirical advances made in this area over the last couple of decades, there has been a dearth of efforts to synthesize and “make sense” of the existing body of scholarship. The present study subjected the body of macro-level criminological literature to a “meta-analysis”—or “quantitative synthesis”—to determine the relative effects of the various macro-level predictors of crime assessed across empirical studies. Particular attention was paid to the variables specified by seven major macro-level theories of crime: social disorganization theory, anomie/strain theory, absolute deprivation/conflict theory, relative deprivation/inequality theory, routine activities theory, rational choice/deterrence theory, social support/altruism theory, and subcultural theory. The results indicate that macro-level indicators of “concentrated disadvantage” are among the strongest and most stable predictors of crime across empirical studies. These include racial heterogeneity (measured as the percent non-white and/or the percent black ), poverty, and family disruption. Conversely, variables related to criminal justice system dynamics (e.g.,  policing effects, the effects of “get tough” policies) are among the most consistently weak predictors of crime. Overall, these analyses indicate that social disorganization and absolute deprivation/conflict theories have received strong empirical support across existing studies; anomie/strain, social support/altruism, relative deprivation/inequality, and routine activities theories have received a moderate degree of empirical support; and, deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories are weakly supported by the body of empirical literature. Finally, the implications of the analysis for future research and public policy development are discussed.

AB  - A major public concern is what to do with sex offenders. This seven-year study utilizes first-hand accounts from sex offenders who pursue children, exploring recruitment methods – that is, how they find and gain access to victims. Much public perception about sex offender recruitment is based on well-publicized cases such as that of Polly Klaas, Megan Kanka, and Jaycee Dugard – young girls who were abducted and, in the case of Klaas and Kanka, murdered, by strangers. Legislative efforts responded with laws such as "three strikes" and sex offender registries. Scientific studies have found such laws to be ineffective, yet heightened media exposure persists, perception of "stranger danger" prevails, and untried legislative initiatives continue. The most recent is "buffer zone" laws that limit where sex offenders live. To better inform perception and policy, this study investigates two samples of sex offenders concerning child recruitment. The first sample targeted a general population of sex offenders in state custody with a determinate sentence. The second focused on a population of sexually violent predators (SVP), as defined by Kansas law, constituting repeat offenders with a long history of sex offenses and/or those deemed legislatively as unfit for release into the community. The bulk of data came through interviews addressing activities that surrounded the offense(s), details of child recruitment, and, pertaining to the SVP sample, how offending corresponded with certain life events. Theoretically, the study is informed by Routine Activities Theory (RAT) and Life-Course Theory (LCT). RAT is based on a rational choice perspective of motivation and opportunity – an individualistic approach – while LCT sees offending episodes as strongly influenced by structural position. These two seemingly divergent theories represent a unique framework referred to here as conditioned activities, demonstrating how routine activities are altered by certain life events, or turning points, which, in turn, influence persistence or desistence in offending. It was discovered that child victim recruitment varies across the life course, specifically tied to changes in the offender's social position. Age of the offender interacts with both position and life events.

AB  - My dissertation demonstrates sex differences in offending over the life course with a flexible model on the age-crime curve using a longitudinal dataset, and examines the causal role of childbirth in the process of desistance for both sexes.   It is well documented that females offend with less prevalence and lower frequency than males. Scholars also find that the developmental patterns of change are very similar across sexes. Yet, most of the research at this point has focused on process of onset, rather than the post onset or desistance process.  This is important because recidivism research using official data shows clearly that females have lower recidivism rates than males; thus they possibly exit crime at an earlier point than do males. Laub and Sampson (2001) argued that males move away from crime more gradually compared to females. In the first study of my dissertation, I present evidence examining the age-crime patterns for arrest and criminal behavior use for males and females separately using the NLSY97.  I use a very flexible estimation method - spline regression - that allows the different phases of the curve to be estimated independently. Disaggregated curves are also presented and discussed using Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM). Implications are discussed for the direction of understanding the process.   Following Kreager et al. (2010), I then test the effect of childbirth on criminal behaviors during the transition into adulthood. Childbirth is a gendered activity; it transforms the identity of both parents but possibly in different ways for men and women. Some evidence shows that this event can be regarded as an important inhibitor in opportunities of crime involvement influencing the routine activities of a female delinquent. In the second part of my dissertation study, I examine the role of childbirth on crime for both sexes. Using the same dataset, I will compare the effect of this particular set of life events and demonstrate whether and how the entering of parenthood influences the deviant paths, potentially differently by sex.

AB  - This article aims to review empirical research on residential burglary over the last three to four decades and relate these findings to a model of 'dysfunctional expertise' (Nee & Ward, this issue) that is rooted in mainstream cognitive psychology. It begins with a description of the elements of expertise that might fit in to this model and then traces the offender's decision-chain, using the model as an explanatory tool. Studies have shed light on: the automatic and habitual appraisal of the criminogenic environment during the daily, routine activities of the burglar and his journey to crime; accruing situational awareness and automatic recognition of cues signifying vulnerable properties during target selection; and speedy deployment of offending scripts based on tried and tested methods when entering and carrying out the crime. The review highlights how little is known about decisions, reflections and emotions after the crime. Aspects of the model that require development through further research, as well as the value of using the model for crime prevention purposes, are discussed.

AB  -  Since its original publication, routine activity theory has proven most instructive for understanding temporal patterns in crime. The most prominent of the temporal crime patterns investigated is seasonality: crime (most often assault) increases during the summer months and decreases once routine activities are less often outside. Despite the rather widespread literature on the seasonality of crime, there is very little research investigating temporal patterns of crime at shorter time intervals such as within the week or even within the day. This paper contributes to this literature through a spatial-temporal analysis of crime patterns for different days of the week. It is found that temporal patterns are present for different days of the week (more crime on weekends, as would be expected) and there is a spatial component to that temporal change. Specifically, aside from robbery and sexual assault at the micro-spatial unit of analysis (street segments) the spatial patterns of crime changed. With regard to the spatial pattern changes, we found that assaults and theft from vehicle had their spatial patterns change in predictable ways on Saturdays: assaults increased in the bar district and theft from vehicles increased in the downtown and recreational car park areas.

AB  - PurposeIn the field of crime prevention there are several theoretical approaches explaining why crime occurs and how to prevent it. Three of them – routine activity theory, crime pattern theory and the theory of crime-as-choice – are logically tested in this work. The point of departure is to test if the theories are logical consistent and logical valid, irrespective of whether the criterion for criminal intent is changed from direct intention to negligence.Design/methodology/approachThe issues will be explored in a logical structure by a first-order logic propositional analysis.FindingsThe analysis shows that all three theories are logical consistent, but only routine activity theory is logical valid. The conclusion is that crime prevention should in general assume that routine activity theory is the legitimate theory and that social prevention as a prevention strategy is logically unnecessary to adopt because it does not matter whether the offender is motivated (direct intention) or not (negligence).Practical implicationsIt does not really matter if the authors theoretically treat white-collar offenders as motivated, because if they have committed an actus reus, they are an offender according to the objective requisites. This means that the best strategies to prevent a potential white-collar criminal are situational prevention, i.e. complicate their access to money, where it becomes irrelevant if the potential offender has a mens rea or not. What counts is the prevention of actus reus by a potential offender.Originality/valueAs far as I know, no one has previously investigated the logical consistency and/or logical validity of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory and the theory of crime-as-choice as theories of crime prevention.

AB  - The legalization of medical marijuana remains a controversial policy. An important dimension of marijuana legalization is the siting of dispensaries and their influence on a surrounding community. Specifically, dispensaries, if they engender criminogenic opportunities via changes in routine activities, have the potential to increase crimes in the areas surrounding medicinal marijuana dispensaries (MMDs). Using a quasi-experimental design, we examine the relationship between MMDs and crime using micro-spatial units in a novel location. Street level geocoded crime data for violent and nonviolent crime patterns before and after the opening of MMD’s in Washington, D.C. Crime is analyzed with 100 m buffers around each dispensary and control location drawn from propensity score matching. Differences between crime rates pre- and postoperation are compared. With the exception of one location, crime decreased or remained constant in geographical areas following the opening of a dispensary. MMDs do not appear to have an immediate criminogenic effect. Implications for future research regarding potential confounding factors and data limitations are discussed.

AB  - ObjectivesTest the reliability of geotagged Twitter data for estimating block-level population metrics across place types. Evaluate whether the proportion of Twitter users on a block at a given time who are local residents, inter-metro commuters, or tourists is correlated with incidences of public violence and private conflict for four different time periods: weekday days, weekday nights, weekend days, and weekend nights.MethodsDBSCAN* machine learning technique is used to estimate the home clusters of 54,249 Twitter users who sent at least one geotagged tweet in Boston. Public violence and private conflict are measured using geocoded 911 dispatches. ANOVA models are used to evaluate how the presence of our three groups of interests varies across three types of block-level land usage. Hierarchical linear regression models are used to evaluate whether the proportion of commuters and tourists at census tract- and block-levels are predictive of crime events across the four time periods of interest.ResultsWe find evidence that Twitter data has limited reliability across residential blocks due to data sparseness. For non-residential blocks, we find that commuter and tourist presence at the block-level are positively associated with both public violence and private conflict, but that these effects are not stable across time periods. Commuters and tourists only effect violence during weekday days, and the effects of commuters and tourists on private conflict are only statistically significant during weekday days and weekend days.ConclusionsConsistent with routine activities and crime pattern theories, the influx of outsiders in a given location impacts the likelihood of crime occurring there. While we find that data from Twitter users can be valuable for measuring block-level ambient populations, it appears this is not true for residential blocks. Future research may further consider how the characteristics of Twitter users may inform spatial patterns in crime.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Self-Policing Policy (more commonly referred to as the Audit Policy) waives or reduces penalties when regulated entities voluntarily discover, disclose, and correct environmental violations. This study draws upon a rational choice model of corporate crime to determine if traditional regulatory efforts such as inspections and enforcement actions are associated with the odds of disclosing an environmental violation under the Audit Policy. A case control design is used to compare companies that self-police to companies that do not self-police. The event group consists of all 551 companies that disclosed at least one environmental violation under the Audit Policy between October 1, 1998 and September 30, 2000. The control group consists of a simple random sample of 551 companies that did not use the Audit Policy but were discovered to have violated at least one environmental law during the same time period as the event group. There is no evidence that inspections and enforcement increase Audit Policy use. However, the results do suggest, first, that the Audit Policy is more likely to be used by large companies than by small companies and, second, that it is likely to be used for reporting violations as opposed to more serious emissions or permit violations. In terms of public policy these findings suggest that regulatory agencies such as the EPA can do relatively little to increase the self-policing of environmental violations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Do people think about offending risk in verbal or numerical terms? Does the elicitation method affect reported subjective probabilities? Rational choice models require potential outcomes (e.g., benefits/costs) to be weighted by their probability of occurrence. Indeed, the subjective likelihood of being apprehended is the central construct in criminological deterrence theory—the so-called certainty principle. Yet, extant literature has measured the construct inconsistently and with little attention to potential consequences. Using a series of randomized experiments conducted with nationwide samples of American adults (aged 18 and over), this study examines the degree of correspondence between verbal and numeric measures of apprehension risk, assesses the durability of numeric estimates specifically, and attempts to elicit how respondents naturally think about apprehension risk. The findings suggest that laypeople are somewhat inconsistent in their use of both verbal and numeric descriptors of probability, their numeric estimates of probability are unlikely to be precise or durable, and many seem to prefer thinking of risk in verbal terms (compared to numeric terms). Researchers should consider including both verbal and numeric measures of probability and explore alternative measurement strategies, including anchoring vignettes, which have been valuable in standardizing verbal responses in other disciplines.

AB  - ObjectivesRandom police patrol, which spreads resources in an unfocused way across a city, remains a dominant strategy despite widespread acceptance that it is ineffective at preventing crime. Research also suggests that patrol officers could make better use of unallocated time if they were to engage in hot spots policing rather than random patrol. Paired with knowledge that police officers have a considerable amount of unallocated patrol time, it may be a relatively untapped resource with substantial crime prevention potential.MethodsThe present study employs an agent-based model informed by routine activity and rational choice theories to simulate whether significant reductions in street robbery can be achieved if officers increase dosage of police presence at hot spots during their unallocated patrol time rather than randomly patrolling a large geographic area.ResultsThe findings suggest that if departments achieve one-third of a patrol officer’s time be dedicated to proactive activities, substantial crime reductions in a large geographic area may be obtained.ConclusionsPotential savings can be realized using existing resources if police are able to increase the portion of time officers engage in hot spots policing, and police departments should make staffing and hiring decisions that maintain necessary levels of downtime.

AB  - Purpose – The study intends to determine the impact of the lockdowns during the COVID-19 on various categories of crime. It examines the issue of crime in Israel focusing on the crime patterns that evolve separately among Jews and Arabs.Methodology/Approach – Using statistical data received from the Israeli police, the authors examined crime rates during the lockdown periods, compared to the same period three years before.Findings – The findings in this study are in line with other studies, meaning that the impact of lockdowns on crime during the pandemic, especially on violence and domestic violence, is not conclusive. As far as severe violence is concerned, in the first lockdown the impact was more pronounced. However, the subsequent lockdowns produced less dramatic outcomes. A close examination of the data implies that during the lockdowns, the oscillations of violence rates were more noticeable among the Arab population.Originality/Value – The effect of the lockdowns corroborated much of the findings in previous studies done in other countries. The findings follow the theory of routine activity and shaw that when life returned to normal also the crime patters returned to the old patterns. Furthermore, it seems that many subsequent lockdowns lose their effectiveness as people find ways to avoid some of the restrictions. In addition, also when some effect was noticed, it certainly is not very dramatic.

AB  - Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

AB  - This research attempts to elaborate a routine activity model of violent victimization by incorporating an explicit rational choice perspective on potential targets' decision making to avoid violent encounters. We propose chat the costs associated with a violent attack and the probability of offender retaliation depend on whether the offender's targeting strategy is opportunistic or deliberate-a function of the relational distance between the offender and target. Specifically, we propose that victim efforts to limit exposure to an offender may motivate a violent retaliatory response when the victim and offender are intimates compared to when they are strangers. We develop hypotheses based on these ideas and test them using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (1992-2000). The results suggest that female targets are more sensitive to an offender's targeting strategy than are males. We conclude with a discussion of how knowledge of the potential risk of violent retaliation on the part of intimate and spousal offenders can be used to create more efficacious policies to protect victims of violence.

AB  - Community and problem-oriented policing have shaped the debate over the role of the American police for three decades. In the 1990s, the federal government provided billions of dollars via the COPS program to promote police reform. During this time, community and problem-solving practices became more common. Research focusing specifically on whether COPS grants directly resulted in reductions in crime remains mixed. Two archetypes of community policing can be identified, each rooted in a different neighborhood theory of crime: broken windows theory and social disorganization theory. Problem-oriented policing draws on theories of criminal opportunity, such as routine activity and rational choice theory, to direct interventions aimed at altering environmental conditions to reduce crime and disorder. The weight of the empirical evidence is that community and problem-oriented policing can reduce crime and disorder. Many important questions require systematic investigation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

The discussion opens with definitions of child pornography, child erotica, child exploitation material and paedophilia. Its main objective is to promote online protection of children. It is explained that online child sex offenders and paedophiles use the Internet to create virtual communities; collect, share and trade images; tempt, seduce and groom children. Then the article explores what has been done in the Western world to combat those criminal activities. Successful campaigns against child pornography require shared responsibility and effort by parents, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), legal enforcement and the international community at large.

The closest approach to a comprehensive effort from the Spergel Model is the gang injunction, an area still dominated by the rational choice model, which does not address the underlying existence of criminal enterprises.\n One can also expect a degree of resistance from those who wish to prolong the status quo due to their positions of authority and their psychological investment in a system that has provided for their individual success - hardly the hotbed of demand for change.

However, it remains unclear whether the relationship between schools and crime is a reflection of other criminogenic dynamics at the neighborhood level or whether schools influence neighborhood crime patterns independently of other established structural predictors. We address this question by investigating the relationship between schools and serious crime at the block group level while controlling for the potentially criminogenic effects of neighborhood instability and structural disadvantage. We find that, net of other structural correlates, neighborhoods with high schools and middle schools experience more violent, property, and narcotics crimes than those without middle or high schools. Conversely, neighborhoods with elementary schools exhibit less property crime than those not containing elementary schools. These results, which are consistent with prior research and with explanations derived from the routine activities and social disorganization perspectives, suggest some strategies for police deployment and community involvement to control crime.

AB  - The book is divided into three parts that provide readers with a (i) basic foundation in core concepts of environmental criminology (for example, crime patterns), (ii) a review of the theories within the framework (for example, routine activity theory) and (iii) a discussion of issues related to its practical application (for example, measurement).  [...]while not at all problematic, it is also worth mentioning that much of the research used throughout the text to illustrate key points was either conducted in Canada or the author's own work.  [...]those intimately familiar with the larger environmental criminology literature may be left somewhat dissatisfied by the absence of research from other countries.

AB  - We study the emergence of new forms of law violations in Latin America during the coronavirus pandemic. Based on data from online news articles, we construct a typology of “new” crimes: (1) hate or fear crimes against health workers and hospitals; (2) illegal denials of public mobility out of fear of infection; (3) looting and other traditional crimes justified by the pandemic; and (4) violations of pandemic regulations. Studies of crime during the pandemic have focused on traditional crime and have been based on rational choice theory and a routine activities approach. We argue that in order to understand the recent crime trends in Latin America, these must be accompanied by other theories of crime, together with a better understanding of the role of the State. Our typology can be a starting point for discussions and further research on the complex relationship between criminal behavior and policy responses in pandemics.

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender—Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available." [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  -  Behaviour, including criminal behaviour, takes place in lived contexts of embodied action and experience. The way in which abstract models of selfhood efface the individual as a unique, living being is a central aspect of the 'ethical-other' debate; if an individual is modelled as abstracted from this 'living' context, that individual cannot be properly or meaningfully linked with his or her behaviour, and thus cannot justly be understood as responsible. The dominant rational choice models of criminal identity in legal theory involve at least a partial abstraction of this 'unethical' type by prioritising the rational will over the more fluid dimensions of lived reality. From a phenomenological perspective, an approach of 'restlessness' is proposed which precludes the development of settled or general abstract categories, and can thus move us closer to an ethical understanding of living individuals on a theoretical level. Although such a move may initially seem to threaten criminal justice with an irrational nihilism, by maintaining awareness of the irreducibility of 'living' reality a restless theoretical understanding of moral selfhood may be able to shape or underpin the attribution of responsibility in more practical or substantive contexts without succumbing to meaninglessness.

AB  - The poaching of wildlife has been a concern to many involved in the protection of wildlife. Poaching is found throughout the world and has been around for thousands of years. In the past century, poaching has reached new heights and the concern of an extinction of a species has bought the topic of poaching to new light. Whilst poaching has been seen as a biological or conservation topic in the past, criminologists around the world have now started to delve into the topic. The poaching of wildlife and more so in recent years, rhino poaching, has been a concern in South Africa. South Africa has seen an increase in rhino poaching in the past 8 years, where over 4,000 rhinos have been slaughtered. This research aims to give insight into the current rhino-poaching epidemic in South Africa and looks at the problem from a criminological point of view, where possible solutions can be recommend using criminological theories for the prevention of rhino poaching.

AB  - Most research, drawing on deterrence and rational choice models of social action, examines the effects of reductions of blood alcohol concentration [BAC] limits to secure drunk driving convictions on the total volume of crash fatalities. This paper extends this work by investigating the impact of New Jersey’s BAC legislation on total and disaggregated crash fatalities. The results from the interrupted times series analyses show that reducing the BAC limit to 0.8 has no effect on total or driver fatalities, but has a negative and lasting effect on passenger fatalities. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between student perceptions of university police and fear of crime through the utilization of a rational choice perspective. Over the last three decades, a plethora of research has explored fear of crime and factors related to its occurrence. However, a thorough review of the literature revealed a limited amount of studies that have examined the impact that fear of crime has on college students. Moreover, no studies were uncovered that utilize rational choice theory to examine whether student perceptions of university police influence their fear. This study attempts to address this shortcoming and therefore add to the fear of crime literature. For purposes of data collection, a survey methodology and two probability sampling techniques were utilized. Sections of various general education and elective liberal studies courses were randomly selected and students within these courses were given a survey to complete. Survey questions examined several factors that can impact fear, and these factors were guided by past fear of crime research. Responses were coded and entered into a statistical software program for analysis. The results revealed empirical support for several fear of crime correlates, including gender, living arrangement, race, perceived risk of victimization and police visibility. Policy implications and suggestions for future research are discussed to conclude the study.
