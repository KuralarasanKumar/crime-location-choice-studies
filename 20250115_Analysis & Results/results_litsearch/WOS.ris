AB  - This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders.
   Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age.
   Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders.
   This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.

AB  - This article studies how burglars select a house to burglarize. We draw on the rational choice perspective to investigate how burglars select a target by relying on house-related attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk. It extends current applications of the discrete spatial choice framework to burglary target selection by adopting the house as the spatial unit of analysis and studies burglars' target selection process in a larger and more diverse study area than that of earlier studies. Using data on 650 residential burglaries and on approximately 500,000 residential properties in the Belgian province East Flanders, we consider a discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection to establish which house-related attributes influence burglars' target selection process. Our findings demonstrate that terraced houses, houses without a garage, houses that have not been outfitted with a central heating and/or air-conditioning system and houses nearby burglars' residences are more likely to be selected. Overall, our analysis suggests that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets while higher perceived rewards actually decrease the odds of a house being burglarized. Risk-related attributes are unimportant for burglars' target choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders' knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders' pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members' home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge-where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities-and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.

AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: the extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders.

AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature.

AB  - Employing a quantitative technique on a large sample size (N=4996), this study aimed to understand spatial and temporal distribution of terrorist incidents in Istanbul, Turkey by a specific focus on targets. Rational choice, crime pattern, social disorganization, and routine activity theories covered the theoretical background. A number of determinants of terrorist incidents were tested on terrorists' target selection. Week days, type of offences, and type of terrorist organizations were found to have an important impact on target selection. Some terrorist groups, several types of offences and weekend days were found to be determinative on specific targets. Theories that were used to examine the relationship between target selection and other variables were statistically supported. In this regard, current study not only made an invaluable contribution to discussed theories in general, but also offered some practical solutions for law enforcement and public administration agencies.

AB  - Objectives The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders' choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders' pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members' homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders' activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders' prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders' spatial decision making.

AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection.

We examine crime scripts, key characteristics of targeted businesses, and the relationship between input criminal effort and output financial benefit. Results indicate that whilst all CEO-frauds are conducted online, most of the fraudulent contracts and ghost invoices are undertaken via offline means. Both Routine Activity Theory and Rational Choice Model are evidenced-fraudsters clearly take the business size and seasonality into account, and the input criminal effort and output criminal benefit are positively correlated. Having vigilant employees is evidenced as the most effective way of fraud prevention, both online and offline.

AB  - Objectives To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars' choice of residence to burglarize. Methods We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars' target choice in a conditional logit model. Results Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars' target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.

AB  - This study investigates target selection scripts of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sex crimes on stranger victims. Using latent class analysis, three target selection scripts were identified based on the victim's activities prior to the crime, each presenting two different tracks: (1) the Home script, which includes the (a) intrusion track and the (b) invited track, (2) the Outdoor script, which includes the (a) noncoercive track and the (b) coercive track, and (3) the Social script, which includes the (a) onsite track and the (b) off-site track. The scripts identified appeared to be used by both sexual aggressors of children and sexual aggressors of adults. In addition, a high proportion of crime switching was found among the identified scripts, with half of the 72 offenders switching scripts at least once. The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed.

AB  - Objectives Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender's spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.

AB  - This is the first study to apply a discrete choice model to understand terrorist spatial decision making. The findings support the proposition that terrorists make decisions that are guided by rationality and act in a similar way to urban criminals. A conditional logistic regression ascertained which characteristics increased the likelihood that an area would be selected as a target, using a dataset of attacks carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Belfast over a twenty-year period. An increase in distance from the terrorises home to the attack site decreased the likelihood that an area would be chosen and an area was more likely to be chosen if it contained a major road, police station or military base.

AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers' crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers' crime location choices, but not native robbers'. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

AB  - ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender's home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

AB  - Objectives: This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions.
   Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments.
   Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions.
   Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.

AB  - This study provides a partial test of the relationship between actor motivations and target suitability using a routine activity framework to understand a form of cybercrime called web defacements. Specifically, the relationships between the visibility, inertia, value, and accessibility of the target in online spaces relative to the unique nonmonetary motivations of the attacker were examined. This study utilized a sample of 138,361 web defacements performed against websites hosted within the Netherlands IP space from January 2011 to April 2017. Seven multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each self-identified motive for the attack, clustered by attacker to minimize the size of standard errors. The findings demonstrated partial support for aspects of routine activity theory to account for differences in offender motivation, suggesting web defacements are similar to other forms of cybercrime. At the same time, motivations differentially shape target selection.

AB  - Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders' crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times.
   Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.
   Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime.
   Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.

AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction.

AB  - Using a comprehensive victimization survey data set, we develop the first test of routine activity (RA) theory in a Latin American country. Estimating a complementary log-log multilevel model of the theory in several stages, we investigate what factors in the theory predict residential burglary risk. We find that measures associated with the exposure to potential offenders, target attractiveness, target accessibility, personal guardianship, social guardianship, and natural guardianship predict residential burglary in our sample of Mexican cities. As such, residential burglary is a complex crime with multiple factors at play, for which RA theory is a suitable theory given the conciseness of its propositions and operational definitions. We foresee RA theory successfully influencing future studies of crime in the Latin American region.

AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders' previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders' knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location's crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies.

AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. in addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness.

AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.

AB  - Visibly deterring potential adversaries is central to security risk assessment and planning operations within many agencies including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Many visible security elements are employed by TSA toward these goals. Questions remain whether these elements deter/displace attackers, and answers are elusive in these data-poor contexts. Using a novel adversarial exercise with a national sample, our paired conjoint experiment across visibly-changing aviation environments finds the majority of tested security infrastructure visibly deterred simulated adversaries. Canine officer presence deterred, biometric scanners induced, and queue density had no appreciable effect upon target selection. Our findings offer useful criminological insights, clear policy applications, and novel quantitative methods for assessing visible deterrent processes in limited data environments.

AB  - Objectives We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases-100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim's gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

AB  - In daylight, burglars minimized the risks of being spotted by selecting "up-market" targets with better front cover and low occupancy that reflected the occupants' higher employment levels. After dark, townhouses with less cover were popular despite victims, fewer of whom were employed, raising more alerts. Evidence indicates consistency with routine activity theory, and target strategies appear rational, though shaped by differences in risks and offenders. Lifestyles and routine activities of victims, coupled with daylight and darkness changes, created burglary opportunities. Distinctive daylight and darkness strategies proved attractive to certain types of offenders, so that housing morphology, victims, their lifestyle, risks, rewards and burglar characteristics were distinctively aligned, providing the framework for target and area selection. Theories need to incorporate contrasts in daylight-darkness and housing morphologies, and relate to offender diversity.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterning of arson incidents in a large urban county.
   Methods: Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space-time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy.
   Results: Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons.
   Conclusions: Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this invisible Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment. Results may aid in inductive theory building as well as efforts to investigate and prevent arson.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed.

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that taste preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.

AB  - Offenders' crime location choices have been a central theme of criminological research. However, little is known about the difference by offenders' age in their crime location choices. Based on the perspective of offender spatial decision-making, this study explores the variation in crime location choices committed by street robbers in different age groups, and examines how age-related activity nodes, journey to crime, and social disorganization influence street robbers' location choices in a large Chinese city. This study examines 7860 street robberies committed by 4358 street robbers between 2012 and 2016 in ZG city, China. A conditional logit selection model was estimated to assess street robbers' crime location choice preferences. The results demonstrate that street robbers favor areas frequented by their age group, close to their residence, and low in social cohesion. Cybercafe acute accent s affect juvenile and young adult robbers' crime location choices, while transportation hubs impact those of young adult robbers and adult robbers. Schools affect all three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. Besides, the distance of journey to crime plays a significantly negative role in an offender's target choice, with the greatest impact in the youngest age group. These findings add insight to the clarification of the difference by age in offenders' crime location choices.

AB  - This research attempts to elaborate a routine activity model of violent victimization by incorporating an explicit rational choice perspective on potential targets' decision making to avoid violent encounters. We propose that the costs associated with a violent attack and the probability of offender retaliation depend on whether the offender's targeting strategy is opportunistic or deliberate-a function of the relational distance between the offender and target. Specifically, we propose that victim efforts to limit exposure to an offender may motivate a violent retaliatory response when the victim and offender are intimates compared to when they are strangers. We develop hypotheses based on these ideas and test them using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (1992-2000). The results suggest that female targets are more sensitive to an offender's targeting strategy than are males. We conclude with a discussion of how knowledge of the potential risk of violent retaliation on the part of intimate and spousal offenders can be used to create more efficacious policies to protect victims of violence.

AB  - Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.

AB  - This study examined the effects of shame proneness and two types of anticipated shame states-shame due to exposure and shame without exposure-in a rational choice model of offending intentions. Using scenario-based survey data from a sample of university students, it was found that (a) anticipated shame states without exposure reduced intentions to drive drunk and shoplift and (b) anticipated shame states due to exposure reduced shoplifting intentions. By contrast shame proneness had a positive effect on decisions to commit both drunk driving and shoplifting. The findings support the rational choice model of offending and indicate that the effects of shame are important components in individuals' decisions to offend.

AB  - This study investigates whether crime patterns fluctuate periodically throughout the year using data containing different property crime types in two Canadian cities with differing climates. Using police report data, a series of ordinary least squares (OLS; Vancouver, British Columbia) and negative binomial (Ottawa, Ontario) regressions were employed to examine the corresponding temporal patterns of property crime in Vancouver (2003-2013) and Ottawa (2006-2008). Moreover, both aggregate and disaggregate models were run to examine whether different weather and temporal variables had a distinctive impact on particular offences. Overall, results suggest that cities that experience greater variations in weather throughout the year have more distinct increases of property offences in the summer months and that different climate variables affect certain crime types, thus advocating for disaggregate analysis in the future.

AB  - Crime analysis uses past crime data to predict future crime locations and times. Typically this analysis relies on hot spot models that show clusters of criminal events based on past locations of these events. It does not consider the decision making processes of criminals as human initiated events susceptible to analysis using spatial choice models. This paper analyzes criminal incidents as spatial choice processes. Spatial choice analysis can be used to discover the distribution of people's behaviors in space and time. Two adjusted spatial choice models that include models of decision making processes are presented. The comparison results show that adjusted spatial choice models provide efficient and accurate predictions of future crime patterns and can be used as the basis for a law enforcement decision support system. This paper also extends spatial choice modeling to include the class of problems where the decision makers' preferences are derived indirectly through incident reports rather than directly through survey instruments.

AB  - Much individual-level resenl ch in criminology is based on deterministic models of street-crime and suite-crime. Factors that constrain individuals to crime or conformity are predominant. This paper explores the advantages of a more soft determinism in explaining crime; especially intimate violence. Routine activities theory, which assumes freedom of action and rational choice, is used here to analyze patterns of intimate violence, especially, child sexual abuse. Marcus Felson's model of predatory crime provides a unique interpretation of intimate violence. Criminal incidents involve the physical convergence of three elements: a motivated offender; a suitable target; and the absence of a capable guardian. The convergence of these factors in intimate violence is analyzed; the potential of routine activity theory in explaining domestic abuse is assessed. Finally suggestions for crime control in intimate violence based on routine activities theory are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted people's daily routine activities. Rooted in crime pattern and routine activity theories, this study tests whether the enactment of a Safer-at-Home mandate was associated with changes in the distance between individuals' home addresses and the locations of where they committed crimes (i.e., residence-to-crime distance). Analyses are based on violent (N = 282), property (N = 1552), and disorder crimes (N = 1092) reported to one police department located in a United States' Midwest suburb. Multilevel models show that residence-to-crime distances were significantly shorter during the Safer-at-Home order, compared to the pre- and post-Safer-at-Home timeframes, while controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics. Additionally, these relationships varied by crime type. Consistent with the literature, the findings support the argument that individuals tend to offend relatively near their home address. The current findings extend the state of the literature by highlighting how disruptions to daily routine activities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic led to alterations in crime patterns, in which analyses indicated shorter distances between home address and offense locations.

AB  - This article examines criminal behavior from a rational choice perspective, the set of behavioral principles underlying our legal institution. The authors use a subjective utility approach and specify experiential learning models of the formation of risk perceptions and rational choice models of theft and violence. They estimate the models using panel data on high risk youth from the Denver Youth Survey. Using random effects Tobit models of perceived risk and negative binomial models of counts of criminal acts, the authors find support for a rational choice model. Perceived risk follows a Bayesian updating model in which current risk perceptions are a function of prior risk perceptions phis new information based on experience with crime and arrest and observations of peers. Theft and violence are a function of the perceived risk of arrest, subjective psychic rewards (including excitement and social status), and perceived opportunities.

AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers' incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods.

AB  - Youth misuse of fire is a substantive community concern. Despite evidence which indicates youths account for a significant proportion of all deliberately lit fires within Australia, an absence of up-to-date, contextually specific research means the exact scope and magnitude of youth misuse of fire within Australia remains unknown. Despite research suggesting commonalities exist between youth misuse of fire and juvenile offending more broadly, misuse of fire is rarely explained using criminological theory. In light of this gap, a descriptive analysis of youth misuse of fire within New South Wales was performed. Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory were tested to explain differences in misuse of fire across age groups. Results suggest these environmental theories offer useful frameworks for explaining youth misuse of fire in New South Wales. It is argued that the Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory can be employed to better inform youth misuse of fire policy and prevention efforts.

AB  - Extant research on the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying pays little attention to the role of perpetrator traits in influencing workplace cyberbullying, as well as the unique occurrence context that distinguishes workplace cyberbullying with juvenile cyberbullying, workplace bullying, and adult cyberbullying in general. To fill these gaps, we consider the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying under the theoretical lens of the general theory of crime and routine activities theory. We build a model incorporating low self-control, a widely discussed perpetrator trait in criminology theories, with three types of routine activities representing the unique occurrence context for workplace cyberbullying-mWork, boundary-spanning in enterprise social media, and proactive email checking. We tested our model with 2025 employees in the United States. Our findings demonstrate that low self-control and the three routine activities are strong motivators for workplace cyberbullying. Our findings further show that the effect of low self-control on workplace cyberbullying is amplified by the three routine activities. The study contributes to our understanding of why workplace cyberbullying occurs and offers potential implications for managers interested in reducing incidences of workplace cyberbullying in their organization.

TI  - A Criminological Perspective on Power Grid Cyber attacks: Using Routine Activities Theory to Rational Choice Perspective to Explore Adversarial Decision-Making
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
KW  - adversarial decision-making
KW  - power grid cyber attacks
KW  - rational choice perspective
KW  - routine activities theory
AB  - The US power grid has been identified by security experts as a prime target for terrorist-based and state-sponsored cyber attacks. In addition to downing the grid, cyber attacks can also destroy and manipulate data systems, obtain sensitive intellectual property and steal trade secrets. Existing research has addressed the technical factors, such as vulnerabilities and poor intrusion detection systems, which lead to cyber attacks. However, it remains silent on the human factors in the cyber attack equation. This study uses a criminological framework, specifically Routine Activities Theory and Rational Choice Perspective to capture intelligent adversaries who plan and execute attacks based on their analysis of target suitability and guardianship efficacy. It uses a two-step methodology to identify adversary-, target-, and guardianship-specific factors that collectively impact decision-making processes. First, a document analysis of existing literature reveals nine factors (PARE RISKS) that influence adversarial decision-making: Prevention measures, Attacks and Alliances, Results, Ease of Access, Response and Recovery, Interconnectedness and Interdependencies, Security Testing, Assessments and Audits, Knowledge, Skills, Research and Development, and System Weaknesses. Second, surveys and interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 with various hackers, penetration testers, and power grid representatives helps validate and refine the PARE RISKS framework. This study identifies (i) adversary-specific factors as resources (skills, money, and time), and research (targets and techniques); (ii) target-specific factors as accessibility (electronic and physical) and weaknesses (outdated architecture and inadequate testing//updates); and (iii) guardian-specific factors as prevention (quality of prevention and intrusion detection measures). It argues that altering each of these three elements of Routine Activities Theory can impact adversarial decision-making, which may help reduce the likelihood of power grid cyber attacks.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevailcrime pattern and social disorganization theoryand consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

AB  - A challenge for studies assessing routine activities theory is accounting for the spatial and temporal confluence of offenders and targets given that people move about during the daytime and nighttime. We propose exploiting social media (Twitter) data to construct estimates of the population at various locations at different times of day, and assess whether these estimates help predict the amount of crime during two-hour time periods over the course of the day. We address these questions using crime data for 97,428 blocks in the Southern California region, along with geocoded information on tweets in the region over an eight month period. The results show that this measure of the temporal ambient population helps explain the level of crime in blocks during particular time periods. The use of social media data appear promising for testing various implications of routine activities and crime pattern theories, given their explicit spatial and temporal nature.

AB  - Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

AB  - Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization.
   Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness).
   Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime.
   Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

AB  - Attempts at classifying sexual offenses and the persons who commit them are reviewed relative to different ways that classifications can have value. Classifying offenses continues to be a productive exercise. The diversity of novel types of offending is being mapped and the identification of psychologically meaningful behavioral themes within broad categories of offense is promising as is the application of Routine Activities theory to target selection scripts. Classifying those who commit sexual offenses, despite considerable research effort being expended in the endeavor, has turned out to be less productive with typological models being largely superseded by dimensional systems. However, the development of standardized risk classes has value for improving communication in the sub-field of actuarial risk assessment and the development of theory-based prototypes has potential for theory development.

AB  - Prior information security studies have largely focused on understanding employee security behavior from a policy compliance perspective. We contend that there is a pressing need to develop a comprehensive understanding of the circumstances that lead to employee commitment of deliberate and malicious acts against organizational digital assets. Drawing on routine activity theory (RAT), we seek to establish a comprehensive model of employee-committed malicious computer abuse (MCA) by investigating the motivations of the offenders, the suitability of the desired targets, and the effect of security guardianship in organizational settings. Specifically, we delineate the effects of the individual characteristics of self-control, hacking self-efficacy, and moral beliefs, as well as the organizational aspects of deterrence based on the routine activity framework of crime. We tested this research model using research participants holding a wide range of corporate positions and possessing varying degrees of computer skills. Our findings offer fresh insights on insider security threats, identify new directions for future research, and provide managers with prescriptive guidance for formulating effective security policies and management programs for preventing MCA in organizations.

AB  - Prior research has identified a link between schools (particularly high schools) and neighborhood crime rates. However, it remains unclear whether the relationship between schools and crime is a reflection of other criminogenic dynamics at the neighborhood level or whether schools influence neighborhood crime patterns independently of other established structural predictors. We address this question by investigating the relationship between schools and serious crime at the block group level while controlling for the potentially criminogenic effects of neighborhood instability and structural disadvantage. We find that, net of other structural correlates, neighborhoods with high schools and middle schools experience more violent, property, and narcotics crimes than those without middle or high schools. Conversely, neighborhoods with elementary schools exhibit less property crime than those not containing elementary schools. These results, which are consistent with prior research and with explanations derived from the routine activities and social disorganization perspectives, suggest some strategies for police deployment and community involvement to control crime.

AB  - Historically speaking, criminological theory tends to pay great attention to identifying the various sources of criminal motivation while downplaying the opportunity to carry out crime in particular situations. However, perspectives that address situational opportunity have gained tremendous traction in the field over the past several decades to the point that there is now a substantial body of theory and research on the issue. This article reviews such theory and research within the context of four overlapping yet distinct lines of inquiry. First, we review scholarship that uses situational opportunity to understand individual victimization. Second, we discuss theory and research that link situational opportunity and high-crime places. Third, we explore scholarship that embraces a multicontextual opportunity perspective to understand crime and victimization events within neighborhood contexts. Fourth, we examine work that integrates situational opportunity into explanations of offending.

TI  - Spatial patterns of serial murder: An analysis of disposal site location choice
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW
AB  - Although the murders committed by serial killers may not be considered rational, there is growing evidence that the locations in which they commit their crimes maybe guided by an implicit, if limited rationality.
   The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time.
   Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities.

AB  - Cybercrime against critical infrastructure such as nuclear reactors, power plants, and dams has been increasing in frequency and severity. Recent literature regarding these types of attacks has been extensive but due to the sensitive nature of this field, there is very little empirical data. We address these issues by integrating Routine Activity Theory and Rational Choice Theory, and we create a classification tool called TRACI (Taxonomy for Risk Assessment of Cyberattacks on Critical Infrastructure). We take a Design Science Research approach to develop, evaluate, and refine the proposed artifact. We use mix methods to demonstrate that our taxonomy can successfully capture the characteristics of various cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. TRACI consists of three dimensions, and each dimension contains its own subdimensions. The first dimension comprises of hacker motivation, which can be financial, socio-cultural, thrill-seeking, and/or economic. The second dimension represents the assets such as cyber, physical, and/or cyber-physical components. The third dimension is related to threats, vulnerabilities, and controls that are fundamental to establishing and maintaining an information security posture and overall cyber resilience. Our work is among the first to utilize criminological theories and Design Science to create an empirically validated artifact for improving critical infrastructure risk management.

AB  - Temporal and spatial patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil, are analyzed considering the relevance of routine activity theory in a Latin American context. We use geo-referenced criminal event data, 2010-2013, analyzing spatial patterns using census tracts and temporal patterns considering seasons, months, days, and hours. Our analyses include difference in means tests, count-based regression models, and Kulldorff's scan test. We find that crime in Campinas, Brazil, exhibits both temporal and spatial-temporal patterns. However, the presence of these patterns at the different temporal scales varies by crime type. Specifically, not all crime types have statistically significant temporal patterns at all scales of analysis. As such, routine activity theory works well to explain temporal and spatial-temporal patterns of crime in Campinas, Brazil. However, local knowledge of Brazilian culture is necessary for understanding a portion of these crime patterns.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available.".

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

TI  - A crime without deviance: workplace theft as a routine activity
T2  - REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
KW  - EMPLOYEE THEFT
KW  - PUNISHMENT
KW  - BEHAVIORS
AB  - Workplace theft accounts for a considerable mass of crime. Economics and management literature addresses the phenomenon exclusively in terms of how to reduce it, while in sociology literature workplace theft is seen as an act of resistance against workplace injustice. In this article the phenomenon is studied using a "routine activity approach" (a "rational choice" approach used in American criminology) on the basis of a survey of actors in the mass marketing and cleaning sectors. Analyzing workplace theft as routine delinquency leads to seeing it less as deviance from a norm than a function of opportunities and surveillance. Principal-agent and agency costs theory is used to understand how it is that anti-theft surveillance involves not prevention/repression logic but rather tolerance/acceptance of what cannot be overseen. As an example of routine delinquency, workplace theft is less likely to scandalize than it is to be instrumentalized by its victims : employers can use theft as grounds for firing the employee. Lastly, the theoretical issues raised by the routine activity approach are critically discussed.

AB  - This article aims to review empirical research on residential burglary over the last three to four decades and relate these findings to a model of 'dysfunctional expertise' (Nee & Ward, this issue) that is rooted in mainstream cognitive psychology. It begins with a description of the elements of expertise that might fit in to this model and then traces the offender's decision-chain, using the model as an explanatory tool. Studies have shed light on: the automatic and habitual appraisal of the criminogenic environment during the daily, routine activities of the burglar and his journey to crime; accruing situational awareness and automatic recognition of cues signifying vulnerable properties during target selection; and speedy deployment of offending scripts based on tried and tested methods when entering and carrying out the crime. The review highlights how little is known about decisions, reflections and emotions after the crime. Aspects of the model that require development through further research, as well as the value of using the model for crime prevention purposes, are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Extant research has provided support for the micro-level predictions of rational choice models of crime. Yet, a central feature of the rational choice perspective in the broader social sciences-that it is multilevel in focus, situating individuals within broader community social structures-has been neglected within criminology. In this article, we discuss and test a model that links community structural characteristics to several individual expectations and preferences relevant to crime. Using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, we find that objective levels of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage influence individuals' perceptions of, and preferences for, the risks, costs, and rewards associated with offending indirectly by affecting perceived disorder and perceived opportunities for legitimate avenues of success within one's neighborhood. The implications of a multilevel rational choice model of offending are discussed.

AB  - This article employs Routine Activities and Crime Pattern theories to explore the factors that lead to increased risk of bike theft, focusing on Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority Metrorail (Metro) property. Utilizing the Metro bike census and other data, we use negative binomial regression analysis to model the relationship between bike thefts and various station-and neighborhood-level risk factors that can either create or close off opportunities for bike thefts. The findings indicate that bike thefts around Metro stations are positively influenced by the number of targets, as measured by the number of bikes per station, and the presence of likely offenders, as measured by the volume of auto-related larcenies. Stations that have greater guardianship, as measured by the number of nearby businesses, are less likely to experience bike theft. The implications of these findings for theory, methodological considerations, and crime prevention are discussed. We suggest that bike racks can be placed in locations with greater informal guardianship, and discuss ways our findings can inform traditional interventions such as bike locking campaigns.

AB  - The combining of administrative, civil, and criminal law has broadened modern crime control mechanisms and greatly increased the legal authority and discretion of law enforcement officers. Such legal hybridity has contributed specifically to the pervasiveness of spatial regulatory practices (or spatial remedies), such as the use of banishment policies and civil gang injunctions (CGIs), by police in urban centers. While banishment policies and CGIs exemplify the reliance on legal hybridity to manage "deviant" populations spatially, empirical evidence suggests that spatial remedies guided by the theoretical underpinnings of deterrence and broken windows perspectives are not efficacious at predicting observed behavioral changes. We argue for a critical approach to understanding disobedience to spatial remedies, suggesting that routine activities theory is an appropriate framework to expose why these mechanisms fail to generate robust compliance or remedy problem areas.

KW  - ARREST
AB  - Following the lead of Grasmick and Bursik (1990), we propose that significant others and conscience both function as agents of social control to deter illicit behavior in a manner similar to that provided by the law and more formal, bureaucratic organizations. All three-conscience, significant others, and formal organizations-entail potential threats and costs (i.e., shame, embarrassment, and formal sanctions). Actors consider these potential threats and costs, and assess the certainty and severity of them, in deciding whether or not to engage in criminal or deviant behavior. In the research reported here, data from a sample of undergraduate students are employed to examine the effects of perceived certainty and severity of shame, embarrassment, and formal sanction threats of the self-reported prevalence of involvement in a variety of forms of academic dishonesty. The results suggest rather limited support for the deterrence/rational choice model, nearly all of which is due to the influence of conscience (shame).

AB  - It is well established that offenders' routine activity locations (nodes) shape their crime locations, but research examining the geography of offenders' routine activity spaces has to date largely been limited to a few core nodes such as homes and prior offense locations, and to small study areas. This paper explores the utility of police data to provide novel insights into the spatial extent of, and overlap between, individual offenders' activity spaces. It includes a wider set of activity nodes (including relatives' homes, schools, and non-crime incidents) and broadens the geographical scale to a national level, by comparison to previous studies. Using a police dataset including n = 60,229 burglary, robbery, and extra-familial sex offenders in New Zealand, a wide range of activity nodes were present for most burglary and robbery offenders, but fewer for sex offenders, reflecting sparser histories of police contact. In a novel test of the criminal profiling assumptions of homology and differentiation in a spatial context, we find that those who offend in nearby locations tend to share more activity space than those who offend further apart. However, in finding many offenders' activity spaces span wide geographic distances, we highlight challenges for crime location choice research and geographic profiling practice.

AB  - Criminological research on fear of crime primarily has been based on, and supportive of, an opportunity framework. The current research tests an expanded risk-assessment model of fear, which is rooted in an opportunity framework, by incorporating a measure of delinquent lifestyle, which is a known risk factor for victimization, using a sample of youth aged 10-16 years. The findings from longitudinal structural equation models do not support the applicability of a risk-assessment model of fear in adolescence. Namely, although increased involvement in a delinquent lifestyle is associated strongly with an increase in victimization over time, no such association exists with the perceived risk of victimization. Most importantly, as adolescents become more involved in a delinquent lifestyle and are victimized at a higher rate than nondelinquent youth, their fear of victimization actually decreases at a significantly higher rate than more prosocial youth.

AB  - The ambient population has been regarded as an important indicator for analyzing or predicting thefts. However, the literature has taken it as a homogenous group and seldom explored the varied impacts of different kinds of ambient populations on thefts. To fill this gap, supported by mobile phone trajectory data, this research investigated the relationship between ambient populations of different social groups and theft in a major city in China. With the control variables of motivated offenders and guardianship, spatial-lag negative binominal models were built to explore the effects of the ambient populations of different social groups on the distribution of theft. The results found that the influences of ambient populations of different social groups on the spatial distribution of theft are different. Accounting for the difference in the "risk-benefit" characteristics among different activity groups to the offenders, individuals from the migrant population are the most likely to be potential victims, followed by suburban and middle-income groups, while college, affluent, and affordable housing populations are the least likely. The local elderly population had no significant impact. This research has further enriched the studies of time geography and deepened routine activity theory. It suggests that the focus of crime prevention and control strategies developed by police departments should shift from the residential space to the activity space.

AB  - Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted. Using data in 3337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before. This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent. Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has impacted the world in ways not seen in generations. Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped to study crime in society as never before. We encourage researchers to study specific types of crime, in a temporal fashion (following the stay-at-home orders), and placed-based. The results will reveal not only why, where, when, and to what extent crime changed, but also how to influence future crime reduction.

AB  - This study aims to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of sexual crimes in Haining city and the spatial relationship between them and urban commercial service facilities, so as to provide decision-making reference for the prevention and treatment of sexual crimes. Based on the data of 311 sexual crimes in the case management system of public security organs and the POI data of urban functional facilities in the community policing system, using methods such as nearest neighbor index, nuclear density estimation and Geodetector, the data from January 2014 to September 2021 are analyzed. The formation of the spatial pattern of sexual crimes is the result of the multiple factors, especially the distribution of KTVs, Internet cafes, hotels and other commercial service facilities. Sexual crimes will increase significantly in areas with mixed facilities. We put forward countermeasures and suggestions for the effective development of sexual crime rectification work in Haining.

AB  - The empirical observation that a small number of micro places generate the bulk of urban crime problems has become a criminological axiom. Explanations for the persistence of high-crime places have traditionally drawn upon opportunity theories of crime. In a new book, Weisburd, Groff, and Yang suggest that social disorganization could also be a powerful explanation for the uneven distribution of crime within neighborhoods. In this article, we explain briefly why their empirical work considerably sharpens knowledge about crime concentrations in the city. We then offer a critique of their conclusions concerning the relative contributions of social and situational variables in explaining crime hot spots and the preventive implications they draw from these findings. Finally, we suggest new research that could invigorate the debate on the formation and persistence of high-crime places and could support interventions that seek to change the situational precipitators and facilitators of crime.

AB  - Several researchers have linked the configuration of public places to the risk of sexual attack against women, including rape. Based on the routine activity approach and crime pattern theory, we expect to find the greatest risk of outdoor urban rape near public places that are "target rich," "offender rich," and "guardian poor." We apply the theory to 193 outdoor rape locations in Campinas, Brazil, 2010-2013. We measure distances to the nearest bus stops, bars, and residences, then compare each of these to the distance from random points in the same city. Consistent with theory, outdoor rape victimizations occur disproportionately near bus stops and bars, but at least 250 meters away from the location of the nearest residence of any type. This baseline model suggests that urban planners could make women more secure from outdoor sexual attack by improving the design and location of public places, reducing the concealment of such places, and enhancing guardianship.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic "edges," as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study's findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an "edge" under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.

AB  - The article builds on previous work by Roman and colleagues in order to specify the potential causes for increased incidents of violent assault in areas featuring a high number of prosocial institutions (i.e., schools, recreation centers). Utilizing aspects of routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, the argument is presented that both poverty and youth population will have a conditioning impact on the relationship between the presence of prosocial places and incidence of violent assault. Least squares regression was utilized in order to show that such institutions can serve as generators for offending and/or victimization, and that their location in lower income areas may magnify the problem.

AB  - This paper adapts three conceptual frameworks from Environmental Criminology Routine Activity Theory, Rational Choice Theory, and Situational Crime Prevention to create a Crime Prevention Toolkit that helps librarians analyze and manage criminal activity in contemporary academic libraries. The toolkit is applied to a case study of patron-laptop theft at an urban academic library to demonstrate its use in analyzing criminal activity and creating a crime-problem intervention. The intervention was rapidly successful at eliminating patron-property theft. There were no patron-laptop thefts of any kind in the library after implementation of the intervention, in contrast to 12 recorded laptop thefts the previous academic year. This is the first time a research based, conceptual framework of three theories from Environmental Criminology has been used to analyze and manage criminal activity in an academic library. It is also the first time a patron-property theft intervention in an academic library has been demonstrated effective in an empirical inquiry.

AB  - This article examines whether potentially criminogenic places (including bars, liquor stores, restaurants, public transport hubs, drug markets, and more), located within a 1,240-feet radius of parolees' residences (the home node), predict their rearrest or revocation. Taking these features into account, in addition to individual traits and behaviors, might pave the way for more accurate risk assessment that could help make supervision sensitive to place-based risks. However, multivariate survival analysis of 1,632 parolees released to Newark during July 2007 to June 2009 found little evidence that these factors increased the risk of failure. Successful operationalization of environmental risk will probably need to incorporate more detailed measures of parolees' routine activities, including the settings and paths they frequent beyond their home environment.

AB  - Background: For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geo-graphical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns.
   Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013.
   Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern.
   Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces.
   Conclusions: Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior.

AB  - This article investigates the effects of target characteristics on non-residential burglary sighting risks, and evaluates a sighting model framed by criminal event theories. It is based on a random sample of individual UK burglary incidents for which data were collected from officer questionnaires, victim interviews, site surveys and police records. The study measures guardianship 'actively' during burglary incidence and extends it beyond occupancy to include neighbours, passers-by and security patrols. The key influence on sighting is guardianship, conditioned by degrees of exposure, partly contingent on means of access to the site and premises. Neighbour guardianship is of over-riding importance in shaping sighting risks, particularly after dark, when guardianship from passers-by may also play a role. Guardianship from the occupancy of premises played no significant part in the sighting of burglars. At least half the explanation of sighting risks appears to lie in differences in target characteristics. Distinctive neighbour guardianship measures are identified.

AB  - Situational crime prevention (SCP) is one of criminology's more misunderstood theoretical perspectives, despite it being widely implemented in the practice of criminal justice. Since its introduction some critics have alleged that SCP is theoretically weak, oppositional to traditional criminology (TC), ideologically conservative and a tool of the powerful. The repercussions of these beliefs can be seen across different dimensions of academia, from basic criminological pedagogy to theory critique and development. We argue that these allegations are misperceptions stemming from core misunderstandings of SCP, and the related rational choice perspective (RCP). Rather than being fundamentally different from TC, SCP, and the RCP are well-positioned for rich theoretical integration with an array of traditional theories, including learning, control, strain, and other theories.

AB  - This study examines the deterrent effects of neighbourhood watch signs and police signs as measures of symbolic guardianship on burglars versus non-offenders. In a virtual reality experiment, 181 burglars and 172 non-offenders scouted a virtual neighbourhood and were exposed to neighbourhood watch signs and/or signs suggesting police surveillance in the area. With neighbourhood watch signs present, both burglars and non-offenders perceived the neighbourhood residents as more likely to intervene. Burglars were also more likely to select a target closer to the exit than non-offenders when neighbourhood watch signs were present. The presence of police signs reduced the time spent scouting and the distance travelled for both burglars and non-offenders. Furthermore, as compared to non-offenders burglars selected houses with easier access, travelled less distance, and reported higher anticipation of neighbourhood resident intervention. Symbolic guardianship through neighbourhood watch or police sign seems to elicit only small effects in deterring burglars. They should not immediately be discounted as preventive measures, however, as small-effect interventions may be valuable as additions to well-established interventions.

AB  - Crime within Arabic countries is significantly different from Western crime in type, frequency, and motivation. For example, motor vehicle theft (MVT) has constituted the largest proportion of property crime incidents in Saudi Arabia (SA) for decades. This is in stark contrast to Western countries where burglary and street theft dominate. Environmental criminology theories, such as routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, have the potential to help to investigate Arabic crime. However, there is no research that has sought to evaluate the validity of these theories within such a different cultural context. This article represents a first step in addressing this substantial research gap, taking MVT within SA as a case study. We evaluate previous MVT studies using an environmental criminology approach with a critical view to applying environmental criminology to an Arabic context. The article identifies a range of key features in SA that are different from typical Western contexts. These differences could limit the appropriateness of existing methodologies used to apply environmental criminology. The study also reveals that the methodologies associated with traditional environmental crime theory need adjusting more generally when working with MVT, not least to account for shifts in the location of opportunities for crime with time.

AB  - As time goes by, hazard rate of the society would increase if crime prediction was not implemented. Based on objective factors of offenders and victims characteristics, AHP method can be established to get a quantitative and qualitative analysis on crime prediction. Crime prediction is a strategic and tactical measure for crime prevention. According to AHP analysis, two prediction models of the optimal predictive crime locations are put forward. Standard Deviational Ellipses Model and Key Feature adjusted Spatial Choice Model were formulated to account for the anticipated position with various elements from AHP method. These models could be applied in a computer simulation of situation tests of the series murders. Besides, applying those models in certain real case demonstrates how the models work. Through models comparison, the results are summarized that Key Feature adjusted Spatial Choice Model is more conducive in confirming the guilty place. In conclusion, the suggested models, including detailed criminal map, are easy to implement.

AB  - Academic studies on football-related crimes have predominantly focused on violent crimes and fans engaged in these crimes. Unlike these studies which may be deemed a reflection of the traditional criminology in the football context, this paper examines the crime patterns focused on where and when theft crimes might occur on match days and why such patterns might emerge. Routine activities theory and crime pattern theory which are two related theories of environmental criminology provide a theoretical framework for the study. These two theories successfully reveal how the components of the social and physical environment provide the necessary conditions for stadium-related theft. Methodologically, for the spatial analysis of theft crimes, the methods of Kernel Density Estimation and spatial permutation test are employed; for the temporal analysis, a "match adjusted temporal analysis" is developed. Using the hotspotting technique around the Elland Road Stadium of Leeds United football team, it is suggested that theft crimes are not randomly distributed in time (match days and non-match days) and space. The risk of theft (per unit of time) is found to be particularly elevated at certain locations near to the stadium on match days, and for a window of time before, during and after matches take place. Analysing the spatial and temporal dimensions of stadium-related theft crime is likely to provide guidance about when and where to deploy officers by informing intelligence services.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that tourists are particularly likely to be victimized, especially with regard to property crimes like theft from tourist accommodation (burglary). Guided by the criminal opportunity perspective, we examine the extent to which environmental and routine activities-related factors explain burglary using the data from a sample of Australian tourists (N = 1,027). Bayesian variable selection with a stochastic search algorithm was used to analyze the data. Our findings demonstrate the utility of opportunity theories in explaining crime against tourists. We found that the location and type of accommodation together with the use of target hardening and guardianship strategies are helpful for understanding burglary from tourist accommodation. Practical implications for crime prevention are also discussed.

AB  - We extend the use of rational choice models of criminal activity to examine the use of 'sting' operations. These operations are modeled as technological innovations in law enforcement that influence the probability of detection/conviction of criminal activities. We ask: do all sting operations have the same impact on the supply of criminal activity? We find that such impacts are sensitive to the type of sting used and the competitiveness of the criminal market in which the sting is used.

AB  - Objectives
   To apply crime-specific models based on differing potential offender pools and opportunity structures to temporary and permanent motor vehicle theft (MVT).
   Method
   Using 310 U. S. cities with 50,000 or more residents, the current study developed and examined crime-specific multivariate models for temporary and permanent MVT rates. To evaluate the distinctiveness of crime-specific variables' associations with each MVT type, the study also predicted each MVT rate via measures theoretically specific to the other.
   Results
   Among temporary-specific variables, young male population and the percentage of households without a vehicle were positively associated with temporary MVT. Permanent-specific measures of adult male property offender pool size, percentage of households with high disposable income, unemployment, U.S.-Mexico border proximity, and auto-related businesses were associated with permanent MVT (though in an unexpected direction for disposable income). Some variables were associated with both types of MVT, but young male population was uniquely associated with temporary MVT while unemployment rate, distance to U.S.-Mexico border and number of auto-related businesses were specific to permanent MVT.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that specific prevention approaches are needed for each type of MVT. Shortcomings of the research include potential misclassification of temporary and permanent MVT and lack of some potentially important opportunity variables.

AB  - This paper uses graph theoretical measures to analyse the relationship between street network usage, as well as other street- and area-level factors, and dissident Republican violence in Belfast. A multi-level statistical model is used. Specifically, we employ an observation-level random-effects (OLRE) Poisson regression and use variables at the street and area levels. Street- and area-level characteristics simultaneously influence where violent incidents occur. For every 10% change in the betweenness value of a street segment, the segment is expected to experience 1.32 times as many incidents. Police stations (IRR: 22.05), protestant churches (IRR: 6.19) and commercial premises (IRR: 1.44) on each street segment were also all found to significantly increase the expected number of attacks. At the small-area level, for every 10% change in the number of Catholic residents, the number of incidents is expected to be 4.45 times as many. The results indicate that along with other factors, the street network plays a role in shaping terrorist target selection. Streets that are more connected and more likely to be traversed will experience more incidents than those that are not. This has important practical implications for the policing of political violence in Northern Ireland generally and for shaping specific targeted interventions.

AB  - Objectives: The utility of configural behavior settings is explored as an alternative unit of analysis for place-based criminological research. Four research questions are addressed: (1) How do robberies cluster within certain behavior settings? (2) How are conclusions about robbery's behavior settings influenced by the distance interval used to measure the proximate environment? (3) Are dominant behavior settings homogeneous across patrol districts? and (4) Is there temporal variability among dominant behavior settings?
   Method: Conjunctive analysis of case configurations is used to construct configural behavior settings around 453 robbery locations in Henderson, Nevada, between 2007 and 2009.
   Results: The major findings of this study are that (1) the majority of personal robberies occur within a small number of dominant configural behavior settings and (2) the composition of behavior settings and the proportion of incidents for which they account varies by the distance interval used to measure the proximate environment, patrol district, and time of day.
   Conclusions: Configural behavior settings provide an alternative unit of analysis that can be used in future place-based research to improve our understanding of criminogenic microenvironments. Replication of this study in other cities that vary in urban design would further demonstrate the merits of this approach.

AB  - Purpose: According to the rational choice approach, offenders consider costs and benefits when making decisions. This study applies this framework to sexual offenses and examines how various decisions made by perpetrators of sexual crimes influenced the desired and undesired crime outcomes that resulted.
   Methods: The study examines 2296 crimes of a sexual nature committed by a sample of 898 offenders evaluated at the Massachusetts Treatment Center. Using Generalized Estimating Equations, 23 predictor variables measuring sexually coercive decisions made in each crime about four aspects (who?, when?, where?, and how?) are used to predict ten desired (positive) and seven undesired (negative) crime outcomes for offenders.
   Results: Results indicated that decisions made by offenders in the context of their sexual crimes were mostly oriented towards the production of immediate positive outcomes and the prevention of immediate negative outcomes, but demonstrated little consideration for non-immediate negative outcomes.
   Conclusions: Sexual offenders engage in myopic or hyperbolic discounting when making criminal decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to advance the idea that low self-control-one of the strongest known predictors of crime-likely has effects that are conditional on the supply of criminal opportunities. Some scholars initially interpreted the theory to make this exact prediction, but Gottfredson and Hirschi (2003) have rejected this interpretation. They have insisted that the simplistic nature of most crimes ensures that opportunities are limitless and that variation in opportunity simply reflects variation in self-control. We trace the history of this uncertain position of opportunity in self-control theory and argue that it should play a significant role in the theory, even if Gottfredson and Hirschi did not originally envision this. Next, we draw on routine activities theory and applications of it to individual offending to offer a theoretical statement of how opportunity should be incorporated into self-control theory. Last, using data from a national sample of juveniles, we test the arguments that have been made. The analysis suggests that the effects of low self-control on delinquency partially depend on the availability of criminal opportunities, as indicated by the time juveniles spend with their friends or away from the supervision of their parents.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between land use, walkability, and the outcomes of neighborhood crime rates of larceny and aggravated assault. We use a combination of OLS regression models, harmonic analysis of diurnal patterns, and geospatial statistical techniques to examine the spatial patterning of larceny and aggravated assault in 782 Census blocks in Miami-Dade County, Florida with long-term data from 2007 to 2015. The results show that neighborhoods (i.e., Census block clusters) with higher levels of walkability have greater levels of aggravated assault. We also find that the increasing land-use diversity increases both aggravated assault and larceny. Finally, aggravated assault peaks during late night hours, while larceny peaks during daytime hours. Based on the results of our study using conventional and geospatial analyses, routine activity and social disorganization theories of neighborhood crime are partially supported, in that more motivated offenders and potential targets increase crime rates, while increased guardianship and informal social control reduce crime rates. The results of this study have important implications for security experts, law-enforcement agencies, and urban planning policy specialists focused on reducing crime in metropolitan areas. It is also relevant for theoretical frameworks designed to explain and predict temporal and spatial crime patterning.

We identify three characteristics of ordinary businesses: services locations (on-site or off-site), volume of transactions (higher to lower) and clientele (neighbourhood or beyond). Businesses providing services or products on-site, used frequently and serving neighbourhood residents displayed strong associations with increased risks of victimization. Findings demonstrate the importance of recognizing how ordinary businesses influence crime patterns.

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour.

AB  - Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes. Building on crime pattern theory and combining information from police records and other sources, this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in. In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago. The theoretical implications of these findings and their use for investigative purposes are discussed, and suggestions for future inquiry are made.

AB  - Studies are showing evidence of the effect of changes in routine activities due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on crime levels in many cities worldwide. This study evaluates the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporal and spatial patterns of crime in three major cities under very different national contexts. Each of the three countries and cities experienced different levels of pandemic restrictions and societal closure. The cities of New York (the United States), Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Stockholm (Sweden) were selected as cases. Temporal quantitative methods, spatial statistics techniques, and Geographical Information System (GIS) underlie the methodology used in this study. Findings show that there is a statistically significant break in the trend in crime levels after the stay-at-home orders were implemented in New York City, Sao Paulo, and Stockholm in the first months of 2020; the only exception was for murder. Such an impact varies by crime type and city context, but increases again after a few months, indicating how fast crime and criminals adapt. Residential burglary decreased, whereas nonresidential burglary increased overall. Changes in the levels and geography of vehicle thefts were observed, with an overall increase of significant cold spots but, in several cases, also solidification of existing crime concentrations in known crime attractors and in some deprived areas.

AB  - This study tested models of an individual's choice to copy illegally music using survey data from a random sample of adults who acquired recorded music. It added to the short list of studies of crime based on data from a general population sample and formally tested the added predictive power of an augmented crime model containing variables from both the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and rational choice models. The results supported the desirability of using general population samples and the augmented model. Policies that change attitudes and perceived norms have the potential to reduce crime.

AB  - This study investigates whether individual- and area-level factors explain variation in the residence-to-crime distances (RC distance) for 10 offense types.
   Five years of police data from Dallas, Texas, are analyzed using multilevel models (hierarchical-linear/multi-level modeling).
   Residence-to-crime distances for Dallas offenders varied notably across offense types. Although several area characteristics such as residential instability and concentrated immigration were associated with the overall variance in RC distance, neither these nor the individual-level characteristics used in our models explained the offense-type variance in the RC distance.
   Although individual- and neighborhood-level factors did not explain substantial variation in RC distance across the various offenses, neighborhood-level factors explained a significant portion of neighborhood-level variance. Other finding included a curvilinear effect of age on RC distance. The salience of these findings and their implications for future research and offender travel theory are discussed.

AB  - The frequently predicted relationship between social class and criminal behavior is theoretically vacillating and empirically exiguous. We present an extended rational choice model which integrates the effects of an individual's social status on his or her subjective evaluations of (1) costs, (2) utility, (3) the probability of apprehension, (4) the selective incentives, and (5) the ititernalization of social norms. We test the model against the offences of shoplifting and tax-evasion. The data source derived from the German General Social Survey empirically supports the theoretical model. There exists no prevalent relationship between an individual's social status and his or her incentives towards criminal comportment. However, the social status of an individual affects the type of offences committed. The subjectively expected probability of either failing or succeeding in a criminal act takes greater precedence over the fear of retribution or the expected utility. Additionally, internalized norms decrease the probability of committing a crime.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, environmental criminologists have explored the application of agent-based models (ABMs) of crime events and various theoretical frameworks applied to understand them. Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort.

AB  - In the economics and housing literature, the narrative of the arsonist for profit is popularized, where a would-be offender destroys personal property for financial gain. More of than not, arson is expected to increase during periods of economic decline. Over a 12-year period, data on this crime and other demographic variables were collected for 264 counties to study the impact of the 2007 recession on this firesetting. The analyses herein find no support for the profiting arsonist. Implications for future research in this area are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: Investigate the relationship between thoughtfully reflective decision-making (TRDM) and computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and computer-focused cybercrime victimization.
   Method: Survey data collected from samples of 1,039 employees and 418 students at a large private university were analyzed using ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression to test the effects of TRDM on computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and victimization.
   Results: TRDM reduces computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and computer-focused cybercrime victimization across measures and samples. The sensitivity analyses also indicated that TRDM is a more robust predictor of cyber deviance involvement than victimization. The results from moderation analyses showed that, whereas protective effects of TRDM are invariant across genders, they are less salient among older employees for the scenario-based measure of cybercrime victimization.
   Conclusions: Individual-level cognitive decision-making processes are important in predicting computer-focused cyber deviance involvement and victimization. These results can inform the development of targeted institutional and criminal justice policies aimed at reducing computer-focused cybercrime.

AB  - Although studies have been made of different subtypes of individuals who committed sexual homicides, the research into nonstranger and stranger sexual homicides remains limited. This study therefore aimed to examine whether those who sexually murder nonstrangers differ from those who kill strangers. Data derived from police records, court documents, and published case reports spanning a 31 year period (1988-2018) in mainland China were used to examine the modus operandi of 127 males who committed sexual homicides (45 nonstranger and 82 stranger cases). Relative to nonstranger sexual homicides, stranger sexual homicides were more likely to have been committed by individuals with a previous sexual offense conviction and the victims were more likely to have been single and employed at the time of the offense. Furthering the analysis, a logistic regression found that individuals who targeted strangers were significantly more likely to have committed their homicide at an outdoor location, to have been sexually motivated, and to have used murder weapons that required more physical strength than those who killed nonstranger victims. These findings can be informative to law enforcement agents and security professionals in their investigative processes.

AB  - Recent studies point to the potential theoretical and practical benefits of focusing police resources on crime hot spots. However, many scholars have noted that such approaches risk displacing crime or disorder to other places where programs are not in place. Although much attention has been paid to the idea of displacement, methodological problems associated with measuring it have often been overlooked. We try to fill these gaps in measurement and understanding of displacement- and the related phenomenon of diffusion of crime control benefits. Our main focus is on immediate spatial displacement or diffusion of crime to areas near the targeted sites of an intervention. Do focused crime prevention efforts at places simply result in a movement of offenders to areas nearby targeted sites - "do they simply move crime around the corner"? Or, conversely, will a crime prevention effort focusing on specific places lead to improvement in areas nearby-what has come to be termed a diffusion of crime control benefits? Our data are drawn from a controlled study of displacement and diffusion in Jersey City, New Jersey. Two sites with substantial street-level crime and disorder were targeted and carefully monitored during an experimental period. Two neighboring areas were selected as "catchment areas" from which to assess immediate spatial displacement or diffusion. Intensive police interventions were applied to each target site but not to the catchment areas. More than 6,000 20-minute social observations were conducted in the target and catchment areas. They were supplemented by interviews and ethnographic field observations. Our findings indicate that, at least for crime markets involving drugs and prostitution, crime does not simply move around the corner. Indeed, this study supports the position that the most likely outcome of such focused crime prevention efforts is a diffusion of crime control benefits to nearby areas.

AB  - Alfred Adler is often introduced and discussed incorrectly as one of Freud's students and as a psychoanalytic theorist in criminology and psychology textbooks. While thinkers such as Freud and Jung theorize about crime in tangential ways, as almost an afterthought to their accounts of neurosis and personality, Alfred Adler was one of the few pioneers in the history of psychology who had an actual theory of crime. Yet, Adler's writings on crime, its causes and assumptions have been largely overlooked in contemporary research. While Adler espoused the view that crime represents a "useless" response to the social demands of life, we argue that Adler's theory of crime presupposes a rational choice model of criminal behavior, thus mirroring the Classical School perspective on crime. This paper provides a synthesis and a critique of Alfred Adler's theory of crime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Criminologists have long-known that different locations have varying levels of risk for criminal victimization. Based on the geometry of crime and its corresponding crime generators and crime attractors, edges (boundaries between relatively homogeneous neighborhoods) are locations with an elevated risk of criminal victimization. In this article, we investigate the importance of edges. We find that criminal victimization rates are 2-3 times on an edge compared to elsewhere. However, this effect decreases very quickly moving away from these locations, with the effect gone at 40 meters. This general effect is identified in a number of contexts and locations.

AB  - Immigrants and natives are generally comparable in committing violent crimes in many Western cities. However, little is known about spatial differences between internal migrant offenders and native offenders in committing violence in contemporary urban China. To address this gap, this research aims to explore spatial variation in violent crimes committed by migrant and native offenders, and examine different effects of ambient population, crime attractors, crime generators, and offender anchor points on these crimes. Offender data, mobile phone data, and points-of-interest (POI) data are combined to explain the crime patterns of these offenders who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in a large Chinese city by using box maps and negative binomial regression models. It is demonstrated that migrant and native violent crimes vary enormously across space. Ambient population is only positively related to migrant violent crimes. Crime attractors and generators have more significant and stronger correlations with migrant violent crimes, while offender anchor points have a stronger association with native violent crimes. The results reveal that migrant offenders tend to be attracted by larger amounts of people and more affected by crime attractors and generators than native offenders.

AB  - Community and problem-oriented policing have shaped the debate over the role of the American police for three decades. In the 1990s, the federal government provided billions of dollars via the COPS program to promote police reform. During this time, community and problem-solving practices became more common. Research focusing specifically on whether COPS grants directly resulted in reductions in crime remains mixed. Two archetypes of community policing can be identified, each rooted in a different neighborhood theory of crime: broken windows theory and social disorganization theory. Problem-oriented policing draws on theories of criminal opportunity, such as routine activity and rational choice theory, to direct interventions aimed at altering environmental conditions to reduce crime and disorder. The weight of the empirical evidence is that community and problem-oriented policing can reduce crime and disorder. Many important questions require systematic investigation.

AB  - Decisions to commit crimes are often made under the influence of visceral feelings such as anger or sexual arousal. Rational choice models of offender decision-making assume that individuals carl anticipate, in an unaroused state, their responses to such visceral feelings. This assumption is tested in an experiment in which sexually aroused and nonaroused males predict their own behavior in a date rape scenario. Aroused and nonaroused participants were asked a battery of questions designed to measure their perceptions of the costs and benefits of acting in a sexually aggressive manner, their level of arousal, and a probabilistic prediction as to how aggressively they would act in the conditions described in the scenario, The authors find that sexual arousal does increase subjects' expectations of their own sexual aggressiveness and that this impact is not mediated by perceptions of the costs or benefits of such aggression.

AB  - Drawing upon rational choice, routine activity, and social disorganization theories, this study investigates changes in rates of property crime known (reported) to police in the United States from 1958 to 1995. Predictor variables include changes in rates of inflation; technological, cyclical, and frictional unemployment; arrest rates for property crimes disaggregated by race (ARPCDR); the interaction of ARPCDR and technological unemployment (to test effects of rising unemployment on whites versus blacks); and a measure of police provisioning. A Beach-MacKinnon Full Maximum-Likelihood FGLS AR1 Method (accompanied by residual analysis) is employed. Significant positive effects are established for (a) inflation, (b) cyclical unemployment, (c) frictional unemployment, and (d) the interaction of white arrest rates and technological unemployment. Police provisioning is not found to be significant. Policy implications are explored along with future policy considerations.

AB  - There is an ongoing American policy debate about the appropriate legal status for psychoactive drugs. Prohibition, decriminalization, and legalization positions are all premised on assumptions about the behavioral effects of drug laws. What is actually known and not known about these effects is reviewed. Rational-choice models of legal compliance suggest that criminalization reduces use through restricted drug availability, increased drug prices, and the deterrent effect of the risk of punishment. Research on these effects illustrates the need for a more realistic perspective that acknowledges the limitations of human rationality and the importance of moral reasoning and informal social control factors. There are at least 7 different mechanisms by which the law influences drug use, some of which are unintended and counterproductive. This framework is used to explore the potential behavioral effects of decriminalization and legalization.

AB  - Places with persistently high levels of crime, hot spots, are an important object of study. To some extent, the high levels of crime at such hot spots are likely to be related to flows of people. City center locations with large flows of people are quite often also hot spots, e.g., hot spots for pick pocketing at a central train station, or hot spots for assault in the nightlife district. This can be related to crime pattern theory, or to the routine activity perspective, which both suggest that flows of people can affect crime. The present study attempts to explore and quantify whether there are differences in the association between flows of people and crime for different crime types. The analysis considers locations with high crime counts for six crime types in the city of Malmo, Sweden. For each crime type, hot spots are identified and mapped, and in order to explore whether, or how, these are related to flows of people, the crime levels are then analyzed in relation to the number of people who boarded a local bus (N = 33,134,198) nearby. The paper shows that all six crime types are associated with flows of people, although less so for arson and vandalism. This is hypothesized to be due to the relatively constant target availability for these crimes as opposed to the other crime types studied.

AB  - The macro-level approach reemerged as a salient criminological paradigm in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Prompted by new theories and reformulations of existing ones, over 200 empirical studies explored ecological correlates of crime. Few efforts have been made, however, to "make sense" of this literature. A "meta-analysis" was undertaken to determine the relative effects of macro-level predictors of crime. Indicators of "concentrated disadvantage" (e.g., racial heterogeneity, poverty, and family disruption) are among the strongest and most stable predictors. Except for incarceration, variables indicating increased use of the criminal justice system (e.g., policing and get-tough policy effects) are among the weakest. Across all studies, social disorganization and resource/economic deprivation theories receive strong empirical support; anomie/strain, social support/social altruism, and routine activity theories receive moderate support; and deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories receive weak support.

AB  - Objectives:
   This study evaluates the relationship between employment and crime through a holistic evaluation of both treatment and treatment effect heterogeneity.
   Methods:
   This study implements a perceptual measure of job quality (job satisfaction) and hybrid fixed effects models among a sample of high-risk adults. Analyses also consider the robustness of findings across alternative operationalizations of job quality and various sample subgroups.
   Results:
   Transitioning from not working to working in the lowest quality job can be criminogenic. Among those who are working, an improvement in job quality is not generally associated with offending. However, model and crime-specific effects are observed. Evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity is also found, suggesting the effect of job quality is moderated by race/ethnicity and location.
   Conclusions:
   These findings caution criminologists against making an assumption that employment is inversely related to offending and call into question our understanding of job quality as a general disincentive for crime. Rather, evidence suggests that improvements in job quality may result in modest reductions in offending, but only for certain types of crime and certain individuals within specific labor market contexts.

AB  - We study the emergence of new forms of law violations in Latin America during the coronavirus pandemic. Based on data from online news articles, we construct a typology of "new" crimes: (1) hate or fear crimes against health workers and hospitals; (2) illegal denials of public mobility out of fear of infection; (3) looting and other traditional crimes justified by the pandemic; and (4) violations of pandemic regulations. Studies of crime during the pandemic have focused on traditional crime and have been based on rational choice theory and a routine activities approach. We argue that in order to understand the recent crime trends in Latin America, these must be accompanied by other theories of crime, together with a better understanding of the role of the State. Our typology can be a starting point for discussions and further research on the complex relationship between criminal behavior and policy responses in pandemics.

AB  - The current study investigates the modus operandi specificities for the sexual abuse against the elderly. A comparison between sex crimes against adult and elderly victims is conducted following the criminal event approach. The comparison is based on the precrime, crime, and postcrime phases of the modus operandi, operationalized through 53 variables. The sample comes from a French national police database including a total of 1,829 cases-including 130 cases of elderly sexual abuse and 1,699 cases of sexual abuse against victims aged between 18 and 45 years. Bivariate and multivariate analyses are performed to examine the differences in the two groups. Several differences are observed between the two modus operandi. Findings indicate that the precrime phase is the most important to explain these differences, and this phase of the criminal event affects the rest of the decisions taken during the crime and postcrime phases. Specifically, we have highlighted that sexual crimes against the elderly are more violent and occur more often in the victim's residence. This study suggests that offenders targeting the elderly use specific crime characteristics, and this allows to highlight practical implications in terms of investigation and offender management.

AB  - This study identifies the first crime script for unsolved stranger sexual offenses against women. The purpose is to better understand the crime-commission process of solved and unsolved stranger sexual offenses and identify potential points of intervention for prevention purposes. Crime script analysis was performed on 542 solved (n = 265) and unsolved (n = 277) cases based on police data in Queensland, Australia, followed by a comparison between solved and unsolved crime scripts. Results showed that unsolved offenses tended to be associated with the following factors: the offender fleeing/desisting, using minimal force, less intrusive sexual outcomes, and less verbal engagement with the victim. In these cases, there was a lack of information regarding forensic evidence, behavioral clues, and eyewitness leads. This highlights the relevance of focusing on situational crime prevention and policing strategies that may deter stranger sexual crimes at the earliest stages of the script.

We review studies on these relationships, focusing mostly on links between the adversity that often characterizes homelessness-the need for shelter, food, and income-and offending, victimization, and involvement with the criminal legal system. We concentrate on multivariate studies from the United States and Canada and consider research on youth and adults. We begin with a short discussion of some of the challenges of studying these relationships. We follow our review of research on homeless conditions with a summary of research that has used data from homeless samples to advance a broad array of explanations of crime; a collection that includes strain, routine activities and lifestyle exposure, differential association, social control, rational choice, life course, and criminal capital theories.

AB  - With data from random sample household surveys conducted simultaneously in major cities in Greece and in Russia, we evaluate the import of individuals' morality relative to expected utility and self-control in predicting criminal probability. In addition, we examine potential interactions among the three variables in predicting criminal propensity and compare their relative effects across the two samples. The results suggest that all three factors are important and mostly independent influences in explaining criminal probability. However, the estimated effects of morality are substantially stronger than those of either expected utility or self-control, and all three of these explanatory variables appear to be somewhat sensitive to cultural contexts. Overall, our findings confirm that morality plays a comparatively larger part in explaining conformity than is generally recognized by major contemporary theories, although the data cannot show whether morality is an element in rational decision making or represents a contrary "non-rational" element in accounting for human conduct.

AB  - Recent research in the "crime at places'' literature is concerned with smaller units of analysis than conventional spatial criminology. An important issue is whether the spatial patterns observed in conventional spatial criminology focused on neighborhoods remain when the analysis shifts to street segments. In this article, the authors use a new spatial point pattern test that identifies the similarity in spatial point patterns. This test is local in nature such that the output can be mapped showing where differences are present. Using this test, the authors investigate the stability of crime patterns moving from census tracts to dissemination areas to street segments. The authors find that general crime patterns are somewhat similar at all spatial scales, but finer scales of analysis reveal significant variations within larger units. This result demonstrates the importance of analyzing crime patterns at small scales and has important implications for further theoretical development and policy implementation.

   Results: The results show that immediate spatial neighbors are important for understanding local crime patterns. Though (positive) spatial autocorrelation has long been known to be present with crime data, this analysis suggests that negative spatial autocorrelation (if present) has a significantly different implication. Generally speaking, when predicting a local crime cluster type, the immediate spatial neighbors are more important for correct prediction. As such, a low local crime area that is surrounded by high crime areas presents itself as a high crime area in the regression results.
   Conclusions: Therefore, efforts to understand the criminal nature of an area must not consider that area in isolation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose
   In early 2020, the world faced a rapid life-changing pandemic in the form of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Citywide lockdowns with stay-at-home orders and mass closings quickly became the "new normal." With these new mandates, routine activity, mental health and financial securities all began to experience major deviations, and it became clear that this could prove to be rather valuable in providing the opportunity for large-scale criminology experiments. This study aims to explore New York City's (NYC) crime patterns during this unique social situation. Specifically, has crime as a whole increased or decreased, and have particular crimes increased or decreased during these stressful fluid times?
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors briefly review previous crises and worldwide trends but focus on NYC crime as collected by the New York Police Department's statistics unit, "CompStat." An analysis of 13 crime types from March 30 to July 5 was completed, including percent differences and individual weekly incidence rates in citywide crimes compared to the same time in 2019.
   Findings
   The analysis demonstrated that all crimes analyzed, except for murder and burglary, exhibited a statistically significant difference during COVID-19 conditions compared to the same time the previous year. Grand larceny auto and gun violence crimes significantly increased during COVID-19 weeks, whereas rape, other sex crimes, robbery, felony assault, grand larceny, transit, housing, misdemeanor assault and petit larceny all significantly decreased.
   Originality/value
   Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, this is amongst the first studies to examine trends in NYC crime during pandemic mandates. Expanding our knowledge in these situations can inform natural disaster responses, as well as criminal justice policy and practice to better protect the public in future crises.

AB  - Informed by rational choice theory, this paper identifies the factors that predict illegal sales of tobacco to under age youth. Data for this study are based on 439 merchant compliance checks in Ontario. At the bivariate level, our analysis reveals that enforcement activity has a significant negative effect on sales to miners. This effect, however, is slightly weakened with the introduction of background factors (i.e., rural/urban distinction, type of business operation), and all but eliminated once event factors are taken into consideration. The event factors which have the strongest independent effects on sales are: time of day (evening), age and gender composition of the youth attempting to purchase, and the legal compliance behaviour of tobacco merchants (asking for age and ID). These findings help to support a rational choice model of offending, and suggest that the situational context of the criminal event relates strongly to decisions to offend. In addition, our research suggests potential policy changes to reduce the illegal distribution and sale of tobacco to minors.

AB  - This study pursues two important goals: 1) assessment of the offender-victim overlap in non-Western cultural contexts and 2) examination of complex moderating influences and mediating factors that help explain the relationship between offending and victimization. Interview data from 700 Ukrainian and 735 Russian adults are used to assess main and interactive effects of theoretical predictors on violent and property offending. Findings reveal a moderate relationship between victimization and offending partially explained by association with deviant peers, self-control, and angry emotions. Moreover, association with deviant peers, depression, and anger appear to condition the relationship. Analyses support and clarify the victim-offender overlap, suggesting it is a universal phenomenon crossing national contexts and that the likelihood of a crime victim becoming an offender is influenced by individual traits, peer relationships, and contemporaneous emotional affect shaping behavioral responses to criminal victimization.

AB  - The research deals with operationalization of main macro-level theories of crime. Basing on annual data concerning property crimes in Poland in the years 1970-2008, and employing general to specific strategy of modeling, seven structural models were estimated whose specifications rest on the following theories of crime: social disorganization theory, anomie, social conflict, routine activities theory, rational choice, social support, and subcultural theory. Although the initial set of explanatory variables was the same across all the models, the final set of regressors - corresponding to a given theory - differs across the models and so do the estimates. Moreover, each of the seven models passes numerous tests of statistical and essential acceptance. In effect, one ends up in an "oversupply" of hypotheses and practical use of the empirical outcomes based on various criminological doctrines is impeded unless one sympathizes with a given theory.
   An alternative to the afore-mentioned selection procedure is a unification approach which allows for the inherent uncertainty present while searching for 'the best model' because it uses all the information contained in all the models considered. The approach rests on the information theory, whereas the frequentist model averaging enables its practical implementation. This technique explicitly takes into account the impact of all the explanatory variables gathered as relevant in view of alternative theories of crime. Then one cannot raise the argument of bias caused by omitting any adequate variables.
   In the light of the results obtained in the research, the most significant variables affecting the property crime in Poland are best rooted in the deterrence theory as well as in the routine activities theory. Consequently, preventive and operation actions aimed at curbing crime should benefit from the conclusions and solutions proposed by these theories.

AB  - Crime changes have been reported as a result of human routine activity shifting due to containment policies, such as stay-at-home (SAH) mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the way in which the manifestation of crime in both space and time is affected by dynamic human activities has not been explored in depth in empirical studies. Here, we aim to quantitatively measure the spatio-temporal stratified associations between crime patterns and human activities in the context of an unstable period of the ever-changing socio-demographic backcloth. We propose an analytical framework to detect the stratified associations between dynamic human activities and crimes in urban areas. In a case study of San Francisco, United States, we first identify human activity zones (HAZs) based on the similarity of daily footfall signatures on census block groups (CBGs). Then, we examine the spatial associations between crime spatial distributions at the CBG-level and the HAZs using spatial stratified heterogeneity statistical measurements. Thirdly, we use different temporal observation scales around the effective date of the SAH mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate the dynamic nature of the associations. The results reveal that the spatial patterns of most crime types are statistically significantly associated with that of human activities zones. Property crime exhibits a higher stratified association than violent crime across all temporal scales. Further, the strongest association is obtained with the eight-week time span centred around the SAH order. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the relationships between urban crime and human activities, but also offer insights into that tailored crime intervention strategies need to consider human activity variables.

AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences.

AB  - Researchers modeling offender travel patterns typically assume that crime locations are well within the offenders' activity space. Using information about the places frequented by 2,563 delinquent youths residing in Southern California, this study examined distances traveled to delinquent and nondelinquent hangout locations. Travel to known delinquent sites was substantively farther from home than expected and exhibited a segmented nonlinear curve, joining logarithmic and negative exponential functions. Significant variation was found for place-specific (trip distance) and person-specific (individual travel) distances by city classification, travel method, and age cohort; age effects disappeared in multivariate analyses. Several implications follow, highlighting the need to infuse a place-oriented approach to studying journey-to-crime.

AB  - Crime pattern theory claims that busy places generate crime through immediate and delayed exploitation. In delayed exploitation, offenders notice criminal opportunities during opening hours but return to exploit them later. This study investigates delayed exploitation by testing whether soccer stadiums locally increase police-recorded property crime on non-game days. A soccer stadium closure created a natural experiment. We estimate linear regression difference-in-difference models to compare crime rates on non-game days around the stadium, before and after the closure. The closure reduced non-game day property crime beyond the citywide property crime drop. We conclude that criminogenic effects of busy places extend beyond their opening hours, confirming the delayed exploitation mechanism and that crime-prevention strategies should also target these places outside opening hours.

AB  - Features of the environment including activity nodes and the level of connectivity in spaces help offenders develop awareness spaces for criminal opportunities. Based on arguments forwarded by Felson, the current study argues these environmental features also facilitate convergence spaces that promote interaction among offenders that increase the likelihood of group crime. Data include street connectivity measures from the Environmental Protection Agency and publicly available arrest information from Baltimore City (2013-16). Findings provide support for the influence of certain activity nodes and pedestrian-oriented street connectivity in explaining group crime. The discussion evaluates how crime pattern theory can be extended to understand the social nature of crime.

AB  - Objectives To investigate how peer dynamics, specifically interpersonal conversations between a potential offender and a peer, contemporaneous with a crime opportunity, influence perceptions of sanction certainty and social costs. Methods Data are analyzed from randomized experiments and hypothetical vignettes embedded within a nationwide, online survey (n = 1,275). Vignettes were presented for three distinct crime opportunities, drunk driving, fighting, and insurance fraud. Results The findings suggest that respondents adjust two core decision-making perceptions-the perceived certainty of being legally sanctioned and perceived social costs such as stigma or embarrassment-in accord with the content of verbal communications from peers. There is evidence for this both between and within subjects. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of accounting for both physical and social features of the situational context for crime in models of offender decision making. Implications are drawn regarding the social milieu for offender decision making, and the broader criminological relevance of choice principles.

AB  - Based on a wide version of rational choice theory, the paper aims at explaining and empirically analysing criminal action in a situation-specific manner as the result of a two-stage decision process. Theoretically, we draw special attention to the relevance of utility components for criminal decision making, while the empirical focus is on the formulation of an adequate statistical model for two-stage sequential decision processes. Empirical analyses are based on data collected by means of a mail survey (n = 2,383) of a disproportionally stratified random sample of residents from an East German city. For hypothesis testing, we estimate a series of sequential logit-models from the general class of discrete choice models (Hensher et al. 2005; Train 2009). Results indicate that aspects of utility guide actions on both stages of the decision process. Finally, these implications are being discussed from a theoretical and methodological perspective.

AB  - This study examined the previous criminal behaviour of individuals who were arrested for violating the drug driving over the prescribed limit offence, introduced into the UK in March 2015. The sample consists of individuals arrested during the first year of enforcement of this offence from March 2015 to March 2016 within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Metropolitan Police Service in London. The previous criminal behaviour of the research subjects was framed within a number of criminological theories and there is examination of any correlation between their criminal history and the drug-driving offence they had been arrested for. The criminal activity was obtained from each individual's criminal record held on the police national computer and coded with regards to offence groups. As well as criminal sanctions, there was also an examination of drug-related arrest histories. The results indicate a high level of previous criminal activity with drugs and driving matters dominating that activity. This supports the construct that, in this context, drug driving fits within their patterns of offending.

AB  - This study examines whether radical eco-groups have been deterred by legal sanctions. From a rational choice framework, I argue that members of these groups weigh costs and benefits. I measure an increase in costs, or an objective deterrence effect, through four federal sentencing acts targeted at reducing the criminal behavior of these groups [the tree-spiking clause of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADA), the Animal Enterprise Protection Act (AEPA), the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), and the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA)] and hypothesize that this legislation decreased the hazard of subsequent attacks.
   This research is a quasi-experimental design utilizing the 1,068 illegal incidents perpetrated in the name of the environment, animal, or both as extracted from the Eco-Incidents Database. Using series hazard modeling, I examine the time until the next incident, serious incident, and ideologically specific incident in relation to dummy variables operationalizing the enactment dates of the above legislation.
   All in all, the results are somewhat consistent with a rational choice framework and my hypotheses. The ADA decreased the hazard of another attack (11 %) and environment-only attack (15 %), while at the same time increasing the hazard of a terrorist, damage, and animal-related attack. AETA decreased the hazard of all (47 %), damage (42 %), and the behavior it was aimed at, that of animal-only incidents (52 %). However, neither the AEPA, nor AEDPA had a significant effect on any of the outcomes.
   Overall, radical eco-groups were deterred by legal sanctions, but these findings are legislation and outcome specific in addition to including displacement effects.

AB  - Spatial analysis of criminal incidents is an old and important technique used by crime analysts. However, most of this analysis considers the aggregate behavior of criminals. rather, than individual spatial behavior. Recent advances in the modeling of spatial choice and data mining now enable us to better understand and predict individual criminal behavior in the context of their environment. In this paper, we provide a methodology to analyze and predict the spatial behavior of criminals by combining data mining techniques and the theory of discrete choice. The models based on this approach are shown to improve the prediction of future crime locations when compared to traditional shot spot analysis.

KW  - rational choice theory
KW  - routine activity theory
AB  - This paper argues for the relevance of classical criminology for addressing contemporary problems of the criminal justice system. Despite many fundamental differences in political and cultural contexts, the central themes of classical criminology continue to be relevant for our time. One such theme is the criticism of criminal law for imposing very harsh penalties. Penalties become cruel if they produce fear rather than moral responsibility. Criminal laws based on fear rather than conscience and reason are the expressions of political tyranny. The importance of developing moral responsibility has been reflected in a number of contemporary criminological theories. They, however, differ from classical criminology in one important aspect. Contemporary criminology, even though accepting the importance of morality in preventing crimes, does not affirm the existence of a moral truth. Classical criminology, as developed by Beccaria and Bentham, is based on a belief in moral truth as the criterion for evaluating contemporary institutions of criminal law. One instance of moral truth is that crimes are acts of free will. In contrast, many contemporary criminological theories do not recognize the concept of free will, which still remains the underlying principle of responsibility in criminal law. Rational choice theory is an exception. The paper highlights some shortcomings of the classical and rational choice theories from the viewpoint of a criminal law theorist. However, these shortcomings do not reduce the overriding importance of the unity of law, morals, and criminology. In order to reach a greater unity between the disciplines of criminology and criminal law, there is a need for the return to, and the acceptance of the main ethical tenets of classical criminology.

AB  - Our collective understanding of criminal mobility relies almost exclusively on journey-to-crime research, which focuses on the distances traveled by offenders from their homes to the location of their crimes. In this article, we ask whether the theoretical relevance and the methodological validity underlying the journey-to-crime measurement are sufficient for it to continue to be a leading influence in the field of environmental criminology. Based on a critical review of the foundations of journey-to-crime research, we argue that while the interest in the journey-to-crime measurement is understandable, there are better ways to assess criminal mobility. Some likely misleading implicit presuppositions and methodological biases are identified, and the manner in which they affect our comprehension of criminal mobility is discussed. We suggest that a better understanding of criminal mobility would come from complementing journey-to-crime with new and more refined measures. Implications for future studies are proposed.

AB  - Based on an offender spatial decision-making perspective, this burglary target location choice study aims to understand how physical and social barriers affect why residential burglars commit their crimes at particular locations in a major Chinese city. Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes.

AB  - Ample research in criminology investigates the role of deviant peers in the development of adolescent offending. Different theoretical explanations account for distinct peer influences. The socialization perspective argues that deviant peers influence behavior through the provision of norms and values, whereas the situational perspective argues that deviant peers provide situational opportunities for deviant behavior. This study partially retests the propositions put forward by Thomas and McGloin's study of dual systems, differential peer effects, and adolescent offending. We address the question to what extent trait impulsivity affects social and situational peer processes controlling for parental supervision, family bond, school bond, and deviant norms. Analysis of the cross-national International Self-Report Delinquency Study (ISRD3) data suggests that adolescents at the edges of trait impulsivity are differentially vulnerable to the effects of deviant peer processes. However, the findings need to be nuanced. We discuss the contribution of the current study to a better understanding of the interplay between individual characteristics and exposure to deviant peers.

AB  - Criminal gangs, insurgent groups, and terror networks demonstrate observable preferences in selecting the sites where they commit their crimes. Accordingly, police departments, military organizations, and intelligence agencies seek to learn these preferences and identify locations with a high probability of experiencing the particular event of interest in the near future. Often, such agencies are keen not just to predict the spatial pattern of future events but even more importantly to conduct threat assessments of particular criminal gangs or insurgent groups. These threat assessments include identifying where each of the various groups presents the greatest threat to the community, what the most likely targets are for each criminal group, what makes one location more likely to experience an attack than another, and how to most efficiently allocate resources to address the specific threats to the community. Previous research has demonstrated that applying multivariate prediction models to relate features in an area to the occurrence of crimes offers an improvement in predictive performance over traditional methods of hot-spot analysis. This paper introduces the application of multilevel modeling to these multivariate spatial choice models, demonstrating that it is possible to significantly improve the predictive performance of the spatial choice models for individual groups and leverage that information to provide improved threat assessments of the criminal elements in a given geographic area.

AB  - Although there has been a great deal of theoretical and empirical research on the causes and distribution of homicide during the past 30 years, almost all of this research has excluded from consideration the relationship between homicide and alcohol consumption.  Based on theoretical analysis, a U.S. state-level study was conducted to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between alcohol and homicide from four major theoretical perspectives; specific predictions based on previous research on the causes of types of homicide were also derived.  Five types of homicide rates were examined, with findings revealing that alcohol consumption rates change the way important predictors such as poverty and deterrence are related to specific types of homicide.  Alcohol consumption has important direct net effects on two types of primary homicide, and alcohol regulation was found to interact with other forms of social control like capital punishment.  Support was also found for a rational choice-based interaction between alcohol consumption and the application of death sentences.  The article concludes with a discussion of the value of theoretical analysis, particularly when applied to the prediction of interactions.

AB  - The age-crime curve has been regarded as a stylized fact of the age-crime relationship. However, recent studies have found that some Asian countries have an age-crime distribution that deviates from the archetypal age-crime curve. This variation has been attributed to cultural factors associated with age effects. Using age-specific arrest data from Korea for the years 1976 through 2019, this study offers a complementary explanation of divergent age-crime patterns across countries. We make an empirical case that the observed difference between the Korean age-crime distribution and the archetypical age-crime curve in Western countries cannot be due to contextual influence on age effects alone. The age-crime relationship in Korea shows both static and dynamic characteristics. The age-period-cohort analysis of variance shows that age effects largely explain the age-crime relationship, but period and cohort effects also explain the change in the age-crime relationship over time. Moreover, the extent to which each effect manifests depends on the type of crime. Based on our findings, we propose hypotheses regarding the role of social context in shaping each effect. We suggest that cultural factors largely shaped age effects by creating age-graded changes in the social control mechanism and in routine activities. In addition, we suggest that other contextual factors, such as population dynamics, simultaneously shaped period and cohort effects by changing the level of social control, and routine activities across birth cohorts. Both cultural and historical dimensions of social context are required to understand divergent age-crime patterns across countries.

AB  - We argue that a rational choice framework can be used to explain declines in offending from adolescence to young adulthood in two ways. First, subjective expectations of offending can be age graded such that perceptions of rewards decrease and perceptions of risks and costs increase. Second, the marginal (dis)utility of crime may be age graded (e.g., preferences for risks, costs, and rewards). We examine changes in offending from adolescence to young adulthood among a subset of individuals from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 585) and employ a nonlinear decomposition model to partition differences in offending attributable to changing subjective expectations (X) and changing marginal utilities (beta). The results indicate that both have direct and independent effects on changes in offending over time. The results of a detailed decomposition on the subjective expectations also indicate that differences exist across the type of incentives. That is, the effect of changing expectations is attributed mainly to changes in perceived rewards (both social and intrinsic). Changing expectations of social costs and risk of arrest from offending have weak effects on changes in criminal behavior, which suggests that they must be accompanied by increases in the weight placed on these expectations to promote appreciable declines in offending.

AB  - Rational choice theories (RCTs) of crime assume actors behave in an instrumental, outcome-oriented way. Accordingly, individuals should weight the costs and benefits of criminal acts with subjective probabilities that these outcomes will occur. Previous studies either do not directly test this central hypothesis or else yield inconsistent results. We show that a meaningful test can be conducted only if a broader view is adopted that takes into account the interplay of moral norms and instrumental incentives. Such a view can be derived from the Model of Frame Selection (Kroneberg, 2005) and the Situational Action Theory of Crime Causation (Wikstrom, 2004). Based on these theories, we analyze the willingness to engage in shoplifting and tax fraud in a sample of 2,130 adults from Dresden, Germany. In line with our theoretical expectations, we find that only respondents who do not feel bound by moral norms show the kind of instrumental rationality assumed in RCTs of crime. Where norms have been strongly internalized, and in the absence of neutralizations, instrumental incentives are irrelevant.

AB  - Research focusing on deterrence has stressed the negative relationship between perceived formal sanctions and criminal behavior, ignoring the possibility that in some populations formal sanctions may serve to increase offending under some conditions. Utilizing a sample of 300 homeless street youths, the study explores if violent peers, violent values, and the culture of the street moderates the association between perceived legal sanctions and violent offending. The results suggest that violent peers, violent values, and the culture of the street condition the perceived certainty of punishment so that it leads to higher levels of violence. Further, the culture of the street conditions the relationship between perceived severity of punishment and violence. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

AB  - Research on the formation of sanction risk perceptions has concentrated virtually exclusively on the bases of legal sanction perceptions. This article examines the correlates of extralegal risk perceptions. Theoretical arguments relate previous offending experiences to current perceptions of self-imposed (guilt) and socially imposed (social disapproval) sanctions. The empirical implications of these arguments are tested. Findings indicate that individuals' perceptions of the risk of social disapproval are associated with their own offending experiences, and individuals' perceptions of the risk of guilt are associated with their friends', as well as their own offending experiences. The findings suggest that research on the formation and modification of sanction risk perceptions should not be limited to perceptions of legal sanctions.

AB  - This paper presents a method for analyzing patterns of criminal activity that occur in space and time. The method uses the fuzzy C-means algorithm to cluster criminal events in space. In addition, a cluster reorganization algorithm is included to preserve the order of fuzzy partitions from one time step analysis to another. Order preservation is possible since crime forms relatively stable patterns due to the fixed shape of urban spaces and routine activities of people. The method provides a novel way to analyze criminal directionality, since it generates time series from clustering. A sample database of robberies in San Francisco, USA, is used to test the algorithm. Results show that criminal patterns might be tracked in a simple way.

AB  - The rise in prescription drug abuse is changing crime patterns among drug users and the structure of illegal drug markets. The illegal distribution of prescription drugs is different from traditional street drug markets because prescription drugs can be obtained from multiple sources including doctors, pharmacies, friends, and street-level dealers. Drawing from drug-market research, this article investigates whether there are individual and ecological predictors of how prescription drugs are illegally obtained. Our study uses multilevel analyses to examine a random sample of 366 drug offenders arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona. Our findings indicate that individual-level characteristics such as mental illness and street drug use, as well as residential mobility within neighborhoods, are significant predictors of how prescription drugs are obtained for nonmedical purposes. This research suggests that an individual's routine activities and neighborhood characteristics are related to their methods for obtaining prescription drugs. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, statistical methods have been applied to the study of crime patterns. However, these schemes have several drawbacks that prevent accurate modeling of complex behaviors. Agent-based models (ABM) allow the modeling of human behavior by employing simple rules that consider each agent's neighborhood. In this paper, a new agent-based model is proposed to emulate crime patterns produced by the interaction of different urban actors, such as offenders (criminals), citizens, and defenders (police officers). Using this approach, the simulation results provide escape trajectories and robbery frequencies that can be used to create or improve public security strategies. Although our scheme can be generically applied, we validated the model by considering different scenarios for the case of Guadalajara, Mexico. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme creates realistic offender behaviors that efficiently predict criminal patterns and provides essential data that allow the creation and improvement of public security strategies to reduce the number of crimes.

AB  - Near repeat analysis has been increasingly used to measure the spatiotemporal clustering of crime in contemporary criminology. Despite its predictive capacity, the typically short time frame of near repeat crime patterns can negatively affect the crime prevention utility of near repeat analysis. Thus, recent research has argued for a greater understanding of the types of places that are most likely to generate near repeat crime patterns. The current study contributes to the literature through a spatiotemporal analysis of residential burglary and motor vehicle theft in Indianapolis, IN. Near Repeat analyses were followed by multinomial logistic regression models to identify covariates related to the occurrence of initiator (the first event in a near repeat chain) and near repeat (the subsequent event in a near repeat chain) events. The overall findings provide additional support for the argument that neighborhood context can influence the formation and context of spatiotemporal crime patterns.

AB  - Criminologists have long grappled with the varying effect of sanctions. In an effort to clarify these divergent effects, Sherman (1993) delineated a general theory of sanction effects, termed defiance theory. Defiance theory anticipates that there are four necessary conditions for defiance to occur: (a) the sanction must be perceived as unfair; (b) the offender must be poorly bonded; (c) the sanction must be perceived as stigmatizing; and (d) the offender denies the shame produced by the sanction. This study provides one of the first empirical assessments of defiance theory. In addition, defiance theory is examined within the life-course perspective, and analyses address trajectories of offending. Using data from the 1945 Philadelphia Birth Cohort, the results yield promising support for the theory.

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender-Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.

AB  - The goal of this current systematic review was to describe the characteristics of the modus operandi of serial and nonserial sexual murderers, and the contextual and situational factors associated with them. It analyzes detailed data on 1836 sexual murderers (serial sexual murderers = 176; nonserial sexual murderers = 1660) taken from 45 empirical descriptive studies carried out between 1985 and 2013. In order to better characterize serial sexual murderers (SSMs) and nonserial sexual murderers (NSM5), four categories of variables were established: precrime variables; crime scene and modus operandi variables; postcrime variables; and victimology variables. Sexual murder possesses specific choice-structuring properties, and interactions between internal constraints and external constraints produce a limited number of crime scripts. SSMs' modus operandi refiectssadistic sexual fantasies, sexual sadism, and organization. SSMs plan their murders in order to make them as congruent as possible with their fantasies. NSMs' modus operandi is the result of an explosion of anger. These sexual murderers are impulsive and extremely violent, and use sexual murder to diminish their internal tension (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions.

AB  - Research Summary Privatized corrections and cost-benefit analyses have both been around for a long time in American criminal justice policy and practice. Accordingly, in this article, I review the cost-benefit literature on correctional privatization with respect to three primary issues: (1) what we know from the cost-benefit analyses that have been conducted thus far regarding privatized corrections, (2) the key gaps and challenges that should be addressed if we are to truly understand the "social ledger" associated with privatizing correctional services, and (3) key lessons learned regarding the limited role that cost-benefit analysis plays in policy discussions about punishment policy. Policy Implications The primary implication for policy is that, for the most part, what we know about the cost-effectiveness of privatized corrections has been confined to studies of private prisons. Alternatively, on balance, we know little about the cost-effectiveness of privatized corrections more generally. And even if rigorous cost-benefit analyses did exist in larger quantities, they would still have to face the strong ideological commitment that both proponents and opponents of privatized corrections seem to hold.

AB  - Purpose: To examine a component of crime pattern theory by exploring whether the spatial predictors of crime vary across seasons.
   Methods: The relationships among potentially criminogenic places and illicit markets and seasonal census block robbery counts in Philadelphia, PA, were explored using simultaneously estimated negative binomial regression models. The equality of predictors' effects on street robbery across seasons was subsequently tested using Wald's tests.
   Results: While many facilities and illicit markets were positively associated with street robbery, there were few seasonal differences in their effects. Only the effect of high schools during the fall was greater than during the winter and summer as hypothesized.
   Conclusions: The results suggest areas with facilities and illicit markets that are used consistently across the year experience the highest street robbery levels regardless of the season.

AB  - Empirical results on the deterrent impact of criminal sanctions are generally disenchanting. Population samples reveal negligible effects of expected sanctioning severity and only modest effects of perceived sanction certainty on measures of criminal activity. Consequently, the concept of differential deterrability - the idea that individuals differ in their responsiveness to sanction threats gains prominence in perceptual deterrence research. The present article provides an overview of the evidence base of differential deterrability. There is indication that individuals who hold weak moral beliefs, possess low self-control and have many delinquent friends are more susceptible to a crime-reducing impact of perceived sanction risk. The observation that those burdened with risk factors for crime are moderately responsive to the risk of legal punishment support a certain suitability of criminal law as instrument of secondary prevention.

AB  - Sex offenders are a heterogeneous group and exhibit various offense patterns. Often the location where the offender committed the offense is different from where the offender encountered their victim. Applying crime pattern theory, this study sought to understand if the type of location, victim, and situational characteristics could predict whether an offender would commit the sexual offense in a different and more secluded location than where he first encountered the victim. Among a sample of 114 incarcerated sex offenders, the results showed that offenders who contacted their victims in locations where children are known to congregate were more than 4 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location to complete the sexual offense. Those who used noncoercive strategies (e.g., bribes, seduction) during the offense process were approximately 7 times more likely to travel to a more secluded location that those who did not. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Purpose This paper investigated the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations on the spatial distribution of commercial burglary in San Francisco.
   Method Geocoded commercial burglary data for 2003-2021 from San Francisco were analyzed using the Andresen Spatial Point Pattern Test to examine potential spatial movement in commercial burglary.
   Results Concentrations of commercial burglary spatially shifted following the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent stay-at-home orders. Original hot spots experienced a relative decrease in commercial burglary, and crime spread out throughout the city. These spatial changes in commercial burglary appear to be related to variations in guardianship and criminal opportunity.
   Conclusion These findings suggest that the dramatic shifts in routine activities resulting from the COVID-19 policies could disrupt spatial burglary patterns, especially burglary clustering. Law enforcement should consider the spatial dynamics of commercial burglary, as well as land use heterogeneity, to effectively respond to crime during periods of social distancing and business shutdowns.

AB  - Theft is the most recurrent crime in Barcelona and causes a perception of public insecurity that generates the need to create prevention and intervention strategies by the police, being of great help the geographic profile. The main objective of this research is to establish the geospatial profile of a sample of thieves, through an empirical, descriptive and applied study, in which the quantitative method is used. It started from an initial sample of 66 shoplifters to analyze the characteristics of the distances from home to theft, and a second sample of 15 to analyze the characterization of commuters vs. marauders, as well as the safety zone and the decay distance. Coinciding with the theory, night robbers live closer to the place of theft than daytime robbers, most of them reside in the metropolitan area and steal about 5 km from their home; they are distributed equally between commuters and marauders, traveling the latter shorter distances and committing offenses on a recurring basis. Specifically in Barcelona, three out of ten robs within 70 days after the theft, and the marauders, between a range located 0.36 km from the home (safety zone) up to approximately 3 km (decay distance).

AB  - Since the Agent-based simulation tool was introduced into criminology research, most work concentrated on crime theory validation or hypothesis testing, little was contributed to crime spatial pattern replication. In this paper, using street network and subway network as the landscape and proposing a statistic-based instead of predefined human mobility pattern as the individual's routine activity, the spatial distribution of burglary in Beijing is simulated and valid by the actual pattern. The result indicates that the Agent-based modeling method partly detects the crime hotspots and the spatial pattern of crime, and specifically the crime level on the nodes with different accessibility is proved to be identical to the actual one. The study made in this work demonstrates that Agent-based modeling is a potential tool to predict or explain crime pattern in space, and also some further work which aims to improve its validation is discussed in the end of this paper.

AB  - Objectives: Criminal target choice has been described as a multistage process: An offender first selects a suitable area from a set of alternatives and then chooses a specific target. This article studies area selection and attempts to distinguish between crime generators/visit detractors (elements that could affect anyone) and crime attractors/offense detractors (elements that affect offenders specifically).
   Methods: Trips that resulted in violent or property crimes between 506 census tracts in a large city (n = 11,411) are analyzed. Multilevel negative binomial regression is used to assess the impact of measures relating to pairs of tracts and characteristics of destination tracts.
   Results: Various factors are significantly related to the number of crime-associated trips per pair of tracts: differences in reward (residential and visiting population size, presence of schools or bars), differences in effort (distance between tracts, major roads linking both tracts), and differences in risk (level of social disorganization).
   Conclusions: This article supports an opportunistic perspective on crime: Crime-associated trips are more likely when advantages are high and risks and efforts are low.

AB  - This paper proposes a placement model for closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to effectively monitor criminal activity on pedestrian streets in student safety zones in South Korea. Although pedestrian streets around schools are potential crime sites, the legal management of and supervisory responsibility for these areas are ill-deined. The increasing demand for public supervision in student safety zones requires the effective control of high-cost CCTV systems. The rational choice perspective and routine activity approach can be used to explain attackers' preferences for criminal activities and the accompanying situational characteristics. Surveillance conditions differ depending on the pedestrian low and immediate environment. The spatial properties derived from the pedestrian street network affect pedestrian low. In addition, visibility of the physical environment affects natural surveillance and mechanical surveillance. Quantitative research is presented on the needs for surveillance considering these properties, and a placement model for public CCTV cameras is proposed that uses a genetic algorithm. Following an analysis of surveillance conditions, the model provides information describing the placement and mechanical operation of surveillance cameras. CCTV cameras are routinely installed in student safety zones; the proposed model should contribute to the effective planning and installation of these cameras.

AB  - Research addressing the link between crime and parks has primarily focused on fear of crime with limited empirical research verifying or denying a crime-park relationship. This article examines the results of two nearly identical studies examining the relationship between neighborhood parks and crime, in two very dissimilar cities, Philadelphia, PA and Louisville, KY. These cities vary greatly in size, population density, median income, per cent minorities and per cent living in poverty, among other factors. Findings of the studies, which are grounded in theories of environmental criminology, show that neighborhood parks are associated with increased crime levels in their immediate surroundings. In addition, although characteristics of parks significantly related to crime levels in each city vary somewhat, findings clearly demonstrate the underlying importance guardianship plays is explaining the criminogenic nature of neighborhood parks.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that the presence of others shifts decision-making about risky/deviant behavior. One reason for this shift could be changes in the anticipated experience of formal sanctions, informal costs, and rewards. To investigate this possibility, this study conducted two randomized controlled trials with hypothetical vignettes, in which a range of how many other people were also involved in the criminal act defined the treatment conditions. Across two samples of university students (Ns = 396 and 263), the results revealed that as the size of the involved group increased, the anticipated experience of sanction risk and several informal social costs associated with engaging in the act decreased, and the anticipated experience of two rewards increased. Additional analyses suggest that, with one exception in each data set, these changes are not only tied to the solo/group distinction.

AB  - This paper examines the accounts of NYC marijuana smokers about the information and values underlying decisions about where to smoke. We do so to assess the deterrent value of NYC's "quality of life" policing of marijuana in public view. Participants indicated a general awareness of escalated marijuana policing and its attendant risks and almost universally spoke of avoiding public use in high-traffic locations and in the city's cultural and commercial centres. Beyond that, however, the deterrent value of aggressive marijuana policing appears limited. Individuals without access to private space reported outdoor marijuana use as a normalized peer group activity that has increasingly been displaced to marginal and interstitial public spaces that were collectively referred to by participants as "the cut."

AB  - Environmental criminology theory has established that crime is non-random across time and spac, instead clustering in specific, predictable ways. This has resulted m the development of theories that have helped generate a suite of highly effective, targeted crime prevention tools. Although access to high-quality temporal and spatial fire event data has improved in recent decades, the nexus between spatial/temporal clustering, theory, and targeted fire prevention remains largely unexplored. To address this, the current paper compares the temporal and spatial distributions of residential structure fire and residential burglary within a North American city over a three year period. This analysis reveals (a) overlapping spatial clustering for these two incident types, and (b) distinct temporal patterns; all of which can be explained by the logic underpinning environmental criminology theory. The extrapolation of these findings to targeted fire prevention is discussed with respect to the opportunity this presents for the fire service. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deterrence theory and criminal justice policy hold that punishment enhances compliance and deters future criminal activity. Empirical research, however, is decidedly mixed, with some studies finding that punishment weakens compliance, some finding that sanctions have no effect on compliance, and some finding that the effect of sanctions depends on moderating factors. In this review, we do not consider whether sanctions affect compliance but instead consider the conditions under which sanctions affect compliance. Specifically, we focus on understanding the kinds-of-people dimension of sanctions and deterrence to include individual differences (in social bonding, morality, discount rate, impulsivity, social network position, decision-making competence) and situational differences (in emotions, alcohol/drug use). Upon reviewing the empirical evidence, we identify important gaps for theoretical and empirical work and comment on how this work relates to public policy.

AB  - We investigate the concept of "criminal failure" in sexual crimes and the relevance of various theoretical frameworks for its understanding: individual offender's rational choice, environmental influences and routine activities, victimological characteristics from lifestyle theory, and crime interaction factors. We examined a sample of 1121 "failed" cases (i.e., attempted but not completed) and 1500 "successful" cases (i.e., completed) of sexual assault that occurred in France between 1990 and 2018. We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime. This understudied area can yield important theoretical knowledge and practical implications regarding the prevention of sexual crimes.

AB  - The study utilized the official police data that included the robbery incident addresses/spots to explore the incidence, volume, trends, and patterns of robbery in Ghana from 2014 to 2017. There were 5696 robbery cases of which the highest, 1772 cases, were recorded in 2017, and the lowest cases, 1116 recorded in 2014 reported to the police during this period. The daily average robberies were 3 cases in 2014, 4 cases each in 2015 and 2016, and 5 cases in 2017. The robbery per 100,000 of population in 2014 was 4.1 persons. In 2015, the rate was 5 persons, in 2016 the rate was 4.9 persons and in 2017 it was 6 persons per 100,000 of population. The highest robbery cases were recorded in December, followed by November, September, and May. The Greater Accra region recorded the highest robberies, followed by the Ashanti region, which had the most robbery flashpoints/spots. The Accra-Tema metroplex in the Greater Accra region recorded the highest robbery cases, followed by the city of Kumasi in the Ashanti region. Robbery, an expropriative and serious acquisitive crime whose primary motif is financial gain appears to feed on lifestyles, opportunities, routines, and activities of people. While the arrest rate was small, the robbery related crimes, including robbery -deaths, rapes, and other injuries brought fear and panic among the citizenry. Ghana's robbery statutes, and law enforcement responses, including shooting death of suspects, and public lynching of some suspects do not appear to deter the robbery menace. The sources of the assault weapons used in the robberies, the robbery typologies, and the official crime gathering processes need further studies.

AB  - Scholars have long emphasized that communicating, or "advertising", information about legal sanction risk is necessary for the success of deterrence-based crime policies. However, scant research has evaluated whether direct communications about legal risk can cause sanction perception updating, the updating of ambiguity in sanction perceptions, or changes in persons' willingness to offend. No prior studies have evaluated sanction perception updating for white-collar crimes.
   To address this research void, the current study analyzes data from an experiment embedded in a recent national survey (N = 878). Multivariate regression models estimate the effect of providing participants with information about the "objective" arrest risk for white-collar offenses on their sanction perceptions.
   The findings provide the first evidence that such information, when it is inconsistent with individuals' prior beliefs, causes them to update: (1) their perceptions of the certainty of arrest; (2) their ambiguity about arrest risk; and, indirectly, (3) their willingness to commit white-collar crimes.
   The results imply that individuals are willing to incorporate relevant information into their subjective beliefs about sanction risks. Importantly, however, they also make meaningful distinctions about the value of new information for understanding criminal risks.

AB  - Social scientists have long shown great interest in the spatial correlates of crime patterns. A subset of the literature has focused on how micro-level spatial factors influence the formation of crime hot spots. At the same time, tangential research has highlighted how neighbourhood disadvantage influences crime occurrence. The current study focuses on the intersection of these perspectives through a spatial analysis of Motor Vehicle Theft (MVT) and Motor Vehicle Recovery (MVR) in Colorado Springs, CO. We begin by conducting a Risk Terrain Modelling analysis to identify spatial risk factors significantly related to MVT and MVR occurrence. We then test whether the spatial influences of the criminogenic risk factors differ across traditional measures of neighbourhood disadvantage. Findings suggest that while a citywide effect is evident for multiple risk factors, their spatial influence on crime significantly varies across neighbourhood contexts.

AB  - Purpose: Investigate the changes in the spatial patterns of auto theft in Vancouver, British Columbia during a time of a significant crime drop.
   Methods: Geo-referenced auto theft data, 2003 and 2013, is analyzed considering crime concentrations at the street segment level, kernel density estimation, and a nonparametric spatial point pattern test that identifies the similarity in spatial point patterns.
   Results: Auto theft in Vancouver has dropped significantly, but does not appear to have a stable crime pattern. Specific and limited areas account for the crime drop in auto theft rather than occurring at all places. These places appear to be related to target suitability and, therefore, opportunity.
   Conclusions: The crime drop for auto theft in Vancouver has occurred in particular places. This provides support for the implementation of situational prevention efforts. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Given the spatial nature of offender and target behavior, what do standard ecological studies of crime aggregating measures to different geographic units actually tell us?
   Methods: This study used a simple stylized simulation model of crime patterns based on offenders, an exponential distance decay function based on Euclidean distance to capture their typical mobility patterns when committing offenses, and immobile targets.
   Results: There were four key results. First, although a measure of targets can explain much of the variance in micro-level models, knowing where offenders live, and their typical distances traveled to offending, greatly improved the model performance. Second, accounting for the typical spatial movement of offenders before aggregating to larger units produces better results based on explanatory power. Third, the explanatory power of targets alone was much weaker when aggregating to larger units despite the fact that the simulated model of crime events was entirely based on micro processes, highlighting that variance explained is distinct from causal processes. Fourth, knowing how offenders behave in target-rich versus target-poor environment impacts the results considerably.
   Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the consequences of a spatially explicit model of offender and target behavior for ecological studies of crime that aggregate measures to geographic units that are either at the micro-, meso-, or macro-level.

AB  - This study seeks evidence that a newly introduced light rail system has altered the crime opportunity structure in a north-eastern United States city. New public transport systems may affect crime opportunities in their constituent neighborhoods, either by introducing non-local offenders to previously unexplored 'hunting grounds', or by delivering new opportunities to local offenders already active in station neighborhoods. Chi-square analyses of arrest data connected to offenses committed in station areas before and after service introduction found little evidence that the new system had either introduced non-local offenders to its constituent neighborhoods or contributed with new targets to local offenders. These findings are important to transport planners and crime scientists alike, as this evidence may help to both reframe public discourse about potential transport system effects on local crime and aid law enforcement in crafting crime prevention strategies.

The population growth which depending on the immigration in the urban area becomes a reason for individuals' alienation due to become a barrier to reduce creating the strong relationship and to decrease the controllability. Furthermore, the reasons such as the unemployment issue which it is a result of the immigration in the urban area, poverty, shelter issue, getting bigger the gap between social and economic groups to establish the ground to increase of crime and fear of crime. The subject of reducing the crime at urban area, due to correlating with psychology, sociology, criminology and economy fields and also mostly related to urban planning and urban design science's field. In this study, the necessity of safety for creating the quality livable area, the spatial safety measurements which it would be used at spatial design guide and the implementation techniques were mentioned. The goal of this study is creating awareness at the necessity of safety and at the developing the spatial measurements in order to improve safety and to decrease the fear of crime at urban area. In that study, the broken window theory, the defensible space theory, the rational choice theory, the routine activities theory, the crime pattern theory has been studied and each theory's spatial measurement has been compared with each other in order to understand the relation of space and safety.

AB  - The spatial analysis of crime and the current focus on hotspots has pushed the area of crime mapping to the fore, especially in regard to high volume offenses such as vehicle theft and burglary. Hotspots also have a temporal component, yet police recorded crime databases rarely record the actual time of offense as this is seldom known. Police crime data tends, more often than not, to reflect the routine activities of the victims rather than the offense patterns of the offenders. This paper demonstrates a technique that uses police START and END crime times to generate a crime occurrence probability at any given time that can be mapped or visualized graphically. A study in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, demonstrates that crime hotspots with a geographical proximity can have distinctly different temporal patterns.

AB  - Research from environmental criminology, policing, and related literatures consistently finds that objective conditions related to risk of apprehension affect crime. The mechanism underlying this relationship is not explicitly tested; instead, perceptual deterrence is assumed. In this analysis we explicitly investigate that mechanism. This test is not straightforward, however, as some research shows that risk perceptions are susceptible to various cognitive biases and framing effects. Thus, we advance a framework of sanction risk perception that combines individual and contextual determinants. Specifically, we investigate whether contextual factors materially influence risk perceptions and in turn intentions to offend after accounting for the influence of individual-specific determinants. Our data come from an experimental survey on speeding (N = 1,919). Respondents viewed videos from the driver's perspective of a sedan speeding on a highway and provided estimates of sanction risk, safety perceptions, and behavioral intentions. Although sanction risk and safety perceptions for speeding varied widely across respondents, they remained grounded in the objective conditions of the experimental videos. In turn, citizen perceptions of apprehension risk were comparable with risk estimates elicited from state troopers after viewing the same videos. The results suggest deterrence and safety considerations are important contributing factors that help shape intentions to transgress.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore spatiotemporal factors that affect the empirical analysis of whether crime rates in buffer areas surrounding abandoned properties transferred to a Land Bank that differed among three regimes: before transfer, during Land Bank stewardship and after disposition and whether those differences were associated with differences in relative crime activity in the neighborhoods in which they were located. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed crime incidents occurring between 2010 and 2018 in 0.1-mile buffer areas surrounding 31 abandoned properties sold by the Land Bank and their neighborhoods in which those properties were located. Using Copulas, researchers compared concordance/discordance in the buffer areas across the three regime states for each property and approximately matched time periods for associated neighborhoods. Findings In a substantial number of cases, the relative crime activity levels for buffer areas surrounding individual sold properties as measured by the Copulas shifted from concordant to discordant states and vice versa. Similarly, relative crime activity levels for neighborhoods shifted from concordant to discordant states across three matched regimes. In some cases, the property and neighborhood states matched, while in other cases they diverged. These cross-level interactions indicate that criminal behavioral patterns and target selection change over time and relative criminal activity. The introduction of Copulas can improve the reliability of such models over time and when and where they should be customized to add more granular insights needed by law enforcement agencies. Research limitations/implications The introduction of Copulas can improve the spatiotemporal reliability of the analysis of criminal activity over space and time. Practical implications Spatiotemporal considerations should be incorporated in setting interventions to manage criminal activity. Social implications This study provides support for policies supporting renovation of abandoned properties. Originality/value To the best of authors' knowledge, this research is the first application of Copulas to crime impact studies. As noted, Copulas can help reduce the risk of applying intervention or enforcement programs that are no longer reliable or lack the precision provided by insights into convergent/divergent patterns of criminal activity.

AB  - Poaching redwood burls is a problem for Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP), in Northern California, USA. Poachers use chainsaws to remove and they sell them at local burl shops. Consequently, targeted trees are left susceptible to disease and can die. Given the limited resources RNSP have at their disposal, the study reports an empirically driven resource allocation strategy. The study first explores the spatial distribution of poaching incidents and other potentially important drivers of poaching in RNSP before employing an econometric approach informed by crime pattern theory to better understand how features of the natural and built environment within RNSP explain burl poaching. An exact logistic model suggests areas that include a greater number of targets (i.e. redwood burls) that are accessible to roads, as well as areas that are near to a greater number of burl shops are at an increased risk of burl poaching. The odds-ratios for each respective variable in the model are utilized to highlight those areas at greatest risk, and in turn to provide practical guidance for more spatially focused ranger patrols and interventions. A comprehensive intervention strategy that works on multiple levels to reduce opportunities for burl poaching in RNSP is discussed.

AB  - The research objectives were to examine the concentration of crime and its temporal patterns in Nis and compare the related research results in spatial criminology. Longitudinal property and violent crime data were geocoded and assigned to three types of grid cells. Descriptive statistics were used to examine crime concentration, and spatial stability of crime was tested using a spatial point pattern test. The findings suggest an intense concentration of all crime types within all areal units and years of study. The higher rates of concentration were found in the analysis of less common robbery and violent crime. Findings of spatial pattern analysis suggest moderate to a high degree of similarity in spatial patterns among all crime types. However, sensitivity analysis indicates significant changes in the spatial distribution of both property and violent crime. Therefore, an alternative method is applied. Theoretical implications are discussed, highlighting routine activities and crime pattern theory. The study aims to instigate more spatial analysis of crime and evidence-based criminal policies within the region.

AB  - Environmental criminological research includes several perspectives that explain how characteristics of the environment can lead to crime. This study simultaneously integrated these different perspectives, including crime generators and attractors and environmental disorder indicators, to determine the most influential, salient, and consistent predictors of micro-level crime hot spots in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hot spot and control units were compared based on the presence of spatially joined crime generators and attractors and environmental disorder indicators recorded via remote systematic social observation using Google Street View. The results indicate that crime generators and attractors tend to vary in significance, influence, saliency, and consistency across crime types. Alternatively, the presence of decay in hot spots may be the most prominent and stable environmental feature. Environmental criminology has placed an increased focus on crime generators and attractors, though, it may be time to assess the theoretical and practical importance of other criminogenic environmental elements like decay.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense ? Do they rob close to home ? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets ? What keeps them away from certain areas ? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders.

AB  - The study presented here deals with two aspects of the validity of a factorial survey approach (Rossi & Anderson, 1982). This technique is applied to the analysis of crime in everyday life from the perspective of a rational choice approach (Cornish & Clarke, 1986). The situation of "lost letters'' (Milgram, Mann, & Harter, 1965) is regarded as an opportunity to display criminal behaviors within the routine activities of everyday life. The study features this situation and focuses on situational influences upon keeping "lost'' letters. According to the theoretical framework, the effort and the utility of keeping a "lost'' letter are manipulated on the basis of a 2 x 3 design. The study aims at a systematic analysis of the empirical validity and the construct validity of the factorial survey approach. It compares data from a factorial survey (n = 881) with data from a field experiment (n = 395) using an equal study design. The results of the study reveal restrictions of the empirical validity of the factorial survey. Influences of the utility of a "lost'' letter are equal across the factorial survey and the field experiment and support the idea of construct validity. In addition to these influences, differences between data collection methods occur which indicate a susceptibility to social desirable responses in a lost letter framework. This result is discussed with regard to the underlying research questions and methodological implications.

AB  - Purpose: This research fulfills a void in offender mobility discourse. Metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure, defined in crime pattern theory as the urban backcloth, plays a significant role in shaping travel behavior; and yet, current analysis of offender mobility continues to favor individual characteristics to account for travel range.
   Methods: Using a large sample of juveniles, both delinquent and at-risk youth (N=2,552), this study compared the predictive utility of individual characteristics against indicators of urban backcloth.
   Results: Delinquent youth were found to be more sensitive to the environmental conditions exerted by community-level socioeconomic characteristics than their at-risk counterparts. However, two factors-intercity hierarchical structure and motor vehicle access-accounted for travel variability among all youth.
   Conclusions: Offending behavior must be examined within the context of a dynamic environmental context formed by the metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure. Delinquents constitute an identifiable subgroup of youth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The robbery is one of the main crimes in Mexico City. The policies implemented by the police bodies are focalized in reactive actions and few had been made from a prevention perspective. The theoretical background is provided by the routine activities and crime patterns. To measure the relationship a multiple regression model was test. The data include criminal warrants of robbery (PGJDF, 2010) and other socioeconomic variables (INEGI, 2010), both at census tract level. The methodology used is a Geographic Weighted Regression (GwR). The results of the spatial regression model show that commerce and service land use, public transportation stations and the percentage of male population of 18 to 24 years old increase significantly the opportunities to commit a robbery. The results provide some guiding for the design of security public policies focused on the prevention of the criminal activity.

AB  - The crime and place literature has consistently emphasized the importance of understanding spatial patterns of crime using increasingly smaller spatial units of analysis. Despite a growing number of studies using this perspective, very few have investigated sexual offences specifically. The current study uses police event data to investigate the spatial distribution of sexual offences from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, in the city of Austin, Texas (N=1381). After disaggregating offences, first by victim age (child versus adult) and then by type of sexual act (penetration, sexual contact, and sexual non-contact), three measures of spatial clustering, kernel density analyses, and a spatial point pattern test were used. Findings indicate that sexual offences perpetrated against children and adults were spatially concentrated but the degree to which they clustered depended on the type of sexual act committed. Spatial point pattern findings suggest that the street segments (and intersections) affected by sexual crime differed according to the nature of the sexual act committed. Implications for situational crime prevention and policing are discussed.

AB  - This volume's contention that regulations have a powerful role in crime control contradicts the prevailing positivism of criminologythat is, the contention that criminality is largely explained by criminals' past experiences. This article draws upon recent critiques of positivism and explains the implications for contemporary criminology. It begins by describing the ideas of a London magistrate, Patrick Colquhoun, about the determinants of crime and the best means of its control. Colquhoun's writings were the first developed discussion of regulating crime, but they were soon eclipsed by positivist thinking. I list numerous weakness of positivism and argue that, instead of seeing offenders' behavior as determined by their past, greater account should be taken of the situational inducements and opportunities to commit crime that they encounter in their everyday lives. Instead of positivism, the dominant model of criminology and crime control should be a neoclassicist, bounded rational choice model, which would introduce situational design and management changes to restrict offenders choices and modify behavior. That change in orientation would open limitless opportunities for criminologists.

AB  - Deterrence theory has been a centerpiece of theoretical and empirical research in criminology. Largely due to the early work of Beccaria however, much of this research has focused on estimating the effect of the certainty of punishment, or the costs of crime, on criminal offending. Although the benefits/rewards of crime are as important as the costs, conceptualization and operationalization of this portion of the decision-making process has only recently accumulated. In an effort to provide a counterpart to the summary statements available regarding the costs of crime, this paper undertakes a statistical summary of the empirical studies that have examined the benefits/offending relationship, with specific attention paid not only to the overall relationship, but also to several key moderators. Using 40 specific estimates from 13 studies since 1990, the analysis provides evidence of a positive and significant relationship between benefits and offending, but that the overall relationship varies in several ways. Directions for future research are outlined. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scholars generally agree that offending decisions occur in social context, with some suggesting that choice models should explicitly integrate the notion that the deviant actions of others can incentivize offending. In this study, we investigate whether group settings can also disincentivize deviant action via reverse bandwagon effects, where individuals reverse their offending decision and express an intention to opt out of the criminal act. Based on survey data from three universities using hypothetical scenarios about theft and fighting, we find evidence of opt-out thresholds. Our findings indicate that deviant groups can serve as both an incentive and a disincentive, and that the relationship between group size and the perceived utility of crime is more complicated than prior work has suggested. Moreover, we find that these self-reported opt-out thresholds vary across scenarios, indicating that socially interdependent decision-making processes may be situation specific. In the end, the study underscores the importance of acknowledging the social context in offending decisions and highlights that group effects may be more complex and nuanced than previously discussed.

AB  - A common assumption underlying the current public discourse and legal treatment of unauthorized immigrants is that unauthorized immigrants are lawless individuals who will break the law any law in search of economic gain. This notion persists despite substantial empirical evidence to the contrary. Drawing on original empirical data, this Article examines unauthorized immigrants and their relationship to the law from a novel perspective to make two major contributions. First, I demonstrate that unauthorized immigrants view themselves and their noncompliance with U.S. immigration law in a manner that is strikingly different from the prevalent view of criminality and lawlessness found in popular and legal accounts. Unauthorized immigrants' decisions to cross the border and to remain in the United States despite their lack of legal status are likely shaped in large measure by their distinct normative views of themselves and their economic situations, as well as their perceptions about the lack of legitimacy of U.S. immigration law. Second, I show why understanding these views and values of unauthorized immigrants may have significant implications for promoting voluntary compliance with U.S. immigration law.

AB  - White-collar crime and illegal political extremism share several characteristics with relevance to criminology. Neither is associated with lower socioeconomic status individuals, both involve perpetrators that rarely see themselves as criminal, and both face unique data challenges. Following Edwin Sutherland's influential research, the study of white-collar crime became a recognized specialization within criminology. Similarly, following the coordinated attacks of September 11, 2001, political extremism became increasingly accepted as a legitimate research topic in criminology. I explore several ways that the study of terrorism has influenced criminological research and how responses to terrorist attacks since 9/11 can help us understand policing. Terrorism research has vividly illustrated the socially constructed nature of crime, has encouraged researchers to see not only the deterrence potential of punishment but also its capacity to produce backlash, has accelerated cross-national criminology research, and has hastened the embrace of open sources as an important form of criminal justice data. Changes in policing following 9/11 and the resulting war on terror also provide critical insights into the extent to which policing depends on community trust and legitimacy. As with the embrace of white-collar crime nearly a century ago, mainstream criminology has been enriched by widening its scope to include political extremism.

AB  - Objectives: Use crime pattern theory to investigate the proximity effects of public housing communities on robbery crime while taking into account the presence of nearby nonresidential facilities. Method: The study uses data describing 41 Philadelphia public housing communities and their surrounds. Surrounds are defined using two increments of street block-sized buffers. Multilevel models (buffer areas nested around public housing communities) allowing the proximity effect to vary across communities and predicting its shape with public housing level predictors are estimated. Results: The multilevel models show that the shape of proximity effects varies across public housing communities and depends on community size, even after factoring in presence of nonresidential facilities. Spatially, multiple public housing communities close to one another have more intense robbery patterns. Conclusions: Labeling all public housing communities as equally criminogenic robbery exporters is unwarranted. In fact, some communities have lower robbery counts than the areas surrounding them. Consequently, effectively addressing robbery in and around public housing communities will require careful consideration of where the problem is located. Locating public housing communities more than two blocks apart may reduce robbery.

AB  - A number of studies have revealed a correlation between bus stops and crimes, especially street robberies. However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement.

AB  - Deterrence describes a process in which perceived risks and rewards influence offending decisions, whereas deterrability refers to the capacity or inclination to engage in this process. There are alternative forms of undeterrability. Incorrigible individuals offend regardless of how high the potential legal costs are and acute conformists refrain from crime regardless of how low the potential legal costs are. Using data from a nationwide survey of Americans (n = 955), the current study distinguishes two manifestations of morality hypothesized to underlie acute conformity. Results suggest that people's moral identity, which reflects their degree of commitment to ethical and prosocial ideals, informs their specific moral attitudes, or appraisals of the wrongfulness of particular behaviors. These constructs operate in tandem to produce acute conformity. Additionally, moral attitudes are found to vary by behavior resulting in within person heterogeneity in the acute conformity characterization. We discuss our findings as it relates to theoretical advancement of deterrability and policy that promotes conformity.

AB  - This study examined street robbery patterns in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from the years 2009 to 2011 to determine whether the effects of potentially criminogenic places are different across different periods of the day. Census block (N = 13,164) street robbery counts across four periods (6:45 a.m. to 9:59 a.m., 10:00 a.m. to 4:29 p.m., 4:30 p.m. to 9:14 p.m., and 9:15 p.m. to 6:44 a.m.) were modeled with 12 different potentially criminogenic places, 3 measures of illicit markets, 4 compositional control variables, and spatially lagged versions of the 12 potentially criminogenic places and population using simultaneously estimated negative binomial regression models. Differences in the magnitudes of the parameter estimates across the time periods were assessed with Wald tests. Overall, the patterns across the four models were mostly consistent with the effects hypothesized based on the study's crime pattern theory and time-geography theoretical frame; yet differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients were less pronounced than hypothesized. Overall, the results provide moderate support for the crime pattern theory and time-geography explanation of spatial-temporal robbery patterns; however, numerous points are raised for future crime and place research.

AB  - Objectives. This paper explores how offenders manage the prospect of victim confrontation during auto theft. Methods. Data were drawn from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 35 active offenders recruited from the streets of a large Midwestern US city using snowball sampling methods. Results. Two contextual domains figured prominently in the offenders' decision-making calculus: The area around the target and the target itself. The first galvanized the offenders' attention to, and management of, informal social control. The second enjoined offenders to balance speed and stealth in breaching the target. Conclusions. Victim confrontation is an informal sanction that is distinct from both retaliation and traditional extralegal sanctions. The rarity with which it occurs in auto theft is likely due to confrontation avoidance measures offenders adopt at the front end of the offense and during the enactment process itself. The conceptual implications of victim confrontation in crime are explored in relation to the following five areas: (1) sanction celerity and present orientation; (2) sanction certainty and ambiguity aversion; (3) sanction interdependence; (4) violence avoidance; and (5) directions for future research.

AB  - The distinct peer-based perspectives of deviant normative influence and unstructured/unsupervised socializing with friends contend that adolescents rely on different information when deciding to offend, with the former positing that individuals offend after considering the longer term consequences of behavior, and the latter positing that decisions to offend derive from situational stimuli. We argue that these processes can be organized under a dual-systems framework of decision making, which leads to the hypothesis that individuals at the edges of impulsivity should be differentially vulnerable to these peer influence processes because of their tendency to rely on only one system of decision making. We use two large data sets to test this hypothesis: a nationally representative sample of adolescents from the AddHealth study (N= approximate to 9,000) and a pooled panel data set of adolescents from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) evaluation (N= 1,172). The results of longitudinal negative binomial analyses indicate that normative influence by deviant peers has a stronger effect on delinquency for adolescents with low impulsivity than it does for individuals with high impulsivity. Differences in the informal socializing with peers coefficients are less clear and offer minimal support for our predictions.

AB  - The legalization of medical marijuana remains a controversial policy. An important dimension of marijuana legalization is the siting of dispensaries and their influence on a surrounding community. Specifically, dispensaries, if they engender criminogenic opportunities via changes in routine activities, have the potential to increase crimes in the areas surrounding medicinal marijuana dispensaries (MMDs). Using a quasi-experimental design, we examine the relationship between MMDs and crime using micro-spatial units in a novel location. Street level geocoded crime data for violent and nonviolent crime patterns before and after the opening of MMD's in Washington, D.C. Crime is analyzed with 100 m buffers around each dispensary and control location drawn from propensity score matching. Differences between crime rates pre- and postoperation are compared. With the exception of one location, crime decreased or remained constant in geographical areas following the opening of a dispensary. MMDs do not appear to have an immediate criminogenic effect. Implications for future research regarding potential confounding factors and data limitations are discussed.

TI  - Spatial forecast methods for terrorist events in urban environments
T2  - INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 2nd Symposium on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI 2004)
AB  - Terrorist events such as suicide bombings are rare yet extremely destructive events. Responses to such events are even rarer, because they require forecasting methods for effective prevention and early detection. While many forecasting methods are available, few are designed for conflict scenarios. This paper builds on previous work in forecasting criminal behavior using spatial choice models. Specifically we describe the fusion of two techniques for modeling the spatial choice of suicide bombers into a unified forecast that combines spatial likelihood modeling of environmental characteristics with logistic regression modeling of demographic features. In addition to describing the approach we also provide motivation for the fusion of the methods and contrast the results obtained with those from the more common kernel density estimation methods that do not account for variation in the event space. We give an example of successful use of this combined method and an evaluation of its performance. We conclude that the fusion method shows improvement over other methods and greater scalability for combining larger numbers of spatial forecasting methods than were previously available.

AB  - Researchers commonly use hypothetical intentions to offend as proxies for real-world offending behavior. The current study examined the predictive validity of these hypothetical intentions, as well as the consequences of using offending intentions in statistical models of decision-making. Undergraduate students were asked to self-report their intentions to cheat on a hypothetical online exam for which they were unprepared. Minutes later, they completed a difficult online trivia test for course credit. Students who performed well on the trivia test were presumed to have cheated. Hypothetical intentions to cheat were found to predict actual cheating at a rate no better than chance. Furthermore, while several factors were found to be predictive of hypothetical cheating, none were predictive of actual cheating. This incongruence between intentions and behavior may be attributed to the different emotional reactions evoked by hypothetical and real-world offending opportunities. Implications for research on offender decision-making are discussed.

AB  - The economics literature generally supports a positive theoretical link between income inequality and crime. However, despite this consensus, empirical evidence has struggled to yield definitive conclusions. To address this puzzle, I conducted a meta -analysis based on 1,341 estimates drawn from 43 studies in economics journals. The findings indicate a statistically significant but economically insignificant true effect of inequality on crime, ranging between 0.007 and 0.123 using UWLS FAT -PET and advanced methods. In essence, if there is an impact of inequality on crime, it is, at best, minimal. Additionally, there is some limited evidence suggesting positive publication bias. Results from Bayesian model averaging reveal that inequality does not affect exclusively property crime, as predicted by the rational choice models. Moreover, this analysis shows that inequality measures which are sensitive to changes in income at the middle and top of the distribution are associated with higher coefficients. The study also underscores the biases arising from the exclusion of relevant variables. The implications of this research suggest that inequality may not be the primary motivator for criminal behaviour, with other factors potentially playing more significant roles. Lastly, if inequality does affect crime, it might do so in different ways than those discussed by the majority of the existing empirical studies.

AB  - This study proposes a novel contextualized colocation analysis to examine spatial crime patterns within their social contexts. The sample includes all reported MCI crime incidents (i.e., assault, break and enter, robbery, auto theft, and theft over incidents) in the city of Toronto between 2014 and 2019 (n = 178,892). Following a stepwise clustering feature selection, we begin our analysis by regionalizing the city based on the relevant social context indicators through a ward-like hierarchical spatial clustering algorithm. Then, we use a modified colocation miner algorithm with a novel Validity Score (VS) to select significant citywide and regional crime colocation patterns. The results indicate that eating establishments, commercial parking lots, and retail food stores are the most frequent urban facilities in citywide and regional crime colocation patterns. We also note several peculiar crime colocation patterns across disadvantaged neighborhoods. Additionally, the proposed analysis selects the patterns that explain an average of 11% more crime events through the use of VS. Our study offers an alternative method for colocation analysis by effectively identifying crime-specific citywide and regional crime colocation patterns. It also prioritizes the identified colocation patterns by ranking them based on their significance.

AB  - Purpose: Using both crime pattern and social disorganization theories, the current study investigates the characteristics of those places that experience high counts of reported sexual crime to police.
   Methods: Socio-demographic factors, land use, specific sexual crime attractors, and ecological variables are used to predict dissemination areas with high counts of sexual crime within a large city using 2180 founded crime events retrieved from a Canadian police database.
   Results: Socio-demographic and ecological factors, as well as the presence of particular sexual crime attractors, characterize these neighborhoods. For example, dissemination areas that have higher percentages of female, male, and single residents, as well as higher counts of rental units, bars, and schools, experience more sexual crimes. Land use does not predict dissemination areas with high counts of sexual crime.
   Conclusions: Both crime pattern and social disorganization theories provide a framework within which the nature of sexual crime places can be better understood. This information could be used to empower community members as to the types of places that are the riskiest for crimes of this nature, as well as to create a conversation about interventions that could be put in place at both the secondary and tertiary levels to prevent future occurrences.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the interplay of perceived deterrence and level of self-control in explaining individual differences in self-reported offending. Different theories of crime come to different conclusions in this regard. Some postulate independent negative effects of perceived sanction risk on offending (Deterrence Theory), while others assume that low self-control undermines the deterrent effect of legal sanctions (Self-Control Theory) or, conversely, that sanction threats are only relevant for individuals characterized by a lack of self-control (Situational Action Theory). Here, the question of the exact nature of this interplay is addressed from an empirical point of view. Based on three independent surveys of adolescents conducted in three European countries (Austria, Belgium and Slovenia), we examine whether juveniles with low self-control are more, equally or less susceptible to the deterrent effect of legal sanctioning. Our findings consistently support Situational Action Theorys conceptualization of the linkage between self-control and deterrence. All three studies provide evidence that deterrent effects are greatest among adolescents of low self-control.

AB  - Social and behavioral research on terrorism has expanded dramatically. However, theoretical work that incorporates terrorism and collection of valid data on it has lagged behind theoretical work on other criminological subjects. Theorizing has been dominated by deterrence perspectives. Threats of severe consequence for terrorist acts in general show little promise, but there is evidence that increasing the certainty of consequences works in some situations. Research on terrorism will be improved if it moves beyond deterrence to include concepts drawn from legitimacy, strain, and situational perspectives. Limitations of traditional criminology data sources for studying terrorism have encouraged the development of open-source-event databases. The most comprehensive, created by combining the Global Terrorism Database with RAND-MIPT data, documents more than 77,000 terrorist incidents from 1970 to 2006. Attacks peaked in the early 1990s and then declined substantially until 9/11. They have since substantially increased. The regional concentration of terrorism has moved from Western Europe in the 1970s, to Latin America in the 1980s, to the Middle East and Persian Gulf in the twenty-first century. Despite the enormous resources devoted to countering terrorism, surprisingly little empirical information is available on which strategies are most effective.

AB  - Objective:
   Examine the place-based correlates of robbery activity displaced by a foot-patrol intervention in Newark, NJ. We use constructs from Crime Pattern and Social Disorganization theories to test hypotheses concerned with associations between the structure of the environment and the displacement of crime.
   Method:
   Robbery incidents were spatially joined to street segments to study micro-level displacement processes. Predictor variables were operationalized using data from the Newark Police Department and Infogroup USA. Generalized Linear models tested associations between the characteristics of street segments and displaced robbery in the target area as compared to a control.
   Results:
   Environmental structure is important to understanding the settings of displacement, though this varied between spatial and temporal displacement. Relationships between displaced crime activity and model covariates did not always appear in expected directions. For example, bus stops predicted increased spatial displacement while corner stores predicted decreased levels of temporal displacement.
   Conclusions:
   While testing for displacement has become commonplace in place-based policing interventions, less attention has been paid to the micro-level factors that may facilitate the displacement of crime events. Both bus stops and corner stores show consistent associations with displaced crime activity, but the directions of these relationships suggest more complex processes requiring further examination.

AB  - The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public.

AB  - This research analyzes the association between alcohol outlets and reported violent crime at the small-area level in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Alcohol outlets are hypothesized to be associated with high violent crime, primarily because they bring together large numbers of potential offenders and targets, and from a policy perspective, alcohol outlets are a modifiable land use risk factor that can be addressed through land use planning and policy. Results show that both on- and off-premise alcohol outlets are positively associated with reported violent crime after accounting for socioeconomic characteristics. Using small-area risk estimates resulting from Bayesian spatial regression models, map decomposition visualizes the geographic pattern of violent crime risk and the contribution of specific risk factors at the small-area scale, and violent crime hotspots are identified based on posterior probability of relative risk. Applying results to land use planning and policy, we identify small-areas that may be preferred for proposed alcohol outlets based on specific criteria such as low violent crime risk and low risk due to alcohol outlets. We also discuss how the results of this research inform law enforcement initiatives.

AB  - The interplay of sanctions, perceptions, and crime has special significance in criminology and is central to a long tradition of perceptual deterrence research as well as to more recent scholarship on crime decision-making. This article seeks to review this body of research as it pertains to three basic questions. First, are people's perceptions of punishment accurate? The evidence indicates that people are generally but imperfectly aware of punishments allowed under the law but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in enforcement, especially of behaviors that are personally relevant. Second, does potential apprehension affect people's perceived risk and behavior when faced with a criminal opportunity? A highly varied body of literature supports the conclusion that perceptions are sensitive to situational cues and that behavior is sensitive to perceived risk, but these links can be weakened when individuals are in emotionally or socially charged situations. Third, do people revise their risk perceptions in response to crime and punishment experiences? Studies of perceptual change support the contention that people systematically update their perceptions based on their own and others' experiences with crime and punishment.

AB  - The present study examined if Weisburd's (Criminology 53(2):133-157, 2015) law of crime concentration held across different theoretically relevant temporal scales.
   The cumulative percentages of Philadelphia, PA USA street blocks and intersections experiencing 25 and 50 % of street robberies by hour of the day, days of the week, and seasons of the year were compared to the bandwidth percentages established by Weisburd (2015). Different analyses were used to determine the stability of the micro-places' street robbery levels within the three temporal scales.
   We found that the cumulative percentages of street blocks and intersections experiencing 25 and 50 % of street robberies at each of the three temporal scales closely matched the bandwidth percentages expected from Weisburd (2015) and some micro-places experienced street robberies across all temporal periods while others had more isolated temporal concentrations.
   Weisburd's (2015) law of crime concentration holds across different theoretically relevant temporal scales, and future criminology of place studies should not ignore temporal crime patterns. Further, it may be possible to refine hot spots policing approaches by incorporating spatial-temporal crime concentrations.

AB  - The majority of differential deterrability research has investigated whether people differ in the extent to which a perceived threat of sanctions deters them from committing a crime. Less is known about the differential influence of criminal justice intervention on sanction threat perceptions. According to deterrence theory, however, for justice intervention to successfully deter crime, a process of perceptual updating is required. In the current study, we used panel data from German adolescents to supplement the research on differential updating. We applied fixed effects regressions to analyze whether people with weaker or stronger morals update their perceptions of detection risk differently following experiences of police detection. Our findings suggest that they do: risk perceptions increased more in adolescents with weak morals than in adolescents with strong morals when they experienced a higher certainty of detection (a higher detection rate). Combined with previous findings on differential deterrence (by personal morality), our results indicate that deterrence processes may-for individuals with weak morals-play a more critical role in the prevention of crime than previous nondifferential research has suggested.

AB  - Objectives: Abandoned houses may attract or generate crime; however, little is known about the nature of this relationship. Our study is aimed at better understanding this link. Methods: Focusing on a high-crime neighborhood in Ohio, we use spatial video and calls for service (CFS) to examine how crime changed on streets where abandoned homes were removed. We also draw on the insights of 35 ex-offenders, police officers, and residents to examine how and why abandoned houses are connected to crime in this locale. Results: On average, streets where abandoned houses were razed accounted for a lower proportion of neighborhood crime after removal. Also, a lower proportion of total CFS from these streets related to serious crime. Our narrative data indicate that abandoned houses are opportunistic because they provide cover, unoccupied spaces, and are easy targets. Conclusions: The removal of abandoned housing was associated with positive changes in crime overall; however, our approach revealed interesting variation across streets. We surmise that the relevance of a particular abandoned house may be contingent on the larger context of that street or neighborhood. In order to understand these dynamics, future research should continue to "drill down" into micro-spaces.

AB  - I propose a general theory for examining the spatial distribution of crime by specifically addressing and estimating the spatial distribution of the residences of offenders, targets, guardians, and their respective expected movement patterns across space and time. The model combines information on the locations of persons, typical spatial movement patterns, and situational characteristics of locations to create estimates of crime potential at various locations at various points in time and makes four key contributions. First, the equations make the ideas involved in the theory explicit, and they highlight points at which our current state of empirical evidence is lacking. Second, by creating measures of spatial "potentials" of offenders, targets, and guardians, this theory provides a precise grounding for operationalizing spatial effects in studies of place and crime. Third, the equations provide an explicit consideration of offenders and where they might travel and, therefore, incorporates offenders into crime-and-place research. Fourth, these equations suggest ways that researchers could use simulations to predict stable patterns, as well as changes, in the levels of crime at both micro and macro scales. Finally, I provide an empirical demonstration of the added explanatory power provided by the theory to a study of place and crime.

AB  - Spatial crime simulations contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive crime and can support decision-makers in developing effective crime reduction strategies. Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction.

Methods Using crime incident data gathered from six U.S. municipal police departments (Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and Seattle) and aggregated to the street segment, Local Moran's I is calculated to identify statistically significant high and low crime clusters across each city and outliers within those clusters that differ significantly from their local spatial neighbors. Results Within cities, the proportion of segments that are like their neighbors and fall within a statistically significant high or low crime cluster are relatively stable over time. For all cities, the largest proportion of street segments fell into the same classification over time (47.5% to 69.3%); changing segments were less common (4.7% to 20.5%). Changing clusters (i.e., segments that fell into both low and high clusters during the study) were rare. Outliers in each city reveal statistically significant street-to-street variability. Conclusions The findings revealed similarities across cities, including considerable stability over time in segment classification. There were also cross-city differences that warrant further investigation, such as varying levels of spatial clustering. Understanding stable and changing clusters and outliers offers an opportunity for future research to explore the mechanisms that shape a city's spatiotemporal crime patterns to inform strategic resource allocation at smaller spatial scales.

AB  - This research-perspective article reviews and contributes to the literature that explains how to deter internal computer abuse (ICA), which is criminal computer behavior committed by organizational insiders. ICA accounts for a large portion of insider trading, fraud, embezzlement, the selling of trade secrets, customer privacy violations, and other criminal behaviors, all of which are highly damaging to organizations. Although ICA represents a momentous threat for organizations, and despite numerous calls to examine this behavior, the academic response has thus far been lukewarm. However, a few security researchers have examined ICA's influence in an organizational context and addressed potential means of deterring it. However, the results of these studies have been mixed, leading to a debate on the applicability of deterrence theory (DT) to ICA. We argue that more compelling opportunities will arise in DT research if security researchers more deeply study its assumptions and more carefully recontextualize it. The purpose of this article is to advance a deterrence research agenda that is grounded in the pivotal criminological deterrence literature. Drawing on the distinction between absolute and restrictive deterrence and aligning them with rational choice theory (RCT), this paper shows how deterrence can be used to mitigate the participation in and frequency of ICA. We thus propose that future research on the deterrent effects of ICA should be anchored in a more general RCT, rather than in examinations of deterrence as an isolated construct. We then explain how adopting RCT with DT opens up new avenues of research. Consequently, we propose three areas for future research, which cover not only the implications for the study of ICA deterrence, but also the potential motivations for these types of offenses and the skills required to undertake them.

AB  - Background: Cryptomarkets represent an important drug market innovation by bringing buyers and sellers of illegal drugs together in a 'hidden' yet public online marketplace. We ask: How do cryptomarket drug sellers and buyers perceive the risks of detection and arrest, and attempt to limit them?
   Methods: We analyse selected texts produced by vendors operating on the first major drug cryptomarket, Silk Road (N = 600) alongside data extracted from the marketplace discussion forum that include buyer perspectives. We apply Fader's (2016) framework for understanding how drug dealers operating 'offline' attempt to reduce the risk of detection and arrest: visibility reduction, charge reduction and risk distribution.
   Results: We characterize drug transactions on cryptomarkets as 'stretched' across time, virtual and physical space, and handlers, changing the location and nature of risks faced by cryptomarket users. The key locations of risk of detection and arrest by law enforcement were found in 'offline' activities of cryptomarket vendors (packaging and delivery drop-offs) and buyers (receiving deliveries). Strategies in response involved either creating or disrupting routine activities in line with a non-offending identity. Use of encrypted communication was seen as 'good practice' but often not employed. 'Drop shipping' allowed some Silk Road vendors to sell illegal drugs without the necessity of handling them.
   Conclusion: Silk Road participants neither viewed themselves as immune to, nor passively accepting of, the risk of detection and arrest. Rational choice theorists have viewed offending decisions as constrained by limited access to relevant information. Cryptomarkets as 'illicit capital' sharing communities provide expanded and low-cost access to information enabling drug market participants to make more accurate assessments of the risk of apprehension. The abundance of drug market intelligence available to those on both sides of the law may function to speed up innovation in illegal drug markets, as well as necessitate and facilitate the development of law enforcement responses.

AB  - Objectives: While terrorism studies were once castigated as atheoretical and unempirical, criminology has been well suited to apply theories of crime to terrorism and to then test those theories with rigorous methods and robust data. The present study takes stock of how criminologists have theorized about terrorism and tested those theories over time in 13 of the discipline's leading journals. Methods: The study systematically examines theoretical framing, hypotheses, methodological approach, focus within criminology and criminal justice, and policy recommendations in terrorism-focused articles. Results: While terrorism has become more central within top journals, sparse attention has been paid to many criminological theories that could help us understand terrorism. Additional qualitative, theoretical, and mixed-methods research is needed. Further, few articles address the making of terrorism laws. We identify other systematic strengths and weaknesses across the literature and highlight domains for future research. Conclusions: Criminological research on terrorism has engaged theories within and beyond the discipline and employed a range of methodologies with diverse data sources to make contributions to both our broader field and to the larger body of scholarship on terrorism. Yet, many opportunities exist for criminologists to expand research on the making, breaking, and reaction to break laws regarding terrorism.

AB  - Sao Paulo is the largest city in South America, with crime rates that reflect its size. The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion, revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data. The experiments show the capability of CrimAnalyzer in identifying crime-related phenomena.

AB  - Purpose: The journey to crime is well-researched in criminology. Fundamental to many of these studies is the offending probability by distance function, a distribution comprised of two key components - distance decay and the buffer zone. However, it is difficult to measure this relationship accurately because of intensive data requirements. Here, we explore this challenge in detail and quantify data requirements. Methods: We define and describe the buffer zone and outline two proposed explanations. Using this framework, four critical research considerations that avoid the ecological fallacy are identified, and a testing procedure proposed. Finally, we conduct simulation analyses to establish minimum data requirements. Results: We conclude 50 or more observations are needed to reliably determine the shape of an offender's travel distribution, a number much higher than used in previous studies. Two empirical case studies of prolific predatory offenders support these findings. Conclusion: Understanding crime journeys is relevant for both theory and practice. Crime travel is central to routine activity and crime pattern theories, and a critical factor in offender decision-making, target choice, spatial displacement, crime scripts, geographic profiling, crime prevention, and risk assessments. The relationship between distance and offending probability must be accurately measured to be properly understood.

AB  - Urban crimes are not homogeneously distributed but exhibit spatial heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Meanwhile, while geographic space shapes human activities, it is also closely related to multiscale characteristics. Previous studies have explored the influence of underlying geographic space on crime occurrence from the mechanistic perspective, treating geographic space as a collection of points or lines, neglecting the multiscale nature of the spatial heterogeneity of crime and underlying geographic space. Therefore, inspired by the recent concept of "living structure" in geographic information science, this study applied a multiscale analysis method to explore the association between underlying geographic space and crime distribution. Firstly, the multiscale heterogeneity is described while simultaneously considering both the statistical and geometrical characteristics. Then, the spatial association rule mining approach is adopted to quantitatively measure the association between crime occurrence and geographic space at multiple scales. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated by crime incidents in the city of Philadelphia. Experimental results show that crime heterogeneity is indeed closely related with the spatial scales. It is also proven that the influence of underlying geographic space on crime heterogeneity varies with the spatial scales. This study may enrich the methodology in crime pattern and crime explanation analysis, and it provides useful insights for effective crime prevention.

AB  - The illicit sale of prescription drugs for enhancing cognitive performance is a criminal act which has hardly been studied although the consumption of these drugs by healthy people has numerous negative individual and social consequences. In this study, we scrutinize the decision to sale those drugs based on assumptions of various criminological rational choice models, self-control theory, social norms, as well as the Model of Frame Selection (MFS) and the Situational Action Theory (SAT). Thereby, we also consider interactions between instrumental incentives, self-control and norms. To investigate decisions regarding the illegal sale of performance enhancing drugs, we used a web-based survey among students at four German universities (N=1,698). Each respondent received randomly one out of 900 vignettes, in each case describing a hypothetical sales situation concerning the illegal and financially rewarding transmission of medications to enhance concentration between students. The descriptions have been randomly varied with respect to the sales profits and the severity of punishments and their respective probabilities. Moreover, the degree of self-control and internalized norms regarding illegal sales have been assessed. The results, that are derived from double hurdle models, show that, especially, internalized norms as well as the severity of punishment reduce the willingness of selling, while low self-control and increasing profits increase this willingness. In addition, a negative interaction effect between low self-control and the severity of punishment shows that a more severe punishment leads to more deterrence when self-control is lower (respectively that with more sever punishments, the impact of self-control decreases). Although the results support the theoretical assumptions only partially, we can show that internalized norms significantly influence the perception of criminal behavior while the benefits of such behavior and self-control seem to operate in a downstream deliberation process.

AB  - Objectives To examine the influence of street block slope on robbery in Cincinnati, Ohio. Methods Data visualizations were used to examine how street block slope varies across the city. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the influence of street block slope on robbery net of betweenness, facility composition, and socio-demographics. Results A 1% increase in street block slope was associated with roughly 4.5% fewer street block robberies per foot of street block length. Street blocks with a higher expected usage potential, measured via betweenness, were also observed to have higher expected robbery levels. In addition, numerous facilities and neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics linked to higher robbery levels. Conclusions Steeper street blocks may have fewer robberies because they make the physical costs for committing robberies too high, are too difficult to escape from, and/or provide fewer robbery opportunities due to relatively lower usage. Moreover, more robberies appear to occur on street blocks with higher betweenness due to more potential opportunities there. Finally, the influence of facilities and community characteristics were largely consistent with theoretical expectations and past studies. Future studies should continue to examine how topography influences aggregate crime levels and offender decision making in other settings to bolster the external validity of the present findings.

AB  - The relationship between crime patterns and associated variables has drawn a lot of attention. These variables play a critical role in crime prediction. While traditional regression models are capable of revealing the contribution of the variables, they are not optimal for crime prediction. In contrast, machine learning models are more effective for crime prediction, but most of them cannot estimate the contribution of each individual variable. This study aims to overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the interpretability of advanced machine learning models. Based on the routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, this study selects 17 variables for the crime prediction. The XGBoost algorithm is adopted to train the prediction model. A post-hoc interpretable method, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), is used to discern the contribution of individual variables. A variable with a higher SHAP value has a higher contribution to the crime prediction model. In addition to the global model for the entire area, a local model is calibrated at each study unit, revealing the spatial variation of the variables' unique contributions. Among all 17 variables used in this model, the proportion of the non-local population and the ambient population aged 25-44 contribute more than other variables in predicting crime. The more the ambient population aged 25-44 in the area, the more the public thefts. Additionally, local SHAP values are mapped to demonstrate each variable's contribution to the crime prediction model across the study area. The results of the local models can help the police tackle the most important factors at each location, while the global model identifies the important factors for the entire region.

AB  - Since philosophers Beccaria and Bentham, criminologists have been concerned with predicting how governmental attempts to maintain lawful behavior affect subsequent rates of criminal violence. In this article, we build on prior research to argue that governmental responses to a specific form of criminal violence-terrorism-may produce both a positive deterrence effect (i.e., reducing future incidence of prohibited behavior) and a negative backlash effect (i.e., increasing future incidence of prohibited behavior). Deterrence-based models have long dominated both criminal justice and counterterrorist policies on responding to violence. The models maintain that an individual's prohibited behavior can be altered by the threat and imposition of punishment. Backlash models are more theoretically scattered but receive mixed support from several sources, which include research on counterterrorism; the criminology literature on labeling, legitimacy, and defiance; and the psychological literature on social power and decision making. In this article, we identify six major British strategies aimed at reducing political violence in Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1992 and then use a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the impact of these interventions on the risk of new attacks. In general, we find the strongest support for backlash models. The only support for deterrence models was a military surge called Operation Motorman, which was followed by significant declines in the risk of new attacks. The results underscore the importance of considering the possibility that antiterrorist interventions might both increase and decrease subsequent violence.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of residential burglary is shaped by the configuration of the street network, as predicted by, for example, crime pattern theory. In particular, the study examines whether burglary risk is higher on street segments with higher usage potential.
   Residential burglary data for Birmingham (UK) are examined at the street segment level using a hierarchical linear model. Estimates of the usage of street segments are derived from the graph theoretical metric of betweenness, which measures how frequently segments feature in the shortest paths (those most likely to be used) through the network. Several variants of betweenness are considered. The geometry of street segments is also incorporated-via a measure of their linearity-as are several socio-demographic factors.
   As anticipated by theory, the measure of betweenness was found to be a highly-significant predictor of the burglary victimization count at the street segment level for all but one of the variants considered. The non-significant result was found for the most localized measure of betweenness considered. More linear streets were generally found to be at lower risk of victimization.
   Betweenness offers a more granular and objective means of measuring the street network than categorical classifications previously used, and its meaning links more directly to theory. The results provide support for crime pattern theory, suggesting a higher risk of burglary for streets with more potential usage. The apparent negative effect of linearity suggests the need for further research into the visual component of target choice, and the role of guardianship.

AB  - The current study conducts a spatial-temporal examination of physical environment for walkability and crime in block groups located across nine U.S. cities. We aggregated the crime data for each of the different crime types using the block group where the crime occurred and the 2-hour period of the 24-hour day when the crime occurred. We estimated models at each 2-hour time slot (for weekdays and weekends), separately, to look at the effect of the walkability measure on crime at different hours of the day. Our results show that the crime enhancing effect of physical environment for walkability changes across different hours of the day, and such temporal patterns vary by different types of crime. Crime-enhancing effect of physical environment for walk ability is relatively stronger during very early morning time (midnight-4 am), and the risk of crime as a result of neighborhood walkability peaks in the late afternoon (2-4 or 4-6 pm). The measure of physical environment for walkability has different effect on crime patterns across hours of the day as the usage and meaning of physical environment and routine activities of people visiting the area, and thus the structures of criminal opportunities and guardianship capability temporally vary at different time periods.

AB  - Deterrence studies have shown that perceived sanction risk is related to delinquent behaviour, independent of other variables, and that this relation may be conditioned by individual propensity towards crime. The principal goal of this study is to assess these findings with data from a sample of 843 Dutch adolescents. First, we analysed whether perceived sanction risk (perceived apprehension risk and perceived consequences if one is caught offending) has a relationship with offending, independent of one's morality and self-control. Second, we examined possible interactions between perceived sanction risk and self-control, and between perceived sanction risk and morality. We also explored associations between specific offences (burglary, vandalism and assault), offence-specific measures of low morality (how right or wrong are burglary, vandalism and assault) and specific measures of perceived sanction risks. The findings demonstrate that perceived sanction risk is related to lower offending and that self-control is related to less offending, whereas low levels of morality are related to higher levels of offending. When offence-specific measures are used, the relation between perceived sanctions and offending seems to be dependent on one's level of morality. Our results suggest that the less a person morally supports specific types of offending, the more strongly that person is affected by perceived sanctions. The implications of these findings for future studies of deterrence are discussed.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that climate variability and change impact both violent and property crimes. To investigate the mechanism, time series of crime rates (crime incidents permillion people) and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and haze) are decomposed into three components-long-term trends, seasonality and daily variations (or "noise"). Based on a 12-year dataset of daily crime (robbery, minimal violent robbery (MVR), assault, rape and homicide) numbers in Beijing, China, the correlation between climate variability and crime rate is examined for each component. The results show that in terms of seasonality, strong positive relations are observed for temperature-to-MVR, temperature-to-assault, temperature-to-rape, and relative-humidity-to-MVR but negative relations for haze-to-MVR, haze-to-assault, and haze-to-rape, which can be explained by Routine Activity Theory. In terms of daily variations, temperature, rainfall and haze are key factors. The correlations are all positive for temperature-to-assault, temperature-to-rape, temperature-to-homicide, rainfall-to-MVR, rainfall-to-robbery and rainfall-to-homicide. However, the relations between haze and crimes are more complicated. Specifically, the correlations are negative for haze-to-MVR and haze-torobbery, but positive for haze-to-homicide, which can be interpreted by Crime Pattern Theory and also influenced by offenders' bounded rationality.

AB  - The research of a criminal's movements and the identification of his key locations is a complex task for both criminology and criminalistics. The analysis of publications shows that geographical profiling can be viewed simultaneously as an interdisciplinary field of knowledge, as a method for obtaining orienting diagnostic information about the criminal, and as a process of corresponding analytical activity; besides, the number of geographical profiling objects grows with time: the place of residence is supplemented by other anchor points where the criminal might spend time. The author states that in some cases geographical profiling methods might be effective for identifying the criminal who committed a single crime, and not necessarily a series of crimes. The theoretical foundations of geographical profiling are examined, they include the theory of routine activities, rational choice, crime patters, circle, and also attenuation with an increase of distance. Normative and criminalistic approaches to geoinformation systems are analyzed. The author presents a description of key software complexes that have geographical profiling as their dominant or one of their dominant features, including Rigel, Dragnet, Crimestat, Predator and Gemini. Main drawbacks of these programs are examined: an orientation at a large number of similar crimes, supposed stable composition of a criminal group, a small number of different groups of criminals and a small area of the territory under analysis, region-based linking to databases. It is also possible to use non-core geoinformation services for modelling a criminal's movements, for instance, for determining the direction of pursuit while the trail is still hot or for verifying evidence. This information includes a criminal's access to private or public transport, characteristics of outdoor surveillance systems, the volume and weight of a criminal's assets, including stolen assets, dirt on their face or clothes, their emotional condition. The author concludes that it is necessary to simultaneously develop state-owned geoinformation systems reflecting data on crime in general as well as specific crimes, and similar private special-purpose projects.

AB  - A survey of empirical research concerning the determinants of an individual's perceptions of the risk of formal sanctions as a consequence of criminal behavior. The specific questions considered are: (1) How accurate is people's knowledge about criminal sanctions? (2) How do people acquire and modify their subjective probabilities of punishment risk? (3) How do individuals act on their risk perceptions in specific criminal contexts?
   Three broad classes of extant studies are reviewed. The first is the relationship between objective sanctions, sanction enforcement, and risk perceptions-research that includes calibration studies and correlational studies. The second is the relationship between punishment experiences (personal and vicarious) and change in risk perceptions, in particular, research that relies on formal models of Bayesian learning. The third is the responsiveness of would-be offenders to immediate environmental cues-a varied empirical tradition that encompasses vignette research, offender interviews, process tracing, and laboratory studies.
   First, research concerning the accuracy of risk perceptions suggests that the average citizen does a reasonable job of knowing what criminal penalties are statutorily allowed, but does a quite poor job of estimating the probability and magnitude of the penalties. On the other hand, studies which inquire about more common offenses (alcohol and marijuana use) from more crime-prone populations (young people, offenders) reveal that perceptions are consistently better calibrated to actual punishments. Second, research on perceptual updating indicates that personal experiences and, to a lesser degree, vicarious experiences with crime and punishment are salient determinants of changes in risk perceptions. Specifically, individuals who commit crime and successfully avoid arrest tend to lower their subjective probability of apprehension. Third, research on the situational context of crime decision making reveals that risk perceptions are highly malleable to proximal influences which include, but are not limited to, objective sanction risk. Situational risk perceptions appear to be particularly strongly influenced by substance use, peer presence, and arousal level.
   The perceptual deterrence tradition is theoretically rich, and has been renewed in the last decade by creative empirical tests from a variety of social scientific disciplines. Many knowledge gaps and limitations remain, and ensuing research should assign high priority to such considerations as sampling strategies and the measurement of risk perceptions.

AB  - Large geographic areas should host a greater diversity of crime compared with small geographic areas. This proposition is reasonable given that larger geographic areas should not only support more crime but also contain a greater diversity of criminogenic settings. This article uses a neutral model to characterize crime richness as a function of area. The model starts with two neutral assumptions: 1) that all environments are statistically equivalent and exert no influence on what types of crimes occur there; and 2) that different crime types occur independently of one another. The model produces rigorous predictions for the mean and variance in crime richness with increasing area. Tests of the model against a sample of 172,055 crimes occurring in Los Angeles during the year 2013 are qualitatively consistent with neutral expectations. The model is made quantitatively consistent by constant scaling. Resampling experiments show that at most 20 percent of the mean crime richness is attributable to nonrandom clustering and assortment of crime types. A modified neutral model allowing for variation crime concentration is consistent with observed variance in crime richness. The results suggest that very general and largely neutral laws may be driving crime diversity in space.

AB  - Objectives Longitudinal studies from the criminology of place suggest crime hot spots are repeatedly found in the same locations within cities over extended periods of time. Program evaluations of hot spots policing interventions often use much shorter temporal windows to define hot spots. This study examines if stability of patterns is still found when using short and intermediate periods of time to measure crime hot spots. Methods We examined 765,235 total crime incidents reported to the Cincinnati Police Department from 1997 to 2016. These incidents were geocoded to 13,189 street segments. We created measures of crime hot spots based on varying temporal periods using three different strategies: pooled observations, group-based trajectory modeling, and k-means clustering. These measures were compared using techniques associated with survival analyses to determine the influence of temporal specification on the retrospective identification of crime hot spots. Results Our findings suggest regardless of the temporal specification, most street segments identified as crime hot spots remained crime hot spots across the observed follow-up periods. There was still much variability in patterns based upon temporal specifications and the use of additional years of incident report data did not uniformly provide an improved understanding of which street segments remained crime hot spots. Conclusions Program evaluations of hot spots policing strategies do not need to use extended periods of time to observe stability in crime hot spots. The criminology of place should provide more attention to the topic of temporal specification and continue exploring the utility of crime hot spots.

AB  - Crime and criminality are global concerns that pose significant risks to societal well-being and quality of life. The urbanization process and the land use of cities profoundly influence the occurrence, types, and intensity of crimes. The design and management of cities play a pivotal role in ensuring overall safety and security. Although Kolkata is considered a safe city, recent reports from the National Crime Records Bureau highlight an increase in crimes against women, placing Kolkata as the second-highest in West Bengal. The crime rate in the city has witnessed a substantial 63.46% increase over the past three years, categorized as "high" on the rating scale. Little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of crimes in Kolkata. This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of murder, theft, snatching, drugging, pickpocketing, and crimes against women, using regression models. Using geoinformatics and geostatistics, the research also seeks to identify the spatial clustering, significant crime hotspots, and their shifting between 2015 and 2020 and also attempts to analyze the impact of urban land use on crime rates. The study reveals a significant temporal change in crime patterns over 30 years, with bare land consistently impacting crime across all categories. While thefts, snatching, pickpocketing, drugging, and crimes against women exhibit relatively stable hotspots, murder hotspots have increased and become more dispersed. The unique land use patterns of port areas influence murder, drugging, and crimes against women, while dense built-up spaces contribute to higher rates of pickpocketing.

AB  - Purpose. Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example.
   Methods. Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour - central place foraging, Brownian walks and Levy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Levy walks, respectively.
   Results. Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Levy walks.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Levy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed.

AB  - Studies on crime and mobility primarily focus on local crime patterns. The city has long played an important role, whether analysing the offence or the offender. This paper goes beyond city boundaries and discusses 'outbound offenders', whose crime trips start in a city, but end outside. It is argued that a substantial proportion of crime trips follow this pattern, indicating that areas other than cities also provide interesting opportunities for property crime. We link outbound offending to a number of features that may explain crime travelling, including the target's features and offender/offence features. We find that outbound offending mostly occurs towards affluent target regions and near motorways, as such confirming findings from previous research. We also find crime sprees to be indicative for mobile offending. Thus, mobile property offenders tend to compensate for travelled distances, not only by targeting affluent areas and using fast transportation means, but also by committing several successive offences, hereby reducing their relative transportation cost for each offence.

AB  - Following Youngjohn, Lees-Haley, and Binder's (1999) comment on Johnson and Lesniak-Karpiak's (1997) study that warnings lead to more subtle malingering, researchers have sought to better understand warning effects. However, such studies have been largely atheoretical and may have confounded warning and coaching. This study examined the effect on malingering of a warning that was based on criminological-sociological concepts derived from the rational choice model of deterrence theory. A total of 78 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unwarned simulator group, or one of two warned simulator groups. The warning groups comprised low- and high-level conditions depending on warning intensity. Simulator participants received no coaching about how to fake tests. Outcome variables were scores derived from the Test of Memory Malingering and Wechsler Memory Scale-III. When the rate of malingering was compared across the four groups, a high-level warning effect was found such that warned participants were significantly less likely to exaggerate than unwarned simulators. In an exploratory follow-up analysis, the warned groups were divided into those who reported malingering and those who did not report malingering, and the performance of these groups was compared to that of unwarned simulators and controls. Using this approach, results showed that participants who were deterred from malingering by warning performed no worse than controls. However, on a small number of tests, self-reported malingerers in the low-level warning group appeared less impaired than unwarned simulators. This pattern was not observed in the high-level warning condition. Although cautious interpretation of findings is necessitated by the exploratory nature of some analyses, overall results suggest that using a carefully designed warning may be useful for reducing the rate of malingering. The combination of some noteworthy effect sizes, despite low power and the small size of some groups, suggests that further investigation of the effects of warnings needs to continue to determine their effect more fully.

AB  - If offending were simply displaced following (often spatially) focused crime reduction initiatives, the continued expenditure of resources on this approach to crime reduction would be pointless. The aims of this article were to: critically appraise the current body of displacement research; identify gaps in understanding; articulate an agenda for future research; and to consider the implications of the accumulated findings for practitioners, evaluators, and policy makers.
   First, we review existing criminological theory regarding crime displacement and the alternative perspective-that crime prevention activity might generate a diffusion of crime control benefits. Second, we review the empirical research, focusing in particular on the findings of existing systematic reviews. Third, we consider the types of displacement that might occur and the methodological approaches employed to study them.
   Theoretical and empirical research suggests that displacement is far from inevitable and that a diffusion of crime control benefit is at least as likely. However, some forms of displacement have not been adequately studied.
   Existing research suggests that successful crime reduction interventions often have a positive impact on crime that extends beyond the direct recipients of a particular project. However, current understanding of crime displacement and how benefits might diffuse remains incomplete. Consequently, to inform an agenda for future research, we derive a typology of methodological issues associated with studying displacement, along with suggestions as to how they might be addressed.

AB  - PurposeBehavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders.
   MethodsUsing a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences.
   ResultsFindings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered - some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others.
   ConclusionsThe findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.

AB  - Criminal activities are often unevenly distributed over space. The literature shows that the occurrence of crime is frequently concentrated in particular neighbourhoods and is related to a variety of socioeconomic and crime opportunity factors. This study explores the broad patterning of property and violent crime among different socio-economic stratums and across space by examining the neighbourhood socioeconomic conditions and individual characteristics of offenders associated with crime in the city of Toronto, which consists of 140 neighbourhoods. Despite being the largest urban centre in Canada, with a fast-growing population, Toronto is under-studied in crime analysis from a spatial perspective. In this study, both property and violent crime data sets from the years 2014 to 2016 and census-based Ontario-Marginalisation index are analysed using spatial and quantitative methods. Spatial techniques such as Local Moran's I are applied to analyse the spatial distribution of criminal activity while accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Distance-to-crime is measured to explore the spatial behaviour of criminal activity. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression is conducted to explore the ways in which individual and neighbourhood demographic characteristics relate to crime rates at the neighbourhood level. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used to further our understanding of the spatially varying relationships between crime and the independent variables included in the OLS model. Property and violent crime across the three years of the study show a similar distribution of significant crime hot spots in the core, northwest, and east end of the city. The OLS model indicates offender-related demographics (i.e., age, marital status) to be a significant predictor of both types of crime, but in different ways. Neighbourhood contextual variables are measured by the four dimensions of the Ontario-Marginalisation Index. They are significantly associated with violent and property crime in different ways. The GWR is a more suitable model to explain the variations in observed property crime rates across different neighbourhoods. It also identifies spatial non-stationarity in relationships. The study provides implications for crime prevention and security through an enhanced understanding of crime patterns and factors. It points to the need for safe neighbourhoods, to be built not only by the law enforcement sector but by a wide range of social and economic sectors and services.
