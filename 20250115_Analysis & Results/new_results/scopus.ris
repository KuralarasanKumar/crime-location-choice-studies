AB  - The purpose of this article is to present a model of criminal victimization as the final stage in a process of events that can be anticipated, recognized, and managed. Criminal victimization is viewed as the last link in a chain of progressively dangerous, purposeful, and highly visible interactions between the target and the aggressor. The process starts with the criminals selecting attractive, accessible, and vulnerable targets. These targets are enticed to cooperate with criminal foreplay that helps to fabricate trust and build rapport. Once their targets are drawn close, criminals attempt to distract them from recognizing their increasingly aggressive behaviors. As the attacks become more imminent, criminals employ tactics to establish control over their targets. Individuals can influence the flow of events by limiting criminal opportunity and reducing vulnerability. Those that recognize criminal foreplay and take proactive self-defense measures early in the process, may cause the criminals to withdraw before they are committed to and confident of their ability to be successful. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Since the release of the Clarke and Newman’s ‘EVIL DONE’ framework in 2006, there has been limited empirical research on its capacity to predict target attractiveness and vulnerability as intended. This study investigated the utility of the framework in the context of the current United Kingdom (UK) threat landscape, including additions from the [Marchment, Z., & Gill, P. (2022). Spatial decision making of terrorist target selection: Introducing the TRACK framework. Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, 45(10), 862–880. https://doi.org/10.1080/1057610X.2020.1711588] TRACK framework using UK terrorist incidents between 2015 and 2021 (n = 184). For the UK as a whole ‘EVIL DONE’ may not be the best approach to predicting and mitigating the threat. Analysis of cases from Great Britain only demonstrates greater usefulness of the framework in explaining the attractiveness of targets. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Examine the place-based correlates of robbery activity displaced by a foot-patrol intervention in Newark, NJ. We use constructs from Crime Pattern and Social Disorganization theories to test hypotheses concerned with associations between the structure of the environment and the displacement of crime. Method: Robbery incidents were spatially joined to street segments to study micro-level displacement processes. Predictor variables were operationalized using data from the Newark Police Department and Infogroup USA. Generalized Linear models tested associations between the characteristics of street segments and displaced robbery in the target area as compared to a control. Results: Environmental structure is important to understanding the settings of displacement, though this varied between spatial and temporal displacement. Relationships between displaced crime activity and model covariates did not always appear in expected directions. For example, bus stops predicted increased spatial displacement while corner stores predicted decreased levels of temporal displacement. Conclusions: While testing for displacement has become commonplace in place-based policing interventions, less attention has been paid to the micro-level factors that may facilitate the displacement of crime events. Both bus stops and corner stores show consistent associations with displaced crime activity, but the directions of these relationships suggest more complex processes requiring further examination. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article studies how burglars select a house to burglarize. We draw on the rational choice perspective to investigate how burglars select a target by relying on house-related attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk. It extends current applications of the discrete spatial choice framework to burglary target selection by adopting the house as the spatial unit of analysis and studies burglars' target selection process in a larger and more diverse study area than that of earlier studies. Using data on 650 residential burglaries and on approximately 500,000 residential properties in the Belgian province East Flanders, we consider a discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection to establish which house-related attributes influence burglars' target selection process. Our findings demonstrate that terraced houses, houses without a garage, houses that have not been outfitted with a central heating and/or air-conditioning system and houses nearby burglars' residences are more likely to be selected. Overall, our analysis suggests that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets while higher perceived rewards actually decrease the odds of a house being burglarized. Risk-related attributes are unimportant for burglars' target choice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Since 2002, seven iterations of the Drug Use Monitoring in Australia (DUMA) programme survey have asked arrested offenders about their stealing behaviours, including questions relating to stolen goods target selection and disposal. Throughout this same time period, stealing and domestic burglary rates in Australia have steadily declined. This paper examines the DUMA data with these high-level acquisitive crime trends in mind. Survey findings point to offenders having shifted away from stealing increasingly devalued electronic consumer goods for resale purposes, and toward stealing increasingly expensive food and clothing for personal consumption. This is consistent with what would be expected according to Consumer Price Index data, the opportunity-based CRAVED framework, and offender domain expertise. Applied and theoretical implications are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objectives: We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urbancontext by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations andpresence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods: The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results: The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closerto their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offendinglocations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors andgenerators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions: By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime locationchoice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discusslimitations and make suggestions for future investigations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that “taste” preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-tocrime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders likely commit crimes in areas where their awareness space overlaps with criminal opportunity. If both are necessary conditions for crime to take place somewhere, their influence on crime location choice likely depends upon one another. Interactions between two activity nodes-residential area of (1) offenders, (2) offenders' family-and two criminal opportunity indicators-number of bars/restaurants/hotels, collective efficacy-were tested and found (N = 13,088 any-crime-type offences committed by 5377 offenders): both residential area types were more often targeted than areas where offenders/family did not live, with no/lesser difference between low versus high criminal opportunity. Areas where offenders/family did not live were statistically significantly least often targeted when criminal opportunity there was low. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime. © 2015 by the American Society of Criminology.

AB  - Many offenses take place close to where the offender lives. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offenders also might commit crimes near their former homes. Building on crime pattern theory and combining information from police records and other sources, this study confirms that offenders who commit robberies, residential burglaries, thefts from vehicles, and assaults are more likely to target their current and former residential areas than similar areas they never lived in. In support of the argument that spatial awareness mediates the effects of past and current residence, it also is shown that areas of past and present residence are more likely to be targeted if the offender lived in the area for a long time instead of briefly and if the offender has moved away from the area only recently rather than a long time ago. The theoretical implications of these findings and their use for investigative purposes are discussed, and suggestions for future inquiry are made. © 2010 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - The present article examines the key concepts underlying victimization theories (i.e., exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, guardianship). Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization. © 1990, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

AB  - Background: The Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) system, jointly developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission and various partners, is a web-based platform that facilitate the monitoring of information on public health threats in near real-time from thousands of online sources. Aims: To assess the capacity of the EIOS system to strengthen data collection for neglected diseases of public health importance, and to evaluate the use of EIOS data for improving the understanding of the geographic extents of diseases and their level of risk. Methods: A Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) model was implemented to map the risk of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) occurrence in 52 countries and territories within the European Region between January 2012 and March 2022 using data on CCHF occurrence retrieved from the EIOS system. Results: The model found a positive association between all temperature-related variables and the probability of CCHF occurrence, with an increased risk in warmer and drier areas. The highest risk of CCHF was found in the Mediterranean basin and in areas bordering the Black Sea. There was a general decreasing risk trend from south to north across the entire European Region. Conclusion: The study highlights that the information gathered by public health intelligence can be used to build a disease risk map. Internet-based sources could aid in the assessment of new or changing risks and planning effective actions in target areas. © 2023 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

AB  - Objectives: This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders. Methods: Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders’ spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age. Results: Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders. Conclusions: This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This article analyzes how street robbers decide on where to attack their victims. Using data on nearly 13,000 robberies, on the approximately 18,000 offenders involved in these robberies, and on the nearly 25,000 census blocks in the city of Chicago, we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers. We demonstrate that they attack near their own homes, on easily accessible blocks, where legal and illegal cash economies are present, and that these effects spill over to adjacent blocks. © The Author (2012).

AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders’ previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders’ knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location’s crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted. Using data in 3337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before. This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent. Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders’ knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders’ pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members’ home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge—where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities—and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders’ crime location choices. © 2024 Georgia State University.

AB  - Interest in data-driven crime simulations has been growing in recent years, confirming its potential to advance crime prevention and prediction. Especially, the use of new data sources in crime simulation models can contribute towards safer and smarter cities. Previous work on agent-based models for crime simulations have intended to simulate offender behavior in a geographical environment, relying exclusively on a small sample of offender homes and crime locations. The complex dynamics of crime and the lack of information on criminal offender’s movement patterns challenge the design of offender movement in simulations. At the same time, the availability of big, GPS-based user data samples (mobile data, social media data, etc.) already allowed researchers to determine the laws governing human mobility patterns, which, we argue, could inform offender movement. In this paper, we explore: (1) the use of location-based venue data from Foursquare in New York City (NYC), and (2) human dynamics insights from previous studies to simulate offender movement. We study 9 offender mobility designs in an agent-based model, combining search distances strategies (static, uniform distributed, and Lévy-flight approximation) and target selection algorithms (random intersection, random Foursquare venues, and popular Foursquare venues). The offender behavior performance is measured using the ratio of crime locations passed vs average distance traveled by each offender. Our initial results show that agents moving between POI perform best, while the performance of the three search distance strategies is similar. This work provides a step forward towards more realistic crime simulations. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - This article provides some suggestive evidence that crime risk increases at the intersection of offender awareness and victim unawareness spaces using data from a crime survey. This is evident as 31.7% of self-reported victimization occurs more than 10 min away from the victim's home. About 78.2% of personal theft and 0.20% of burglary (both including attempts) occurred outside the victim's immediate locality. These figures reveal a stronger link between victim movement and certain types of crime. Furthermore, they presumably give evidence that while personal theft occurs frequently, burglary only occurs in rather rare and specific circumstances at some distance from the victim's home. The study therefore concludes that it is the intersection of the offender's and the victim's movements at a time and in a given place that presents the opportunity for crime to occur. The study suggests that where both victim and offender have traveled short distances and/or are locals, community-related approaches may plausibly have roles to play in preventing crime. On the contrary, cautions to strangers, warnings to travelers, and external importation of guardianship as well as situational prevention measures are more appropriate crime prevention strategies when the victim is not local. © 2014 © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of micro-level place on identity theft victimization. This study uses the 2016 Identity Theft Supplement (ITS) to investigate whether aspects of an individual’s residence affect their likelihood of becoming identity theft victims. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct logistic regressions of whether a respondent was an identity theft victim in the past year using the following variables as key predictors: number of housing units in a residence, whether the respondent operates a business out of their residence and if residence access is restricted. Findings: The results suggest that location influences the likelihood of identity theft to a modest degree though some aspects of location (possibly those related to rewards perceptions) may be more relevant than others. Meanwhile, though location may influence initial target selection, whether someone is victimized may be more dependent on factors such as personal behavior. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this manuscript represents one of the first investigations into the relationship between microlevel place and the incidence of identity theft. Furthermore, it provides evidence that one does exist which bears further inquiry. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The Hartford Residential Neighborhood Crime Control Program was a comprehensive, environmentally oriented research effort aimed at examining the process involved in successful crime prevention programming. This innovative "process approach"to crime control involved three majorresearch activities: (a) the conduct of a detailed crime problem analysis in the target area, using comprehensive data to identify the particular features of the neighborhood which were creating opportunities for crime occurrence; (b) the design of a multi-strategy (environmental, police, and community) crime control program directed speciflcally toward the improvement of those conditions found to be contributing to neighborhood crime; and (c) the in-depth evaluation of this approach to crime prevention, including extensive monitoring of the implementation process and a detailed assessment of program impact on crime, fear, and the quality of life in the target area. This paper presents six major evaluation problems confronting most crime control program assessments and describes how each was resolved by Hartford Program evaluators. It is hoped that this discussion of a model program evaluation will be of help to future crime control program researchers in designing their own program evaluations.  © 1981 by ASTM International.

AB  - The present study investigated rationality in sexually motivated burglaries. Specifically, we analyzed the situational cues identified by sexual burglars in their target selection. The research project investigated 224 individual incidents of residential burglary with apparent sexual motivations. Situational characteristics of the incidents were recorded and analyzed using forward sequential regressions. Results indicated that most sexually motivated burglaries occurred in occupied residences with deficient physical guardianship, when the victim was alone. Violence, theft, penetration, and fetishism were found to be committed in circumstances that increased the benefits and lowered the risks. Results showed that sexual burglary is rational in nature—sexual burglars chose residences that were easy to break into. We found little support for the premise that such opportunities arose while carrying out regular burglaries. Instead, the data indicated that sexual burglars acted opportunistically on situational cues that are markedly dissimilar to those of regular burglars. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Legal psychology is field of research which seeks to bring evidence-based practice to the vital work of the criminal justice system. This research is increasingly being conducted and its findings applied around the world. However, worldwide legal systems and their processes can vary greatly. In the current paper, we summarise discussions between legal psychology academics and criminal justice practitioners from Japan. Together, we examine how practices in the Japanese criminal justice system interact with the international evidence base for psychologically-informed ‘best practice’ approaches. Our discussion targets areas of popular study in legal psychology, focusing on concealed crime knowledge detection, line up identification procedures, and investigative interviewing of witnesses, suspects, and victims. Each section features a description of current Japanese practice, followed by a review of the current state of the relevant academic legal psychological literature. We then connect this practice and research synergy to a reflection with suggestions for future research. Taken together, our paper acts as a conduit to incentivise more research and practice collaboration for Japanese and non-Japanese audiences and presents opportunities for collective international legal psychology. © 2024 University of California Press.

AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed.

AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers’ crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers’ crime location choices, but not native robbers’. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives—crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014

AB  - Despite their widespread use during the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks hinder abilities to interpret facial expressions. Yet, they can also reduce the appearance of characteristics that are used to categorize individuals into racial groups, such as Afrocentric features. The color of a face mask might also promote associations with certain types of behavior and professional occupations (e.g., blue surgical mask connoting physician stereotypes; black masks potentially being associated with criminality). This study assessed whether the presence and color of a face mask impacted perceptions of a target male of varying race. White participants (N = 250) were presented with an African American or White male adult face from the Chicago Face Database (of equal age and attractiveness) wearing a blue or black surgical mask, or no mask (Photoshopped onto the face) and rated the man on emotions (happy, sad, angry) as well as how trustworthy, threatening, and attractive the target appeared. Targets wearing a blue surgical mask were judged as more trustworthy and attractive than those wearing no mask (perhaps due to association with medical professions), but these judgements were not qualified by race, despite the African American target’s selection based on Afrocentric features. The color black on a face mask did not exacerbate negative perceptions of targets, perhaps suggesting a decline effect in previously demonstrated associations between this color and criminal actions. Unlike previous research performed at the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic on cloth masks shown to potentially exacerbate racial biases, surgical masks (pleated and made of polymeric materials), appear to lessen potential stereotyping of Black relative to White men. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Poaching is driving many species toward extinction, and as a result, lowering poaching pressure is a conservation priority. This requires understanding where poaching pressure is high and which factors determine these spatial patterns. However, the cryptic and illegal nature of poaching makes this difficult. Ranger patrol data, typically recorded in protected area logbooks, contain information on patrolling efforts and poaching detection and should thus provide opportunities for a better understanding of poaching pressure. However, these data are seldom analyzed and rarely used to inform adaptive management strategies. We developed a novel approach to making use of analog logbook records to map poaching pressure and to test environmental criminology and predator–prey relationship hypotheses explaining poaching patterns. We showcase this approach for Golestan National Park in Iran, where poaching has substantially depleted ungulate populations. We digitized data from >4800 ranger patrols from 2014 to 2016 and used an occupancy modeling framework to relate poaching to (1) accessibility, (2) law enforcement, and (3) prey availability factors. Based on predicted poaching pressure and patrolling intensity, we provide suggestions for future patrol allocation strategies. Our results revealed a low probability (12%) of poacher detection during patrols. Poaching distribution was best explained by prey availability, indicating that poachers target areas with high concentrations of ungulates. Poaching pressure was estimated to be high (>0.49) in 39% of our study area. To alleviate poaching pressure, we recommend ramping up patrolling intensity in 12% of the national park, which could be achievable by reducing excess patrols in about 20% of the park. However, our results suggest that for 27% of the park, it is necessary to improve patrolling quality to increase detection probability of poaching, for example, by closing temporal patrolling gaps or expanding informant networks. Our approach illustrates that analog ranger logbooks are an untapped resource for evidence-based and adaptive planning of protected area management. Using this wealth of data can open up new avenues to better understand poaching and its determinants, to expand effectiveness assessments to the past, and, more generally, to allow for strategic conservation planning in protected areas. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study provides a partial test of the relationship between actor motivations and target suitability using a routine activity framework to understand a form of cybercrime called web defacements. Specifically, the relationships between the visibility, inertia, value, and accessibility of the target in online spaces relative to the unique nonmonetary motivations of the attacker were examined. This study utilized a sample of 138,361 web defacements performed against websites hosted within the Netherlands IP space from January 2011 to April 2017. Seven multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each self-identified motive for the attack, clustered by attacker to minimize the size of standard errors. The findings demonstrated partial support for aspects of routine activity theory to account for differences in offender motivation, suggesting web defacements are similar to other forms of cybercrime. At the same time, motivations differentially shape target selection. © 2020 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology.

AB  - Suspect mobility prediction enables proactive experiences for location-aware crime investigations and offers essential intelligence to the crime initiative prevention. Recent practical studies and Rational Choice Theory suggest that the crime suspect mobility is predictable. The previous approaches for suspect location prediction focused on the forecasting the spatial likelihood of anchor point (i.e. the residential or future offending place) for a suspect who committed a series of crimes. However, the monitoring data are usually poor in availability for tracking suspects. Thus, the existing methodologies failed to capture the complex social location transition patterns for suspects and lacked the capacity to address the mobility data scarcity issue. Therefore, it is intractable to reflect suspects mobility patterns from sparse monitoring data, which reduces the effectiveness of case analysis and crime risk prediction. To address this challenge, we presented a novel Crime Records enhanced Location Prediction (CReLP) model. By merging the historical crime cases information by a collaborative filtering process, the CReLP model the estimate the visiting intensity at any arbitrary spatiotemporal node for and individual suspect. Particularly, we first obtained basic spatial and temporal units by partitioning the target areas into 100×100 2D grids and segmenting the daytime into 24 time bins. Second, we built a 3D tensor to model the social mobilities of all suspects with each entry in it representing the visiting intensity at each location and each time bin for each suspect. Meanwhile, this approach employed two matrices to express general movement trends among all suspects. Third, we created a suspect-correlation matrix relying on the spatial and temporal proximities of their historical crime events, as well as the similarities between their personal properties. At last, the missing entries in the 3D tensor were filled through the joint decomposition across all tensors and matrices mentioned above. This way were able to uncover the spatial distribution pattern for each suspect at any time. We evaluated the CReLP model using a real-world suspect mobility dataset collected from 241 suspects over 6 months with about 19 thousand location records. The results showed that our model outperformed three baseline approaches by 32% to 63% at RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and 14% to 26% in TMSD (Top- k Minimum Search Distance), respectively. Finally, a suspect's visiting spatial distributions of the ground truth and predicting results between 8 to 12 a.m. were illustrated to show the performance of our proposed model. © 2018, Science Press.

AB  - Objectives: The main objective of this study was to see if the characteristics of offenders' crimes exhibit spatial patterning in crime neutral areas by examining the relationship between simulated travel routes of offenders along the physical road network and the actual locations of their crimes in the same geographic space. Method: This study introduced a Criminal Movement model (CriMM) that simulates travel patterns of known offenders. Using offenders' home locations, locations of major attractors (e.g., shopping centers), and variations of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm we modeled the routes that offenders are likely to take when traveling from their home to an attractor. We then compare the locations of offenders' crimes to these paths and analyze their proximity characteristics. This process was carried out using data on 7,807 property offenders from five municipalities in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) in British Columbia, Canada. Results: The results show that a great proportion of crimes tend to be located geographically proximal to the simulated travel paths with a distance decay pattern characterizing the distribution of distance measures. Conclusion: These results lend support to Crime Pattern Theory and the idea that there is an underlying pattern to crimes in crime neutral areas. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Only a few studies so far have analyzed specific environmental factors of cul-de-sacs' influence on safety from crime. To understand crime, streets' physical characteristics need to be considered along with the collective sociodemographic characteristics of each region. A model was designed that combines the physical characteristics of cul-de-sacs with the demographic characteristics of neighborhoods to examine the effect of such characteristics on the crime rate in cul-de-sacs. The physical characteristics of cul-de-sacs in a target area were categorized and examined based on connectivity, accessibility, and visibility, in addition to sociodemographic characteristics. A hierarchical linear model was then constructed from the collected data related to connectivity, accessibility, visibility, and sociodemographic characteristics at the neighborhood level. Finally, the results of the analyses were combined to determine their relationship with the crime rate. Except for a few variables, the results are significant for connectivity, visibility, and accessibility, which allows for an explanation of the occurrence of burglaries when sociodemographic factors are additionally accounted for. © 2017, Architectural Institute of Japan.

AB  - This article aims to review empirical research on residential burglary over the last three to four decades and relate these findings to a model of 'dysfunctional expertise' (Nee & Ward, this issue) that is rooted in mainstream cognitive psychology. It begins with a description of the elements of expertise that might fit in to this model and then traces the offender's decision-chain, using the model as an explanatory tool. Studies have shed light on: the automatic and habitual appraisal of the criminogenic environment during the daily, routine activities of the burglar and his journey to crime; accruing situational awareness and automatic recognition of cues signifying vulnerable properties during target selection; and speedy deployment of offending scripts based on tried and tested methods when entering and carrying out the crime. The review highlights how little is known about decisions, reflections and emotions after the crime. Aspects of the model that require development through further research, as well as the value of using the model for crime prevention purposes, are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Offenders' crime location choices have been a central theme of criminological research. However, little is known about the difference by offenders' age in their crime location choices. Based on the perspective of offender spatial decision-making, this study explores the variation in crime location choices committed by street robbers in different age groups, and examines how age-related activity nodes, journey to crime, and social disorganization influence street robbers' location choices in a large Chinese city. This study examines 7860 street robberies committed by 4358 street robbers between 2012 and 2016 in ZG city, China. A conditional logit selection model was estimated to assess street robbers' crime location choice preferences. The results demonstrate that street robbers favor areas frequented by their age group, close to their residence, and low in social cohesion. Cybercafés affect juvenile and young adult robbers' crime location choices, while transportation hubs impact those of young adult robbers and adult robbers. Schools affect all three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. Besides, the distance of journey to crime plays a significantly negative role in an offender's target choice, with the greatest impact in the youngest age group. These findings add insight to the clarification of the difference by age in offenders' crime location choices. © 2022

AB  - Crime location choice has been a central theme of crime geography research. However, the current research reveals little about the spatial differences among different age groups of criminals when they choose crime locations. Using kernel density estimation and discrete spatial choice models in ZG City, China, this study aims to explore the spatial variation in crime location choices of street robbers at different ages. We also examine the different influences of activity nodes, supervision role, and social disorganization on crime location choice. The results demonstrate that there are significant spatial differences in crime location choices by street robbers at different ages. Juvenile robbers tend to commit crimes in labor-intensive industrial clusters and primary and secondary school areas, young adult robbers tend to commit crimes only in labor-intensive industrial clusters, and adult robbers prefer urban areas with transportation hubs. Additionally, this study demonstrates that age-related activity nodes, the supervision role of the ambient population, and the proportion of youngsters are the main factors for such spatial differences. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Cybercafés have impact on crime location choices of juvenile and young adult robbers, while transportation hubs affect those of young adult and adult robbers, and bars and schools influence all the three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. (2) The supervision role exerted by the ambient population is greater for young adult and adult robbers compared with juvenile robbers. (3) Young adult robbers are more likely to target communities with more youngsters but juvenile and adult robbers are not. (4) Journey to crime has a significant negative effect on target choices, especially on juvenile robbers. In addition, these findings have great informative value for crime prevention and social governance. For example, (i) in labor-intensive industrial clusters where juvenile robbers frequently commit crimes, we can regulate the number of age-related activity nodes such as cybercafés and bars; (ii) in transportation hubs and their surrounding communities where adult robbers commit crimes intensively, we can encourage the persistence of the ambient population to persist and play a better supervision role; (iii) in communities predominated by youth population, we can survey delinquent juveniles to enhance the precise guidance and support. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. © 2009 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - The geographic concentration and diffusion of crime and deviancy are longstanding criminological inquiries, yet few studies have examined how certain illicit behaviors transcend neighborhood borders and connect neighborhoods in patterns of crime and deviancy. A structural neighborhood interdependence may account for the enduring nature and spread of crime, making it critical to understand how neighborhoods are connected in crime patterns to guide crime prevention and disruption efforts. This study examines neighborhood interdependence through the case of repeat buyers of commercial sex in illicit massage businesses in a metropolitan city in the United States. By frequenting venues for illicit commercial sex in multiple neighborhoods, buyers create inter-neighborhood connections through which the demand for an illicit market can spread across neighborhoods. Using online review data about buyers of commercial sex, this study analyzes this neighborhood interdependence as a network comprised of nodes (“neighborhoods”) and edges (“connections between neighborhoods”). Exponential random graph models were used to analyze how characteristics of neighborhoods, the space between neighborhoods, and the overall network of neighborhoods explain inter-neighborhood connectivity in an illicit market for commercial sex. The implications for research, policy, and practice will be discussed. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigates the deterrent effects of incremental levels of guardianship on residential burglary and assesses how burglars differ from non-burglars in terms of their perceptions of opportunities for burglary. Methods: In a virtual reality experiment, 181 incarcerated burglars and 172 non-burglars (university students) were tasked to appraise a virtual neighbourhood in search of a burglary target. During the appraisal process, participants were exposed to different levels of guardianship, ranging from the mere presence of a guardian to an intervening guardian. Results: The presence of a guardian deterred both burglars and non-burglars alike, with only negligible incremental effects for levels of guardianship. For burglars, guardianship increased the perceived likelihood of being caught and the perceived level of social cohesion, whereas it decreased neighbourhood attractiveness. The burglars differed from the non-burglars in terms of how they appraised the virtual neighbourhood, clearly reflecting differences in expertise between both groups. Conclusions: With respect to residential burglary, the results suggest that guardians—in line with the original notion of guardianship developed by Cohen and Felson (American Sociological Review, 44(4), 588–608, 1979)—serve as a deterrent simply by being present. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Based on an offender spatial decision-making perspective, this burglary target location choice study aims to understand how physical and social barriers affect why residential burglars commit their crimes at particular locations in a major Chinese city. Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders’ crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times. Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models. Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime. Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender’s home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers’ location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Background: Police agencies across the globe enforce laws that prohibit drug transportation, distribution, and use with varying degrees of effectiveness. Within the United States, law enforcement strategies that rely on partnerships between criminal justice officials, neighbourhood residents, and social service providers (i.e., collaborative implementation) have shown considerable promise for reducing crime and disorder associated with open-air drug markets. The current study examines a comprehensive police enforcement strategy conducted in Peoria, Illinois (USA) designed to reduce patterns of crime and violence associated with an open-air drug market in a specific neighbourhood. Methods: Change in neighbourhood crime was assessed using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) interrupted time series analysis. Further, target area residents were surveyed to gauge their awareness of the police intervention as well as perceived changes in local crime patterns. Results: Analyses indicate that the intervention did not produce significant changes in neighbourhood crime offense rates between pre- and post-intervention periods. In addition, the majority of surveyed residents within the target area did not demonstrate an awareness of the intervention nor did they report perceived changes in local crime patterns. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that police-led approaches in the absence of high levels of community awareness and involvement may have less capacity to generate crime-control when focusing on open-air drug markets. We propose that police agencies adopting this strategy invest considerable resources toward achieving community awareness and participation in order to increase the potential for attaining significant and substantive programmatic impact. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crime pattern theory predicts that offenders commit offences in their activity spaces. We also propose that they most likely offend in the more frequently visited parts. Previous studies used offenders' residential areas or other activity space proxy measures but lacked data on other routinely visited places (e.g., work, school, and leisure activities). A major contribution of this study is the use of an online survey in which 78 offenders reported on their own activity spaces and committed offences (n = 140). Results show that offending is much more likely in offenders' activity spaces than elsewhere, and effects increase with visiting frequency. Although residential area is a good predictor, offenders' more extensive self-reported activity spaces predict much better where they commit offences. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Crime is increasingly recognized as a problem by persons responsible for facility site selection and premises security. Environmental criminology can contribute to crime prevention through analyses of spatial patterns in crime, perceptions and awareness spaces of potential criminals, criminal mobility patterns, and the processes of target selection and decision to commit a criminal act. Rational choice theory is utilized to illustrate the decisionmaking process employed by many criminals. Although physical target-hardening measures are relevant to environmental criminology, the social interaction dimension among criminals, victims, bystanders, and certain aspects of the environment are central. Levels of security necessary for a given location may be established through consideration of the probability of attack at a given location, the vulnerability of this location to such an attack, and the critically or importance of any resultant loss to the continuing viability of the organization. © 1990.

AB  - Crime is unevenly distributed in space. This chapter discusses the uneven spatial patterns in crime from an offender decision-making perspective. It describes the main theoretical perspectives in environmental criminology (the rational choice perspective, routine activity approach, and crime pattern theory) and reviews the empirical research with an emphasis on studies that have used a discrete spatial choice framework for analyzing individual crime location choices. The strength of the discrete spatial choice framework, several of its assumptions, and its link with random utility maximization theory are discussed. The chapter concludes with several challenges for future crime location choice research, including challenges regarding temporal aspects of criminal decision making, planned versus opportunistic crimes, and solved versus unsolved crimes. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - Objectives: To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars’ choice of residence to burglarize. Methods: We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars’ target choice in a conditional logit model. Results: Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions: Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars’ target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brownfield redevelopment projects are often perceived as more risky than greenfield investment, and financing opportunities may be more limited and expensive. Different financial support projects have been developed to support regeneration projects, and empirical evidence has shown that all buildings near the intervention area may benefit from an increase in prices once the brownfield project is complete. The article considers the Connecticut market and evaluates the characteristics of the brownfield projects that had access to a financial support program (loan or grant), the impact of the regeneration process on the liquidity of the housing market, and the gap between the price and the appraisal value of the residential unit. Target areas for this type of financing program are mainly characterized by low income, a high density of population, a high incidence of homeowners, and a high crime rate. Once completed, the brownfield requalification has an impact on the housing market because the brownfield recovery reduces the number of house sales due to the increase in the average price in the surrounding area and makes the selling price more consistent with the appraisal valuation. The empirical evidence provided may be useful for public institutions that are suffering from budget constraints and have to prioritize areas for financial support solutions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - How and why offenders decide to offend where they do is given little consideration in most geographical modeling of crimes. Geometric calculations are applied to crime location data taking no account of the offender’s cognitive processes. If the offender’s behavior is considered it is usually only in terms of the simple logic of his optimizing his benefits whilst minimizing his efforts. This costbenefit logic tends also to be based on the equally naive assumption that criminals have an informed understanding of the distribution of opportunities for crime. Yet for well over 40 years it has been clear that nobody makes use of his or her physical environment like an efficiently programmed automaton. There are many biases and heuristics built into our cognitive representations of our surroundings that influence what we do where. There is growing evidence that criminals are probably even more prone to these distorted mental representations of what is criminally possible (Canter and Hodge 2000). Future improvement of crime mapping systems will therefore need to take account of this Psychology of Place (Canter 1977). © 2008 David Canter and Donna Youngs.

AB  - The evaluation of the Small Business and Crime Initiative in Leicester involved before and after victimisation surveys of all businesses in the two target areas. The second was conducted exactly two years after the first. Each sweep achieved a response rate of 65%. A panel sample of 483 businesses took part in both surveys. The results afford an opportunity to track crime experience over time. This paper reports findings about the patterns of continuity and change in victimisation amongst members of the panel sample. Four groups are distinguished: those with low crime levels in both sweeps, those with high crime levels in both sweeps, those going from relatively high to relatively low levels, and those going from relatively low to relatively high levels. Identifying triggers leading from low to high rates of victimisation and from high to low ones clearly has implications for prevention. There may be scope usefully also to track victimisation careers of non-business victims of crime. © 2001, A B Academic Publishers. Printed in Great Britain. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individuals with serious mental illness are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and face difficulties accessing mental health services both during incarceration and upon re-entry into the community. This study examines how such individuals describe their experiences receiving care both during and after their time in custody and explores the perspectives of mental health service providers who treat this population upon re-entry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 43 individuals identified as having a history of serious mental illness and criminal justice involvement, as well as with 25 providers who have worked with this population. Clients noted the stress of transitioning to criminal justice settings, the uneven availability of services within jail and prison, and the significant challenges faced upon re-entry. Providers reported barriers to working with this population, including minimal coordination with the criminal justice system and challenging behaviors and attitudes on the part of both clients and providers. Findings identify potential target areas for improved care coordination as well as for additional provider education regarding the unique needs of this population. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Neighborhood characteristics predict burglary targets, but target attractiveness may be colored by the conditions in which a potential offender resides. We test whether relative differences in concentrated disadvantage, racial/ethnic composition, and ethnic heterogeneity influence where burglars offend, controlling for distance. From a relative deprivation perspective, economically advantaged areas make more attractive targets to burglars residing in disadvantage neighborhoods, but a social disorganization perspective predicts areas lower in social cohesion are most attractive, which may be neighborhoods with greater disadvantage. Methods: Drawing upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in the City of Tampa, Florida from 2000 to 2012, we utilize discrete choice modeling to predict burglar offense destination. Results: Offenders target neighborhoods that are geographically proximate or ecologically similar to their own. When accounting for relative differences, burglars from all neighborhood types are more likely to target highly disadvantaged or heterogeneous neighborhoods. Conclusions: Burglars generally select targets that are similar to their residence. However, when suspects do discriminate, there is evidence that they target neighborhoods that are worse off relative to their own on characteristics such as residential instability, disadvantage, racial composition, and racial/ethnic diversity. These neighborhoods are associated with lower social control and lower risk of detection. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Explaining how offenders choose a crime location is one of the central themes of crime geography. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice mostly considers the impact of the built environment and social environment, without considering the impact of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery and its temporal difference. To fill this gap, this study integrated ambient population and surveillance cameras in assessing street robbers' decision making and its time effects in ZG City of China, by using the discrete spatial choice modeling. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant negative impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a protective role in preventing street robbers' criminal activities. Interestingly, we found that the protective effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. The protective role of ambient population and surveillance cameras is stable daily through the week, but diurnally, the influence of ambient population shows temporal fluctuation, while the impact of surveillance cameras is temporally stable. These findings can be of some reference for police control and crime geography research by: 1) Carrying out the experimental evaluation of surveillance camera system's prevention and control effect, and dynamic optimization and adjustment of surveillance cameralocations. 2) Arranging a suitable amount of mixed functional land in urban planning or urban renewal to strengthen the moderation of ambient population through planning or management. 3) Focusing on diurnal variability in future studies of the time effects. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - This study examined patterns of motor vehicle theft (MVT) in Lagos using routine activity, social disorganization, and Charnov's prey selection models. Findings showed that the rate of auto theft is determined by opportunity, the flow of cars, the level of guardianship and social disorganization factors. Furthermore, the distribution of thefts across car model was very uneven as some cars models were stolen at much higher rates than the others. Charnov's prey selection model suggests that such uneven targeting should be related to variation in the quantity, expected payoffs, and handling costs associated with different car models. Having exploited the quantity, findings confirmed that differences in quantity of car models explained some of the thefts. A comparison of theft and quantity of different car models rank order showed a significant positive relationship (r = 0.617, p <.00). This study found some support for social disorganization theory and routine activity theory as a number of the expected relationships between offenders' characteristics, location variables, and MVT were observed. The study also found support for Charnov's prey selection model as the most common cars on the street of Lagos were also the most stolen. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders’ awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders’ family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members’ residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders’ children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally. © 2016 American Society of Criminology

AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences. © 2019

AB  - In daylight, burglars minimized the risks of being spotted by selecting "up-market" targets with better front cover and low occupancy that reflected the occupants' higher employment levels. After dark, townhouses with less cover were popular despite victims, fewer of whom were employed, raising more alerts. Evidence indicates consistency with routine activity theory, and target strategies appear rational, though shaped by differences in risks and offenders. Lifestyles and routine activities of victims, coupled with daylight and darkness changes, created burglary opportunities. Distinctive daylight and darkness strategies proved attractive to certain types of offenders, so that housing morphology, victims, their lifestyle, risks, rewards and burglar characteristics were distinctively aligned, providing the framework for target and area selection. Theories need to incorporate contrasts in daylight-darkness and housing morphologies, and relate to offender diversity.

AB  - Objectives: This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions. Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - The "journey to crime," or the study of the distance between an offender's residence and offense site, has been a subject of study within criminology for many years. Implications arising from such research touches the majority of criminological theories. An overriding conclusion from this line of research is that most crimes occur in relatively close proximity to the home of the offender. Termed the distance-decay function, a plot of the number of crimes that an offender commits decreases with increasing distance from the offender's residence. In a recent paper, Van Koppen and De Keijser raise the concern that inferring individual distance decay from aggregate-level data may be inappropriate. They assert that previous research reporting aggregated distance-decay functions conceals individual variations in the ranges of operation, which leads them to conclude that the distance-decay function is an artifact. We do not question the claim that researchers should not make inferences about individual behavior with data collected at the aggregate level. However, Van Koppen and De Keijser's analysis raises four important issues concerning (1) the interpretation of the ecological fallacy, (2) the assumption of linearity in offender movements, (3) the interpretation of geographic work on profiling, and (4) the assumption of random target selection within a delimited range of operation. Using both simulated and nonsimulated data, we present evidence that reaches vastly different conclusions from those reached by Van Koppen and De Keijser. The theoretical implications of our analyses and possibilities for future research are addressed.

AB  - Research Summary: In this article, we argue that situational crime prevention (SCP) strategies can be used to prevent public mass violence, as well as to mitigate the harms caused from those attacks that still occur. We draw from the SCP perspective generally, and its application to terrorism particularly, as well as from the public mass violence literature. We focus on the pillars of opportunity that include target selection, weapon selection, tools used, and conditions that facilitate public mass violence attacks. Policy Implications: We conclude that SCP's EVIL DONE risk assessment template could be refined for the public mass violence context. We argue that the exposed, occupied, nearer, and easy dimensions, along with a newly created personal grievance dimension, could be used to identify more at-risk settings that should receive more situational interventions to prevent these attacks. We similarly conclude that SCP's other pillars could be used to prevent these attacks. We outline specific hard and soft interventions that could thwart these attacks. Importantly, we use examples to illustrate that SCP's strategies could effectively mitigate the harms caused by public mass violence attacks that do occur. We also set forth research strategies to test our claims. © 2019 American Society of Criminology

AB  - This paper argues that victimological research on risks can contribute to the study of offender decision-making. It examines some of the problems in conventional approaches to the topic and discusses strengths and weaknesses of surveys of victimization as an additional source of information. It presents and discusses a conceptual framework for examining target selection, the key elements of which are proximity, yield, and accessibility. It presents a "worked example" in the shape of findings on burglary from the British Crime Survey. © 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: The extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Crime Pattern Theory argues that offenders often commit their crimes at major criminal attractors or along the routes that lead to these attractors from other activity nodes in their awareness space. Without knowledge about each offender's awareness space, however, it is not possible to know the nodes they travel to. In this paper, it is assumed that each offender commits their crime along the way to a particular end-destination that they frequent. It thus follows that, for each crime location of an offender, there is an activity path nearby which starts at the offender's home location and ends at a nearby activity node. Since the activity node is not known, but the crime and home locations of offenders are, the method presented in this paper determines the locations of the attractors by statistically extending the path along the road-network from the offender's home location to their crime location. Each offender's movement pattern is based on probabilities assigned to each road segment that are determined by examining the angle of the road in relation to an offender's journey from home, and how frequently the road segment is taken by commuters on the road network. After generating paths for all offenders, attractor locations are identified by calculating the most frequently travelled nodes in the network. The aim of the model is to investigate the influence that crime attractors and other major activity nodes have on the locations of crimes to better understand the target selection behaviour of known offenders. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Geographic offender profiling (GOP) is an investigative activity aimed at locating an offender's residence on the basis of where he or she commits offences. Current tools that assist in GOP assume that spatial opportunity structures for crime are uniform: they assume that potential targets are evenly distributed in space, and that potential targets are equally attractive everywhere. In addition, they assume that travel distance is the only criterion that offenders consider when choosing a crime site. This paper demonstrates that, with the help of an extended target selection model, GOP tools could be improved if they measured and utilized spatial variation in criminal opportunity structures. The results of a computer simulation study illustrate this finding.

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

AB  - Objective: According to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes. Methods: Geocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime. Results: Accounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted. Conclusions: The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Many offenders offend near their home. But what about their former homes? Extending crime pattern theory, and combining data on police recorded robberies with data on the residential histories of the robbers and with a database of postal code areas, we demonstrate that offenders are more likely to commit commercial robberies in their former residential areas than in otherwise similar areas they have never lived in. To investigate the role of the residential history in greater detail, we assess whether duration and recency of past and current residence differentially affect the choice of target areas. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings and make recommendations for future research. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - The association between villages in the city (ViCs) and crime is an important topic but has not been rigorously investigated in crime geography. This study developed three new variables in explaining burglary at the community level: the existence of ViCs, the area of ViCs and the ViC-based segregation index. We extracted all ViCs in the study area from satellite images using machine learning. The relationships between these variables and burglary are tested using two negative binomial models. The existence of ViCs in a community is significantly associated with burglary. Results showed that the ViC communities have more burglary than non-ViC communities. Further, the size of ViCs in a community is the most powerful variable in explaining burglary in ViC communities. Communities with larger ViCs have more burglary. This ViC area variable is critical, given that the number of households, a traditional measure of burglary target, is not effective in a city with ViCs. The co-variates pertaining to disadvantaged population, mixture of locals and non-locals, informal controls, crime generators and accessibility shed light on why ViCs contribute to crime. Finally, ViC-based segregation is not significantly related to burglary. This finding is an important addition to the literature on segregation and crime, a challenging research problem that requires future attention. The high concentration of crime in ViCs calls for targeted intervention strategies by law enforcement agencies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Urban areas are often associated with higher crime rates, which is a growing concern among communities. This study aims to investigate the spatial relation between landuse and property crime in Kuching, Sarawak through location quotient analysis. Three methods were applied in this study: multiple buffer analysis, Pearson’s correlation, and location quotient. Based on initial findings, there is an observed increase in crime levels as the distance from the centroid extends from 150 to 750 meters and decreases beyond 750 meters. The study findings reveal a strong and consistent positive correlation between property crime and land use areas across 2015-2017. Property crime is more prevalent in urban and associated areas compared to other land use categories. Offenders in Kuching often utilise various tools to break into houses and dig holes, break locks, climb gates, engage in snatch theft using motorcycles, and break car windows to steal handbags that are placed on the right seat. In certain locations, CCTV cameras are positioned far away from the target areas. All of these factors contribute to creating opportunities for offenders. Property crimes were more common during the daytime than at night as during the daytime, which may be attributed to more people being active outside their homes, providing criminals with easier targets. At night, people tend to stay home, and the opportunity for property crimes decreases. The study provides crucial geographic crime information to the Commission of Kuching North City Hall and the Council of the City of Kuching South to enhance urban safety. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods: Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results: Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions: Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: To test whether there is a relationship between characteristics of the journey to an outdoor cannabis cultivation site and the total number of plants grown. Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: prime, rugged, dry, and remote. Prime sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying "prime" locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Crime has always been focus of public interest. One of the main concern reasons is due to the negative effects of victimization on the injured party. Burglary is one of the most common crimes. It can lead to other offences such as murder, rape and other violent misdemeanors. Some effects of burglary include time loss, victim?s mental disorder and damage to belongings and house premises. Furthermore, burglary is costly to the government and the public both. Consequently the prevention of burglary may be considered as an essential measure. The "crime prevention through environmental design?, emphasizes that criminal opportunities may be reduced through architectural and planning techniques which might be able to decrease unlawful activity and reduce its occurrence. The most effective measures known to be effective in diminishing burglary are surveillance, occupancy, and accessibility. Improving any of these may help reducing the risk of burglary. It consequently appears to be important to focus on the processes of burglary, accurately studying the course of criminal action from the moment the felon chooses his target to the time he leaves the building; in this way it might be possible to harden the security and accessibility designing an improved security building structure. Urban design, landscape and building planning can influence the decrease of burglary risk. The majority of residential burglars tend to select targets within areas associated with lower levels of risk. The criminals attempt to decrease their apprehension and chances of arrest selecting such under inspected areas. The risks related to a burglary target are the possibility of being seen in the act by neighbors and passers-by, and the difficulty level to access to the premises. Offenders prefer to reduce their evidence by conducting criminal activities during night hours. From the data collected in this research it emerged that most burglaries were conducted during night time. The aim of this article is to consider the effects of time and occupancy on the risk of burglary and find possible solutions through apt architectural design. © Chinese Research Institute of Construction Management.

AB  - This paper explores the structure of organised crime movement across local communities and the drivers underpinning such movement. Firstly, it builds on network analysis to offer a novel methodological approach to empirically and quantitatively study the movement of organised crime offenders across geographical areas. The paper then applies this approach to evidence from Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom. It reconstructs the movement of organised crime members across local areas based on a large-scale police dataset that includes 41 months of recorded crime events. It identifies organised crime “turf” and “target” areas and then explores the drivers of movement from the former to the latter using Exponential Random Graph Models. Findings confirm that geographical distance matters; however, socio-demographic, urban, economic and crime-related characteristics of communities play a key role. Organised crime group members target urban communities with higher than average illegal market opportunities (proxied by drug-related activity). The work also finds the effect of socio-demographic homophily between turf and target communities, suggesting that organised crime group members might target territories that are similar to their own. While a high level of deprivation makes a community more likely to send organised crime members, its impact on a community’s probability of being a receiver is less clear. Finally, the paper offers a way to identify communities (local areas) at risk of being targeted by criminal organisations, thus providing practitioners with a tool for early interventions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail-crime pattern and social disorganization theory-and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder. © 2013 American Society of Criminology.

AB  - This chapter reviews what is known about victim selection-that is, the question of why offenders select some people, but not others, to be victims of crime. It first addresses theoretical perspectives on victim selection, namely the structural-choice model of victim selection, social interactionism, and target congruence. It then describes three data sources that have been used in prior research to study victim selection: police reports, victimization surveys, and offender interviews. Subsequently, empirical findings on victim selection are reviewed and organized into nine subsections: victims' demographic characteristics, psychological characteristics, physical characteristics, behavior, biological characteristics, prior victimization, relationship to the offender, behavior during the offense, and the role of randomness. The final section discusses research gaps and potential future directions in the field, including an emphasis on theoretical explanations and mediators, cross-cultural studies, methodological innovation and diversity, interactions between victim and offender characteristics, and generality across crime types and subpopulations. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - This paper provides new insights on the study of crime modeling through the development of a hybrid cellular automaton (CA) and Multi-agent System (MAS) simulation model that is able to combine components of multiple criminological theories to forecast the locations of residential burglary targets: journey to crime (JTC), social disorganization (SD) theory, and routine activity (RA) theory. In order to combine individual factors from each theory into a unified model, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed for hierarchical parameter selection. The model is then evaluated using data on offenders obtained from the Dallas Police Department to examine how different crime theories perform in the prediction of residential burglary. Compared to the SD- and RA-weighted models, the JTC-weighted model performed the best when comparisons were made to actual burglary locations. The findings demonstrate that the simulation models of crime provide test beds for research into the explanatory power of various crime theories. © 2016, Southern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - Property victimization has increased in recent years in Israel. Apartment burglary and car theft have become a major component in the Israeli public's concern about crime. This paper explores the hypothesis that characteristics of the crime target are central to understanding property victimization. The hypothesis is tested with data from the Third National Israeli Victimization Survey. For apartment burglary, it was found that the larger the number of rooms in the apartment, the higher the risk of victimization. For car theft, it was found that newer cars were more likely to be stolen than older cars. The results shed light on the prominence of property characteristics in the offender's decision-making process and target selection. © 1997 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to identify common features in: the definition of cyber terrorism, cyber terrorism targets, cyber terrorism crimes and then develop effective mitigation strategies and countermeasures to tackle this phenomenon. Through rigorous analysis of literature covering academic articles and official reports, we develop cyber terrorism definition taxonomy which includes five elements: target, motive, means, effect and intention; cyber terrorism targets taxonomy identified from the following target areas: military forces, government cyber and physical infrastructures, critical national infrastructures, social and national identity, and private industry and entities. The cyber terrorism risk factors are classified into main five categories: national security, financial, social and cultural, operational disruption and physical destructions risks. The following identified patterns constituted the cyber terrorism targets taxonomy: incursion, destruction, service interruption, disinformation and web sites defacement. The authors categorized effective strategic approaches to tackle cyber terrorism as: administrative, technological, national and local alliances, international alliances, and education, training and psychological approach. They developed cyber terrorism taxonomies which represent a systematic organization and classification of knowledge that improves scientific awareness of cyber terrorism definition, boundaries, potential targets, crime patterns and effective mitigation strategies. © 2018 by IGI Global.

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice. © Mangai Natarajan 2011.

AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders’ target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders’ searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes. © 2014 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The Bayesian approach covered in this special issue complements the earlier ways of exploring offenders' crime location choices. It is different from earlier approaches in dealing directly with large local data sets of solved crimes to develop statistical models as compared with attempts to derive more generic ways of conceptualising an offender's geographical crime pattern. The two approaches can thus be seen to enshrine different epistemologies; the Bayesian being about a process for deriving patterns in geographically specific data sets, the earlier centre-of-gravity-oriented approaches seeking to establish general theories and principles that are broadly independent of any given locality. They are consequently sensitive to different types of bias in the data available. However, the interesting results achieved through the analysis of Bayesian patterns within crime data does further the consideration of the similarities across offenders in their use of locations for crime and thus has theoretical as well as practical implications. Therefore, these two approaches need to build on each other. This complementarity provides a useful example for other areas of Investigative Psychology. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

AB  - Species identification has become a tool in the investigation of acts of alleged wildlife crimes. This review details the steps required in DNA testing in wildlife crime investigations and highlights recent developments where not only can individual species be identified within a mixture of species but multiple species can be identified simultaneously. 'What species is this?' is a question asked frequently in wildlife crime investigations. Depending on the material being examined, DNA analysis may offer the best opportunity to answer this question. Species testing requires the comparison of the DNA type from the unknown sample to DNA types on a database. The areas of DNA tested are on the mitochondria and include predominantly the cytochrome b gene and the cytochrome oxidase I gene. Standard analysis requires the sequencing of part of one of these genes and comparing the sequence to that held on a repository of DNA sequences such as the GenBank database. Much of the DNA sequence of either of these two genes is conserved with only parts being variable. A recent development is to target areas of those sequences that are specific to a species; this can increase the sensitivity of the test with no loss of specificity. The benefit of targeting species specific sequences is that within a mixture of two of more species, the individual species within the mixture can be identified. This identification would not be possible using standard sequencing. These new developments can lead to a greater number of samples being tested in alleged wildlife crimes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This paper examines offenders’ perspectives about acquisitive crime targets and stolen goods markets in Australia that have not been comprehensively reviewed since 2005. Over the last 18 years there have been significant changes in the rates of property crime, reductions in cash usage, and rapid movements to online markets as a disposal outlet, that motivate this updated analysis. In late 2022, n = 107 detainees in a Western Australian police watchhouse were interviewed about their property offending frequency, offence preferences, target selection, disposal methods, and estimated financial return for targeted goods. Results demonstrated (a) meaningful shifts towards shoplifting and away from the other stealing offences, (b) increases in stealing for personal consumption rather than selling on, (c) declines in preferences for small electronic items, (d) ongoing dependence on drug dealers as a preferred outlet for off-loading stolen goods, (e) disposal of stolen goods is still quick, easy, and typically offenders receive about one-third of the original purchase price for items, and (f) growth in the use of online markets to dispose of stolen goods. The theoretical and applied implications of these findings are discussed, emphasising the importance of opportunity-focused interventions to prevent crime. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study incorporates a quasi-experimental design to evaluate a saturation foot-patrol initiative in Newark, NJ. Violent crime was measured for one year prior and during the initiative within the target area, a surrounding catchment area, and two separate control areas. The overall findings provide further support for foot-patrol as a crime prevention tactic. Total street violence as well as the disaggregate categories of murder, shootings, and nondomestic aggravated assault decreased within the target area absent of any displacement effects. However, robbery suffered from substantial levels of both temporal and spatial displacement, showing saturation foot-patrol to have varying impact on different types of street violence. This finding suggests that police should design large-scale foot-patrol initiatives in a manner that does not allow offenders, particularly robbers, to easily gauge the scope of the intervention and identify alternate crime opportunities. © 2012 © 2012 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.
