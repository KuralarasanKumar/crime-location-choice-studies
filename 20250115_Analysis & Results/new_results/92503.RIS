AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers & connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilizes the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers & connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers & connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, & that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalized evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers & connectors in offender movement & are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

AB  - Based on a rational choice approach, this study compares the decision making involved in the crime commission process of rapists (n = 30), child molesters (n = 17), and victim-crossover sex offenders (n = 22). Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press

AB  - ObjectivesCrime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender’s spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day.MethodsWe put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations.ResultsThe results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders’ activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day.ConclusionOur extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.

AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour.

AB  - According to a rational choice theory of crime location choice, offenders commit crimes at locations where the mix of expected rewards and costs is optimal. The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crime -- illicit drug dealing in an open air drug market -- and tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for criminological theory and research methods. [web URL: http://ccj.sagepub.com/content/31/4/376.abstract]

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases-100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim's gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

AB  - Several complementary theories of criminal victimization (ie, routine activities, lifestyle exposure, & criminal opportunity) have emerged recently to explain changes in crime rates over time, individuals' risk of victimization, & the social ecology of crime. Here, the key concepts underlying victimization theories (ie, exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, & guardianship) are examined, & measures of each concept are developed & evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, & personal violence. Data from 5,271 respondents in the 1982 British Crime Survey provide mixed empirical support for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity & exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness & guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical predictions. It is concluded that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization. Some alternative directions for future research are discussed. 13 Tables, 33 References.

AB  - Within the criminological literature, few studies have been conducted on decision-making and desistance from illicit drug use. Desistance research is plagued with unresolved conceptual and methodological issues. This study uses an in-depth grounded theory approach to examine desistance from marijuana use. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug; involvement with marijuana declines in adulthood. Little is known about the specific reasons people stop using marijuana or the nature of desistance experiences. This research uses the rational choice perspective to examine decision-making processes and patterns of desistance from marijuana use. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 adult current and ex-users of marijuana in Oklahoma City between 2000-2002. Through qualitative analyses, a grounded definition of desistance was developed. A qualitative software program was used to assist with data management and analyses. Adult marijuana users make decisions about desistance by engaging in a complex calculus of the risks and benefits of marijuana use weighed within the context of life circumstances. The results indicate that it is possible to conceptualize desistance as a process and an event. The evidence suggests there are different types of desistance experiences. Periods of desistance varied with regard to duration, finality and outcome. Four categories of factors influenced periods of desistance from marijuana use. These include: lifestyle activities, social considerations, health concerns, and availability. The illegality of marijuana was identified as a key source of conflict for those who desisted from using marijuana. Conflict and calculations of risk were identified as important components of decision-making processes that preceded desistance from marijuana use. Individuals who perceived a conflict between their marijuana use and other life considerations, and viewed the risks of continuing use as high, were most likely to desist from using marijuana. The examples of parenting and employment are used to illustrate this process. The research supports the utility of the rational choice perspective in understanding desistance from marijuana use.

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbers targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

AB  - Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases—100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim’s gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

AB  - Examining the role of individual differences in perceptions of risk and rewards to offending has become an important line of inquire (Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, & Madensen, 2006); however, psychopathy has yet to be considered. We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending.

AB  - Although the study of both offense processes and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender's decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as 'irrational' and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders. Implications of the results are briefly discussed in regard of clinical practice and crime prevention. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that "taste" preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.

AB  - Relying on rational choice theory, we compare burglars' varying levels of offense planning to understand differences among types of burglars. Surveys were collected from a sample of incarcerated male and female burglars in three states. Participants answered questions detailing aspects of a burglary including motivations, target selection, deterrents, and techniques. Comparisons were made between 119 deliberate (32%) and 257 impulsive (68%) burglars. Deliberate burglars focused on obtaining cash, whereas impulsive burglars were more motivated by drug habits. Impulsive burglars were more easily dissuaded from a target when multiple obstacles are present. Burglars consider how many obstacles they may have to overcome, providing support for rational choice-based, situational crime prevention efforts. Differences in burglar motivation emerged and are discussed.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - ObjectivesThe burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders’ choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets.MethodsUsing police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders’ pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members’ homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders’ activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling.ResultsImportance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders’ prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations.ConclusionsImportance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders’ spatial decision making.

AB  - The article examines space-time patterns of maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa. Using rational choice theory and optimal foraging theory as the theoretic frame, 6 years of recorded pirate attack data were used to test whether spatial and temporal attack patterns were independent. The results indicate evidence for a communicability of risk; that is, pirate activity clusters in space and time. Incorporating this finding means that forecasting of high-risk areas could be made more effective. The theoretical implication is that pirates' target selection appears to be consistent with other crime types, such as burglary, car crime and shootings. The results have implications for informing maritime piracy prevention and suppression efforts.

AB  - ObjectivesTo empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars’ choice of residence to burglarize.MethodsWe combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars’ target choice in a conditional logit model.ResultsBurglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection.ConclusionsBoth area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars’ target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.

Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders.

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection.

AB  - Objectives:This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week.Method:The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.Results:The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open.Conclusions:The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

Using data on nearly 13,000 robberies, on the approximately 18,000 offenders involved in these robberies, and on the nearly 25,000 census blocks in the city of Chicago, we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers. We demonstrate that they attack near their own homes, on easily accessible blocks, where legal and illegal cash economies are present, and that these effects spill over to adjacent blocks.

AB  - BACKGROUNDRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an incurable disease characterised by relapses (periods of function loss) followed by full or partial recovery, and potential permanent disability over time. Many disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) exist that help reduce relapses and slow disease progression. Most are contraindicated during conception/pregnancy and some require a discontinuation period before trying to conceive. Although around three-quarters of people with RRMS are women, there is limited knowledge about how reproductive issues impact DMT preference.OBJECTIVEThe aim of this study was to measure the preferences for DMTs of women with RRMS who are considering pregnancy.DESIGNAn online discrete choice experiment (DCE).METHODSParticipants chose between two hypothetical DMTs characterised by a set of attributes, then indicated if they preferred their choice to no treatment. Attributes were identified from interviews and focus groups with people with RRMS and MS professionals, as well as literature reviews, and included the probability of problems with pregnancy, discontinuation of DMTs, and breastfeeding safety. In each DCE task, participants were asked to imagine making decisions in three scenarios: now; when trying to conceive; and when pregnant.ANALYSISTwo mixed logit models were estimated, one to assess the statistical significance between scenarios and one in maximum acceptable risk space to allow comparison of the magnitudes of parameters between scenarios.SAMPLEWomen with RRMS who were considering having a child in the future, recruited from a UK MS patient register.RESULTSSixty respondents completed the survey. Participants preferred no treatment in 12.6% of choices in the 'now' scenario, rising significantly to 37.6% in the 'trying to conceive' scenario and 60.3% in the 'pregnant' scenario (Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.001). This pattern corresponds with results from models that included a no-treatment alternative-specific constant (ASC) capturing differences between taking and not taking a DMT not specified by the attributes. The ASC was lower in the trying to conceive scenario than in the now scenario, and lower still in the pregnant scenario, indicating an intrinsic preference for no treatment. Participants also placed relatively less preference on reducing relapses and avoiding disease progression in the trying to conceive and pregnant scenarios compared with a lower risk of problems with pregnancy. In the trying to conceive scenario, participants' preference for treatments with shorter washout periods increased.CONCLUSIONWomen with RRMS considering having a child prefer DMTs with more favourable reproduction-related attributes, even when not trying to conceive. Reproductive issues also influenced preferences for DMT attributes not directly related to pregnancy, with preferences dependent on the life circumstances in which choices were made. The design of the DCE highlights the benefits of considering the scenario in which participants make choices, as they may change over time.

AB  - Recent research on the process of criminal choice suggests that the deterrent effects of perceived risks vary according to characteristics of the samples studied: while conventional persons appear to be deterred by perceptions of extralegal sanctions, more crime-prone persons appear to give little weight to the perceived threat of either legal or extralegal sanctions. Instead, crime-prone individuals are much more likely to attend to perceived criminal opportunities & rewards. Using longitudinal, individual-level data, examined is whether, within a sample of persons with extensive criminal histories, this general pattern varies with age. A rational choice model of crime is estimated for adults aged 20-34 & 35+, to determine if: (1) perceptions of either legal or extralegal sanctions are more likely to deter the criminal behaviors of older adults, & (2) perceptions of criminal opportunities & returns are less influential for those aged 34+. The results suggest that the process of criminal choice does vary with age: older adults are more likely to respond to perceptions of the legal costs of crime & less likely to respond to the anticipated opportunities for crime.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined political influences on communities' allocations of fiscal and personnel resources to policing. Rational choice theory maintains that these resources are distributed in accordance with the need for crime control, whereas conflict theory argues that they are allocated with the aim of controlling racial and ethnic minorities. Existing research more consistently supports the conflict argument, but important issues remain unaddressed. The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective. Class divisions within the Hispanic community may explain this pattern of findings.

AB  - ObjectivesThis study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders.MethodsAnalyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age.ResultsFindings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders.ConclusionsThis research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.

AB  - OBJECTIVESThis study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions.METHODSTaking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments.RESULTSIn all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions.CONCLUSIONSWhile burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.

AB  - ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - PurposeThis paper analyzes trading and tipping activities in insider trading litigation decided by federal courts from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014.Design/methodology/approachLegal documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were coded to determine profile, patterns of trading and settlement outcomes.FindingsResults of statistical analysis indicate that a defendant in both civil and criminal cases is more likely to trade on the information when he/she receives a direct, financial benefit from breaching his/her duty of confidentiality. The defendant tipper is also more likely to pass on the information to a close personal friend, business associate or family member. The average amount of profit of defendants in both civil and criminal proceedings substantially exceeds the average amount of their settlements.Originality/valueThis paper offers support for the rational choice model – insider trading is often based on rational calculations of benefits not only to the defendant but also to his/her family and associates. Although the threat of civil enforcement and criminal proceedings may possibly deter him/her from committing the crime, results indicate that the amounts of settlement in both proceedings are considerably lower than the amount of profits obtained from the offense.

AB  - OBJECTIVESThis article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week.METHODThe hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home.RESULTSThe hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open.CONCLUSIONSThe results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

AB  - A dynamic choice model of criminal behavior over a criminal career including the acquisition process for both legal and criminal human capital is developed.  The model suggests that to alter the criminal's choice pattern and, therefore, his education toward legal income-producing activities, the first instance of incarceration is the most crucial and that a learning multiplier exists for the criminal in both legal and illegal learning.  Greater segregation of prison populations by ordinal magnitude of offense could better separate criminal students from criminal mentors and further reduce criminal education.  Higher order legal skills training in the penal system may shift the education decision to legal educational pursuits.  Redefining the legal and constitutional rights afforded felons could increase the probability of repeat apprehension and reduce the incentive to repeat offenses.

T1  - Understanding Sustainable Transportation Choices: Shifting Routine Automobile Travel to Walking and Bicycling

AB  - In the two decades since the United States Congress passed the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, there has been a surge of interest in making urban transportation systems more sustainable. Many agencies, representing all levels of government, have searched for strategies to reduce private automobile use, including policies to shift local driving to pedestrian and bicycle modes. Progress has been made in a number of communities, but the automobile remains the dominant mode of transportation in all metropolitan regions. Sustainable transportation advocates are especially interested in routine travel, such as shopping and other errands, because it tends to be done frequently and for distances that could be covered realistically by walking or bicycling. According to the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, Americans made more trips for shopping than for any other purpose, including commuting to and from work. One-third of these shopping trips were shorter than two miles (3.2 km). However, 76% of these short shopping trips were made by automobile, while only 21% were made by walking and 1% by bicycling. In order to identify effective strategies to change travel behavior, practitioners need a greater understanding of why people choose certain modes for routine travel. Choosing to walk or bicycle rather than travel by automobile may help individuals get exercise, save money, interact with neighbors, and reduce tailpipe emissions. Yet, in some communities, non-motorized modes may also require more time and physical effort to run a series of errands, be less convenient for carrying packages and traveling in bad weather, and be perceived as having a higher risk of traffic crashes or street crime than driving. A mixed-methods approach was used to develop a more complete understanding of factors that are associated with walking or bicycling rather than driving for routine travel. An intercept survey was implemented to gather travel data from 1,003 customers at retail pharmacy stores in 20 San Francisco Bay Area neighborhoods in fall 2009. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 26 survey participants in spring and summer 2010 to gain a deeper understanding of factors that influenced their transportation decisions. The methodological approach makes several contributions to the body of research on sustainable transportation. For example, the study: Explored multiple categories of factors that may be associated with walking and bicycling, including travel, socioeconomic, attitude, perception, and shopping district characteristics. Few studies of pedestrian or bicycle mode choices have included all of these categories of factors. Statistical models showed that variables in all categories had significant associations with mode choice. Documented and analyzed short pedestrian movements, such as from a parking space to a store entrance or from a bus stop to home. These detailed data provided a greater understanding of pedestrian activity than traditional travel survey analyses. Walking was used as the primary mode for 65% of respondent trips between stops within shopping districts, and 52% of all respondents walked along a street or between stops at some time between leaving and returning home. Maps of respondent pedestrian path density revealed distinct pedestrian activity patterns in different types of shopping districts. Used four different approaches to capture participant travel mode information. Respondents reported the primary mode of transportation they were using on the day of the survey, the mode they typically used, and all modes that they would consider using to travel to the survey store. They also mapped all stops on their tour and said what modes they used between each stop. These four approaches revealed nuanced travel habits and made it possible to correct inaccuracies in self-reported primary travel mode data. Measured and tested fine-grained local environment variables in shopping districts rather than around respondents' homes. These variables characterized the shopping district area (e.g., sidewalks, bicycle facilities, metered parking, and tree canopy coverage), the main commercial roadway (e.g., posted speed limit, number of automobile lanes, and pedestrian crossing distance), and the survey store site (e.g., number of automobile and bicycle parking spaces and distance from the public sidewalk to the store entrance). This dissertation adds to the small number of studies that have explored how the characteristics of activity destinations are related to travel behavior. The study results contribute to the body of knowledge about factors that may encourage people to shift routine travel from automobile to pedestrian or bicycle modes. After controlling for travel factors such as time and cost, socioeconomic characteristics, and individual attitudes, mixed logit models showed that automobile use was negatively associated with higher employment density, smaller parking lots, and metered on-street parking in the shopping district. Walking was positively associated with higher population density, more street tree canopy coverage, lower speed limits, and fewer commercial driveway crossings. The exploratory analysis of a small number of bicycle tours found that bicycling was associated with more extensive bicycle facility networks and more bicycle parking. However, people were more likely to drive when they perceived a high risk of crime. Results also suggest the magnitude of mode shifts that could occur if short- and long-term land use and transportation system changes were made to each study shopping district. The mode choice model representing travel only to and from the study shopping districts (N = 388) was used to estimate respondent mode shares under the following three scenarios: 1) double population and employment densities in each study shopping district, 2) double street tree canopy coverage in each study shopping district, and 3) eliminate half of the automobile parking 3 spaces at the survey store. Based on the model, the combination of these three changes could increase pedestrian mode share among the 388 sample respondents from 43% to 61% and decrease automobile mode share from 50% to 31%. This shift could eliminate 129 (13%) of the 983 respondent vehicle miles traveled (208 of the 1,580 respondent vehicle kilometers traveled), and 110 (36%) of the 308 times respondents parked their automobiles in the shopping district. The mode choice model of walking versus driving within survey shopping districts (N = 286) was used to test the combination of the following scenarios: 1) cluster separated stores around shared parking lots, 2) consolidate commercial driveways so that there are half as many driveway crossings along the main commercial roadway, 3) reduce all main commercial roadway speed limits to 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour), and 4) install metered parking in all shopping districts. These changes could increase the percentage of the 286 sample respondents walking between shopping district activities from 32% to 54%. This shift could eliminate 29 (38%) of the 76 respondent vehicle miles traveled (47 of the 122 respondent vehicle kilometers traveled), and 105 (22%) of the 469 times respondents parked their automobiles in the shopping district. Note that these forecasted mode shifts are illustrative examples based on cross-sectional data and do not account for the process of modifying travel behavior habits. Qualitative interviews provided a foundation for a proposed Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. This five-step theory also drew from survey results and other mode choice theories in the transportation and psychology fields. The first step, 1) awareness and availability, determines which modes are viewed as possible choices for routine travel. The next three steps, 2) basic safety and security, 3) convenience and cost, and 4) enjoyment, assess situational tradeoffs between modes in the choice set and are supported by many of the statisticallysignificant factors in the mode choice models. The final step, 5) habit, reinforces previous choices and closes the decision process loop. Socioeconomic characteristics explain differences in how individuals view each step in the process. Understanding each step in the mode choice decision process can help planners, designers, engineers, and other policy-makers implement a comprehensive set of strategies that may be able to shift routine automobile travel to pedestrian and bicycle modes.

AB  - Although the murders committed by serial killers may not be considered rational, there is growing evidence that the locations in which they commit their crimes may be guided by an implicit, if limited rationality. The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time. Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives -- crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - Objectives:This article examines to what extent repeat offenders’ crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times.Methods:Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.Results:Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime.Conclusions:Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.

AB  - This paper summarizes work from a dissertation, the main contribution of which was to develop and estimate a new empirical framework for analyzing the equilibrium outcomes of families' choices for choosing a particular residence. The principal component of the framework is a random-coefficients discrete-choice model of the residential location decision. This specification provides a form for utility, considering a household's preferences for a wide range of community features, including many that depend directly on how households sort across communities. The resulting estimates provide a complete picture of a households preferences for the location, schools, crime, environmental amenities, sociodemographic composition, housing characteristics, and price, as well as how these preferences vary with its own characteristics, including its place of work, race, education, and income. The objectives of the dissertation were to provide insight into the underlying factors that drive matching of households with their schools, thereby expanding understanding of the issue, and to expand the conceptual and empirical framework for thinking about many of the economic and social issues related to the interactions of the local public economy, education market, and urban land and labor markets.

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500 m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single‐family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour.

AB  - Burglary represents not only a violation of privacy and theft of private property; it also causes considerable fear, and this is true across the world. Unfortunately, most burglary research is conducted with data for Western countries, and there is especially little comparative research of U.S. and Asian countries, which have different social and cultural contexts. This study draws on the rational choice perspective which argues offenders who are likely to engage in rational decision making processes as they estimate the costs and benefits of committing a given crime. Two central questions guide this study: What considerations Thai offenders have when deciding whether or not to commit crime, and how they choose specific targets. This study addresses these questions using data from interviews with incarcerated residential burglars in Thailand. Data were collected primarily though semi-structured interviews with 45 Thai inmates who had been incarcerated in federal and local correctional institutions around Bangkok and vicinity, and had been convicted of residential burglary at some point in their criminal careers.Interviewees were asked about their own experiences in committing burglaries, including those in which they wanted to commit a burglary but chose not to do so as originally planned. Interviewees were asked to complete a map task to clarify the locations of their targets on a map of Bangkok City. A central focus of the study was the offenders' target selection methodology, and in the study interviewees were explicitly queried as to how they went about identified suitable residential targets for burglary. Special attention was given to the extent to which offenders utilized rational processes to select potential burglary targets, and what environmental conditions and features they used as discriminative cues in the process.Although the findings of this study should be interpreted carefully due to the relatively small sample size of the interviewees, analysis of the study data indicates that both the risks and the rewards of residential burglary influence burglars' target selection. However, when assessing potential residential burglary targets, burglars are significantly more influenced by environmental cues related to risk than by cues related to reward. Most burglars considered some burglary prevention measures such as burglary alarms, neighborhood watch, dogs, and sign of repeat victimization.Important key findings relate to cultural differences in burglars’ target selection and the decision making during the burglary process. For example, most burglars believed in fate and luck when they decided to commit burglary. Gender and age are both important factors causing differences in residential burglars’ decision making about target selection and crime commission. Based on the findings of this study, guidelines that could be useful in the development of various residential burglary prevention initiatives and measures, such as increasing more police patrol, developing job training programs inside prison, and establishing neighborhood watch programs, are put forward for consideration.

AB  -  The objectives of this research are to display the utility of using agent based model and simulated experiments in understanding criminal behavior. In particular, this research focuses upon the distance decay function that has wide applicability in understanding ways in which offenders move about their awareness space and select their targets for committing crime. The basis for distance decay is an assumption that the offender apprehends recognition by his neighbors and so tends to commit his crime a little away but not too far from his home location. But this is an untested assumption and based upon another assumption that recognition comes from frequent interactions. There is no simple way to test these assumptions in real life. This paper argues that simulated experiments using agent based modeling are appropriate methods for difficult to test criminological concepts. In this research, two types of agents are created- one representing the offender and the other- the victim. They are assigned specific characteristics that control their action such as moving in a neighborhood, making rational choice to maximize their gain while minimizing the risk of apprehension from interaction with other residents of the neighborhood. The simulation result displays that beginning with these small principles the final model emerges as a pattern of target selection similar to the distance decay function. The importance of this technique lies in the fact that such experiments provide the means to apply agent based modeling to validate a variety of criminological concepts. While the technique has limitations of validation it can help in understanding the behavior of offenders as they commit their crimes individually as well as in groups.

AB  - A synthesis of rational choice theory & sociological perspectives is developed for the analysis of institutions, combining social-structural elements with a concern for individual action to overcome the limitations of earlier, narrower theoretical approaches, published as part of the series Sociology & Economics: Controversy & Integration (Paula S. England, George Farkas, & Kevin Lang, series editors), & presented in III PARTS containing 14 Chpts, with an Introduction by the editors. PART I - ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS OF NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS - offers (1) Michael Hechter -- The Emergence of Cooperative Social Institutions -- discusses the two principle approaches to the problem of institutional creation (invisible-hand & solidaristic), argues that the latter is the better approach, & presents one particular solidaristic explanation that holds promise for future research; (2) James S. Coleman -- The Emergence of Norms -- shows that two principles can account for the emergence of norms with effective sanctions, one concerning the conditions under which a demand for norms will arise, & the other concerning the conditions under which the demand will be satisfied by effective sanctions; (3) Hartmut Kliemt -- The Costs of Organizing Social Cooperation -- argues that the creation of rules poses some difficult problems for any game-theoretically inspired political theory, identifies problems of classical political theory that modern analyses of iterated games or supergames are designed to solve & that show up again within the realm of game theory itself, & suggests that an effort to solve these problems might be of interest not only for the political theorist, but for the game theorist as well; (4) Werner Raub & Thomas Voss -- Individual Interests and Moral Institutions: An Endogenous Approach to the Modification of Preferences -- seeks to understand how self-interested individuals may also behave morally, & constructs a game-theoretic model that accounts endogenously for the emergence of morality among such individuals; (5) Karl-Dieter Opp -- The Attenuation of Customs -- deals with the conditions leading to decreased compliance to extant customs, & regards compliance to customs as the outcome of a coordination game; & (6) Rolf Ziegler -- The Kula: Social Order, Barter and Ceremonial Exchange -- attempts to provide some empirical evidence relative to the range of problems previously put forth, utilizing a game-theoretical analysis of the generalized reciprocal social relations in the South Sea Islands initially described by Bronislaw Malinowski (eg, Crime and Custom in Savage Society, London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1951 [1926]) as the Kula Ring. PART II - THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF INSTITUTIONS - includes (7) Bruno S. Frey & Werner W. Pommerehne -- A Comparative Institutional Analysis in the Arts: The Theater -- argues that decisions about the quantity & quality of theater performances, as well as about the types & methods of production, are crucially affected by the institutional constraints faced by the relevant decisionmakers; (8) Reinhard Wippler -- Cultural Resources and Participation in High Culture -- seeks to understand why schooling is such a good predictor of aesthetic & artistic interest & participation by utilizing a rational choice argument; & (9) Henk de Vos -- The Welfare State and Unemployment: A Theoretical Analysis -- uses Gary Becker's theory of social interactions (The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, Chicago & London: U of Chicago Press, 1976) to develop predictions about the consequences of long-term unemployment in two different institutional settings -- during the 1930s, & the 1980s. PART III - THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS IN A MULTIPLEX SOCIETAL CONTEXT - presents (10) Hendrik Derk Flap -- Patronage: An Institution in Its Own Right -- interprets patronage as a network phenomenon in which personal networks are conceived to represent social resources, views the emergence & maintenance of patronage as depending largely on the value of social capital, & considers the concept of social capital to be related to agency & transaction cost theories, yielding the implication that, under certain conditions, patronage relations constitute efficient solutions to contracting problems in industrial societies; (11) William Brustein -- The Political Geography of Fascist Party Membership in Germany and Italy -- provides a rational choice explanation for the rise of fascist political movements in twentieth-century Germany & Italy, & claims that regional variation in fascist party membership in these two countries can be attributed to: systematic variations in the demand for social policies advocated by the parties in these regions, differences in the opportunities available for membership, the party's store of selective incentives, & the density of local social networks; (12) Anthony Oberschall -- Incentives, Governance and Development in Chinese Collective Agriculture -- traces the effects of a series of major swings of central government policy, in the wake of the Chinese revolution, on agricultural output & development in one specific Chinese village, & attempts to explain the different fortunes of various institutional forms over a twenty-five-year period by utilizing a rational choice model in which incentives for collective output & governance costs help determine agricultural productivity & the village standard of living; (13) Debra Freidman -- Toward a Theory of Union Emergence and Demise -- accounts for patterns of the emergence & decline of US trade unions, develops a model in which unions are expected to emerge in a given industry to provide workers with insurance against high levels of contextual uncertainty, but argues that, once established, existing unions are likely to be threatened by the same kinds of contextual uncertainty that helped foster their emergence; & (14) Mary C. Brinton -- Intrafamilial Markets for Education in Japan -- explores the reasons behind institutionalized differences in the amounts of human capital found in men & women, & examines the case of Japan, constructing a rational choice model that links the institutional level with individual perceptions, motivations, & resources, thereby generating individual decisions that produce stable macrolevel outcomes. 5 Tables, 24 Figures, 17 Diagrams, 405 References.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study investigates illegal border crossings by rhino poachers into a fenced reserve in South Africa, comparing journeys to and after crime using a rational choice approach. Using various regression models, our analysis indicates poachers prefer to enter and exit the reserve near high rhino densities, while high road densities outside the reserve increase the odds of an illegal entry. The results also show that half of the incursions occurred at a single location, leading us to describe the special circumstances of this outlier. The study lays a foundation for understanding the location choices poachers make and presents a methodology that can be replicated in other reserves.

AB  - The present article examines the key concepts underlying victimization theories (i.e., exposure, proximity, target attractiveness, guardianship). Measures of each concept are developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to explain individuals' risks of residential burglary, personal theft, and personal violence. Using data from 5,271 respondents in the British Crime Survey, mixed empirical support is found for the structural-choice model underlying current victimization theories. Specifically, the structural components of these theories (proximity and exposure) are more consistently related to victimization experiences than the target-selection or choice components (attractiveness and guardianship). Multiplicative models that test for interaction among these major variables also produce results that are contrary to theoretical productions. The authors conclude that present theories do not adequately describe individuals' risks of victimization and discuss some alternative directions for future research on criminal victimization.

AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers’ crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers’ crime location choices, but not native robbers’. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  -  In the context of the epistemological and methodological debates about rational choice (RC) sparked by Green and Shapiro and the subsequent rejoinders, Hindmoor made the theoretical claim that there is now an opportunity for RC to be enhanced and for past debates to be set aside by incorporating different theoretical perspectives into RC. This article presents an example of one context in which this can be done: the study of illegal private protection (IPP) produced by organised criminals and corrupt officials. It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC). Both positive and negative forms and effects of SC are considered. This approach highlights a middle ground between advocates and critics of RC, demonstrating a capacity to explain patterns in the production of IPP between organisations and across countries.

AB  - A hybrid conditional logit choice model is estimated using data on the characteristics and destination of homeowners who engaged in intrametropolitan moves among 17, school districts within the Columbus, Ohio area in 1995. The model is used to test the relative influence of local fiscal and public goods versus household-level characteristics in determining household location choices across central city and suburban school districts. Results provide evidence of both a 'natural evolution' of households to the suburbs, due to job location, residential filtering, and household income and lifecycle effects, and 'flight from blight,' due to lower school quality, higher crime levels, and lower average income levels in the city. In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that school quality exerts the strongest influence: a 1-percent increase in the school quality of the city district increases the probability of choosing a city residence by 3.7 percent. In contrast, the effects of household income and other individual characteristics are relatively modest. The findings provide support for a 'flight from blight' suburbanization process that is dominated by differences in neighborhood quality between the city and suburbs. An implication is that investments that promote central city development and reduce suburbanization are justified on efficiency grounds if negative externalities are generated by increased concentration of poverty, crime, and low school quality.

AB  - This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions. Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments. In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions. While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.

AB  - Purpose Although rational choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, there is a lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of 'forensic awareness' as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use. Methods Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada. Results Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness. Conclusion Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene.

AB  - Technological evolutions and burglary target selection: a study on the use of Google Maps and Google Street ViewTechnological progress has a great impact on the lives of many citizens. The increasing amount of available information may however be used by criminals too, for example by burglars in their search for a suitable target. Applying the rational choice perspective and by means of an experiment with students, this paper first investigates whether it is likely or not that tools such as Google Maps and Google Street View are used for burglary. Furthermore, we investigate whether the considered target characteristics differ when such tools are used. The results indicate that we cannot give an affirmative answer to these questions so far.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail -- crime pattern and social disorganization theory -- and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

AB  - This dissertation consists of three studies which analyze different aspects of risky behaviors and criminal participation. A longstanding question is whether alcohol and marijuana use by teenagers exerts a "stepping stone" effect, increasing the chances that they will use harder drugs in the future. Empirically, teenagers who use alcohol or marijuana in one period are more likely to use cocaine in the future. This pattern can be explained in one of two ways: by a causal effect of soft drug consumption on future consumption of hard drugs (i.e., a true stepping-stone effect) or by unobserved characteristics that make people more likely to use soft drugs at a relatively young age, and hard drugs at a later age (i.e., correlated unobserved heterogeneity). Distinguishing between these alternatives is highly policy relevant because, to the extent that there is a true stepping stone effect, policies that reduce the use of soft drugs by young people will have lasting impact on the use of hard drugs by adults. In Chapter 1, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) to estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of teenager's use of alcohol, marijuana and cocaine over multiple years, and separately identify the contributions of state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. I find modest-sized but statistically significant "stepping-stone" effects from softer to harder drugs that are largest among the youngest individuals in my sample. In contrast, I find little evidence of a stepping stone effect from cocaine to alcohol or marijuana. Simulations show that restricting alcohol and marijuana use at young age has a modest impact on reducing later cocaine use. Chapter 2 examines the role of an increase in alcohol consumption on drug initiation, hard drug consumption, and criminal participation. Using a regression discontinuity research design, I exploit the discontinuous increase in alcohol consumption at age 21 provided by the minimum legal drinking age. Using a survey of respondents during the year after they turned 21, I found that the probability of cocaine initiation decreased by 1.5 percentage points and the share of respondents who consumed cocaine in the last year decreased by 2 percentage points. Self-reported criminal participation, such as drug dealing, property destruction and attacking an individual, remained unchanged at age 21, with the exception of stealing, which decreased by 3 percentage points. These estimates are robust to a variety of specifications. Between 1993 and 1995, a number of states implemented "Three Strikes and You're Out" laws that enhance the sentence length for repeat violent offenders. Chapter 3 develops a simple dynamic model that suggests that these laws will lead to an increase in the number of criminal cases that go to trial, rather than being settled with a plea bargain, since the threat of higher future sentences increases the cost of a being convicted for a strikeable offense. I use data from the 1990-2006 State Court Processing Statistics database and a state-by-year difference-in-differences research design to compare the change in the likelihood of plea bargaining by violent offenders after the passage of Three Strikes laws, relative to the trend among non-violent offenders. I also separately examine effects for offenders with at least one prior violent conviction, and compare the effects of the Three Strike law in California, which imposes extra sentencing for any third felony (violent or not), versus the eleven other states with Three Strikes laws. The results show that the introduction of Three Strikes laws significantly reduce the number of criminal cases that are settle with a plea bargain, imposing a potentially costly burden on the legal system.

AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense? Do they rob close to home? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets? What keeps them away from certain areas? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996--1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction.

AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

AB  - Although rational choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, there is a lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of "forensic awareness" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use. Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada. Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness. Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders’ crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders’ homes, family members’ homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.

AB  - Motor vehicle theft costs the United States billions of dollars each year in direct and indirect losses. More specifically, vehicle theft in areas near borders and ports has been cited as a significant growing problem in both academic studies and media reports. Although no reliable measure of international vehicle theft exists, the National Insurance Crime Bureau and other agencies acknowledge that a disproportionate number of vehicles are stolen in cities and towns near borders and ports. Yet, with few exceptions, research studies have not focused on vehicle theft in these high-risk areas. This dissertation utilizes incident-level data from a U.S.-Mexico border area city (Chula Vista, California) and a U.S. port area city (Newark, New Jersey) to investigate vehicle theft patterns related to exporting in the two locations. Two separate analyses were conducted using recovery status and recovery country as dependent variables in logistic regression models. Predictor variables were constructed based on previous research findings and expectations from a rational choice framework. In the multivariate comparison between unrecovered vehicles and recovered vehicles in both sites, few significant predictors emerged. Overall, there were more statistically significant predictors in Chula Vista than in Newark. Specifically, in Chula Vista, unrecovered vehicle thefts are more likely to be larger vehicle types. In a second analysis, vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered in Mexico were compared to a random sample of vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered domestically. Vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered in Mexico are significantly younger and more expensive than vehicles recovered in the U.S. Additionally, sports utility vehicles and pick-up trucks are more likely to be taken to Mexico, while 2-door cars are more likely to be recovered domestically. The current study provides partial support for a link between rational choice perspective’s focus on increasing rewards and professional vehicle theft in Mexico. It appears that less consideration is given to reducing effort and risk by professional thieves in these areas in comparison to amateur thieves. From a policy standpoint, this study indicates that prevention efforts should target certain vehicles in border cities and focus less on space and time.

AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-to-crime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press

AB  - Since the classical studies of Guerry (1831) & Quetelet (1842), it has been well-documented that crime occurrence rates vary for different regions, cities, neighborhoods, & targets. Research on these spatial variations in crime occurrence has had considerable influence on criminological theory, & has been the basis for crime prevention policies, eg, intensified police patrolling, target hardening, & community programs. Here, traditional research on urban crime patterns is reconsidered from a rational choice perspective, arguing that traditional approaches, (eg, the ecological & situational) have failed to adequately explain spatial variations in crime occurrence. This is attributed to the fact that these approaches generally lack a sound microfoundation of the macro-phenomena to be explained. An alternative approach is proposed, based on methodological individualism & rational choice, & its qualities & limitations are discussed.

AB  - Although the study of both offense processes and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender's decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as "irrational" and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders. Implications of the results are briefly discussed in regard of clinical practice and crime prevention.

AB  - Housing purchase represents one of a household's most significant economic decisions. The ancient joke in real estate is that the three most important criteria for selecting a house are location, location, and location. This explains the great emphasis of a household on residential location choice when he/she is buying a home. Driven by households' demand on location, it should also play an important role in determining house prices. As a key determinant in household consumption behavior, locational context or neighborhood effects is worth investigation. This dissertation examines locational/neighborhood effects in the housing market using spatial econometric methods. The first essay studies the importance of social interactions in a household's location decision. I argue that individuals prefer interacting with others who have similar socioeconomic backgrounds. The hypothesis that a household desires to find a good community match is tested through the application of a discrete residential location choice model. An unwritten rule in real estate is that one should buy the cheapest house in an expensive neighborhood, which is formally the Tiebout hypothesis that households search for a community where their benefits from local public goods will exceed their local tax costs. The community matching hypothesis and the Tiebout hypothesis have different implications regarding a household's residential location choice. Community matching implies households will prefer similarity, while the Tiebout hypothesis implies households will prefer neighborhoods with richer neighbors. I use a nested logit (NL) regression to analyze a household's residential community decision within Franklin County, OH. As an important input of the NL regression, a set of housing price indices are created through a spatial error model. The regression results support the hypothesis that a household prefers neighbors with like socioeconomic characteristics in almost all of the similarity dimensions and only prefers an affluent neighborhood to a moderate degree. The second essay employs a spatial autoregressive model (SAR) to estimate housing asset prices. Applying the rational expectations hypothesis, this essay models the current value of a housing unit as the conditional expectation of the discounted stream of housing services accruing to the owner of the house. Based on the importance of location, the value of housing services is determined by neighborhood effects as well as the physical attributes of the property itself. In the existing hedonic literature, the neighborhood effects are only ascribed to prior transactions in the neighborhood. After employing the generalized method of moments (GMM) in estimating the spatial asset pricing model, I find that both expected future transactions and prior transactions in the neighborhood are significant in explaining a house's price, and the explanation power of future neighborhood transactions is statistically equivalent to that of past neighborhood transactions. The inclusion of expected future transaction prices in the neighborhood takes into account the influence of expected changes in the community and factors these potential changes into the house prices. This is consistent with the forward-looking behavior of households. The forward-looking model generates superior out-of-sample prediction performance relative to the conventional hedonic model.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. Reprinted by permission of Springer

AB  - The current study examines mass public shooters who target government agents and institutions in the United States. This research uses a rational choice perspective to examine the incidence, motivations, and target selection. Additionally, this work provides an in-depth investigation of ideological attacks, as well as a comparison against general mass public shooting perpetrator, planning, and incident characteristics. Results indicate non-ideological attacks against government targets occur more than ideologically motivated shootings. Importantly, the majority of ideologically motivated mass public shooters do not attack government targets. These findings provide implications for security, policy, and prevention strategies that have historically focused on ideologically motivated mass public shootings against government targets.

AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate a model of household residential location decisions. In particular, this research focuses on determining the relative importance of space itself vs. neighborhood characteristics that happen to be spatially distributed. Distinguishing between these two influences of space in household location decisions is important because they have different implications for the evolution of urban form. To investigate these questions, this research develops and estimates several discrete choice models of household location using a unique data set on repeated home buyers in 1998 within Franklin County, Ohio. A distinguishing feature of this research is the explicit consideration of the spatial dimension of intra-metropolitan location decisions within a discrete choice framework. This study considers different sources of error dependency and attempts to correct for them using data in which the spatial error component has been removed via a spatial filtering technique. The empirical results demonstrate the importance of addressing the spatial dependency problem. In comparing the results from a naive model with those from the spatially filtered models, spatial dependency is found to be a serious problem and estimation without controlling it gives inconsistent as well as inefficient parameter estimates. Results show that a number of expected variables influence household location decisions, including public school quality, crime rate, unemployment rate, population density, age of housing stock, and socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhood residents, such as percentage of African-American population, median income, percentage of college graduates and owner occupied housing. The empirical results show that the spatial location of a neighborhood relative to the quality of neighborhoods surrounding it matters. Therefore, a neighborhood's location in space matters beyond its relative distance to employment and other destinations. On the other hand, while moves to some inner and outer suburbs exhibit a distance bias, the general finding is that moves to the outer suburbs do not appear to be constrained by either distance or geographic sector. We conclude that it is the spatial distribution of neighborhood characteristics, including the spatial location of neighborhoods relative to each other, that drive household location decisions.

AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-to-crime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted.

AB  - This thesis is based on an evaluation of 1,060 cases of residential burglary in Macao in the years 2001, 2002 and 2003. Using official data sources supplemented by interviews, self-reported measures and on-site observations, the analyses are aimed to see if the rational choice perspective can be used to explain the situation of residential burglary in Macao, thereby acquiring more background information concerning such criminal act. Such study makes use of the distribution pattern of hotspots for residential burglary, the time of the offence, the characteristics of the victims particularly their lifestyles and the characteristics of the dwellings within the neighbourhoods that are prone to such criminal act. Research findings reveal that the rational choice perspective provides an analytical tool to understanding certain aspects of residential burglary in Macao. The relevance of this perspective comes into play when burglars in Macao appear to make rational choice when selecting their offence locations as well as targets. For instance, burglars in Macao tend to choose (i) neighbourhoods that are closer to their home base; (ii) buildings that are comparatively vulnerable and within reach; (iii) buildings that are near to ground-level stores that facilitate their target selection processes; (iv) dwellings that are left unoccupied and are less visible to neighbours and passers by and (v) time period that secures the absence of capable guardians (such as 12:01-18:00) if not the vulnerability of them (03:01-06:00). Whatever the degree of rationality, however, research findings also reveal that the rational choice perspective is limited to the extent that it cannot explain certain features in Macao. For instance, the perspective fails to explain why it is not necessary, in the situation of Macao, to ensure the presence of suitable targets existing all at once, why higher population density, higher neighbourhood's average income, higher transient population and higher individual's confinement to their routine daily activities do not bring about higher burglary rate in certain neighbourhoods. Indeed, the limitations of the rational choice perspective is owed, to a large extent, to the fact that the perspective is derived from Western studies and that Macao has its own unique geographical settings as well as cultural background that are seen to play a vital role in the determination of such distinctive pattern of residential burglary. Hence, although this research serves to flesh out the use of the rational choice perspective in assessing the validity of the choice criteria for residential burglary, it implores that other theoretical perspectives like the social disorganisation theory, the routine activity and situational opportunity theories be used should the rational choice perspective be taken further. In addition, the discrepancy thus put forward suggests that crime prevention strategies should be divided into location-focused, dwelling-focused, victim-focused and offender-focused interventions in order to improve the current measures against residential burglary in Macao.

AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders’ knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders’ pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members’ home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge—where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities—and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders’ crime location choices.

AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

AB  - In the context of the epistemological and methodological debates about rational choice (RC) sparked by Green and Shapiro and the subsequent rejoinders, Hindmoor made the theoretical claim that there is now an opportunity for RC to be enhanced and for past debates to be set aside by incorporating different theoretical perspectives into RC. This article presents an example of one context in which this can be done: the study of illegal private protection (IPP) produced by organised criminals and corrupt officials. It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC). Both positive and negative forms and effects of SC are considered. This approach highlights a middle ground between advocates and critics of RC, demonstrating a capacity to explain patterns in the production of IPP between organisations and across countries.

AB  - Problem definition: This paper studies pricing and assortment management for cross-category products, a common practice in brick-and-mortar retailing and e-tailing. Academic/practical relevance: We investigate the complementarity effects between the main products and the secondary products, in addition to the substitution effects for products in the same category. Methodology: In this paper, we develop a multistage sequential choice model, under which a consumer first chooses a main product and then selects a secondary product. The new model can alleviate the restriction of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property and allows more flexible substitution patterns and also takes into account complementarity effects. Results: We characterize the impact of the magnitude of complementarity effects on pricing and assortment management. For the problems that are hard to solve optimally, we propose simple heuristics and establish performance guarantee. In addition, we develop easy-to-implement estimation algorithms to calibrate the proposed sequential choice model by using sales data. Managerial implications: We show that ignoring or mis-specifying complementarity effects may lead to substantial losses. The methodologies on modeling, optimization, and estimation have potential to make an impact on cross-category retailing management.

AB  - A hybrid conditional logit choice model is estimated using data on the characteristics and destination of homeowners who engaged in intrametropolitan moves among 17 school districts within the Columbus, Ohio area in 1995. The model is used to test the relative influence of local fiscal and public goods versus household-level characteristics in determining household location choices across central city and suburban school districts. Results provide evidence of both a "natural evolution" of households to the suburbs, due to job location, residential filtering, and household income and lifecycle effects, and "flight from blight," due to lower school quality, higher crime levels, and lower average income levels in the city. In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that school quality exerts the strongest influence: a 1-percent increase in the school quality of the city district increases the probability of choosing a city residence by 3.7 percent. In contrast, the effects of household income and other individual characteristics are relatively modest. The findings provide support for a "flight from blight" suburbanization process that is dominated by differences in neighborhood quality between the city and suburbs. An implication is that investments that promote central city development and reduce suburbanization are justified on efficiency grounds if negative externalities are generated by increased concentration of poverty, crime, and low school quality.

AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevail - crime pattern and social disorganization theory - and consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

AB  - Society's efforts to deter crime with punishment may be ineffective because those individuals most prone to commit crime often act impulsively, with little thought for the future, and so they may be unmoved by the threat of later punishment. Deterrence messages they receive, therefore, may fall on deaf ears. This article examines this issue by testing the relationship between criminal propensity, perceived risks and costs of punishment, and criminal behavior. The authors analyzed data from the Dunedin (New Zealand) Study, a longitudinal study of individuals from birth through age 26 (N = 1,002). They found that in fact, deterrence perceptions had their greatest impact on criminally prone study members. (Contains 4 tables, 4 figures, and 13 notes.)

AB  - ObjectivesWe aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences.MethodsThe data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services.ResultsThe results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders.ConclusionsBy replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.

AB  - Recent case law and social science both have claimed that the developmental limitations of adolescents affect their capacity for control and decision making with respect to crime, diminishing their culpability and reducing their exposure to punishment. Social science has focused on two concurrent adolescent developmental influences: the internalization of legal rules and norms that regulate social and antisocial behaviors, and the development of rationality to frame behavioral choices and decisions. The interaction of these two developmental processes, and the identification of one domain of socialization and development as the primary source of motivation or restraint in adolescence, is the focus of this article. Accordingly, we combine rational choice and legal socialization frameworks into an integrated, developmental model of criminality. We test this framework in a large sample of adolescent felony offenders who have been interviewed at six-month intervals for two years. Using hierarchical and growth curve models, we show that both legal socialization and rational choice factors influence patterns of criminal offending over time. When punishment risks and costs are salient, crime rates are lower over time. We show that procedural justice is a significant antecedent of legal socialization, but not of rational choice. We also show that both mental health and developmental maturity moderate the effects of perceived crime risks and costs on criminal offending.

AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour.

AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection.

AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives - crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - Using a unique dataset on the characteristics, origin, and destination of households who engaged in intrametropolitan moves in the Columbus, Ohio area, we estimate a hybrid conditional logit choice model of residential location that separately identifies the push/pull influence of local public goods, namely school quality and public safety, from household income and other lifecycle effects. Our results provide evidence of both a "natural evolution" of households, due to income and household structural changes, as well as a "flight from blight", due to higher crime rates, lower school quality, and lower quality of housing stock in the central city. In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that the influence of public school quality is consistently larger than the influence of household income across all locations and particularly in the central city. Rather than being largely a result of the "natural evolution" of households as incomes grow over time, our results provide evidence that the central city's inferior public goods, most notably school quality, have played a much more dominant role in pushing households to suburban locations. This finding has important implications for central city, suburban, and exurban communities that seek to counteract the movement of population to the outer suburbs and beyond.

AB  - AbstractPrevious research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined political influences on communities' allocations of fiscal and personnel resources to policing. Rational choice theory maintains that these resources are distributed in accordance with the need for crime control, whereas conflict theory argues that they are allocated with the aim of controlling racial and ethnic minorities. Existing research more consistently supports the conflict argument, but important issues remain unaddressed. The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective. Class divisions within the Hispanic community may explain this pattern of findings.

Different tie strengths, such as acquaintances, friends, and family members, influence the construction and reconstruction of the operation team. Understanding the interaction patterns of tie strength might be useful not only for advancing our understanding of terror operations, but ultimately for providing more effective methods of countering terrorist violence. To this end, in this paper, we designed an operation-related social network, and analyzed the tie strength selection and cooperative reconnection in the terror operation networks. We proposed three hypotheses about the tie strengths and had the Al-Qaeda dataset investigated to test the hypotheses. Results demonstrate that the terrorist organization has some different interaction patterns against the ordinary social organizations and the terror operations share similar features with crime events in rational choice. Our analysis reveals that tie strength matters in terror operations and is essentially helpful in making counterterrorism strategies.

AB  - Objectives: To test whether there is a relationship between characteristics of the journey to an outdoor cannabis cultivation site and the total number of plants grown. Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: prime, rugged, dry, and remote. Prime sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying "prime" locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes.

AB  - This article discusses a specific crime -- assault -- usually registered in domicile victimization surveys, as compared to stealing and robberies. It debates whether rational choice theory is suitable to understand crimes as registered in these surveys. As far as assault is concerned, this theory is unable to explain the association between social context and victimization risk, markedly different for women and men, as well as more linked to power and recognition than to material gains or assets. Furthermore, the differences between feminine and masculine patterns of victimization by assault could not be interpreted only by the commonly used theory of the patriarchal family, and should be illuminated by recent changes in urban life, family patterns and in the construction of masculine identities and practices, as suggested by the theories of hyper masculinity or warrior ethos. This may be useful for changing public policies aiming prevention of violence in interpersonal relationships. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - Despite the intense and prolonged public attention received when a child is abducted and killed, there are major gaps in the academic literature. One of the gaps pertains to the distances traveled by the offender between key crime locations. The overall aim of this study was to provide information concerning typical travel distances of offenders. This project utilized an archival data set compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The database constructed for this project consisted of 72 victims who were abducted and murdered by 68 offenders. The date range for these offenses was 1970–2006. The research questions were addressed with t-tests for independent samples and multiple linear regressions. Three primary dependent variables under investigation in this study were (a) the distance between the offender's residence and the abduction site, (b) the distance between the abduction site and the disposal of the victim's remains, (c) the distance between the location of the body disposal site and the offender's residence. Additionally, a multitude of bivariate analyses were examined. The variables examined in various combinations using bivariate analyses were offender characteristics, victim characteristics, distance variables, and crime event variables.  Although findings were primarily insignificant, they contribute to the general literature regarding child abduction homicide offenses. While a number of studies have related child abduction/homicide to specific contexts, little research has been done relating child abduction to theoretical frameworks. This study explored routine activities theory, rational choice theory, and crime pattern theory as they relate to the geographical behavior of child abductors/murderers.

AB  - An estimated 200,000 juveniles are tried as adults yearly and receive punitive sentences intended to deter juvenile crime and increase public safety. Few qualitative studies on juveniles sentenced as adults and contradictory results indicate a need for further research. This study used a qualitative, phenomenological interpretive design, with the conceptual frameworks of general and specific deterrence and rational choice theories. In-depth interviews took place with 12 incarcerated adults serving sentences (24–540 months) for juvenile crimes. The research questions explored their knowledge of transfer laws and adult sentencing and perceptions of deterrence from future criminal activity. Coding of transcripts and audio files was distilled into meaning units following the hermeneutical tradition, and triangulation was used to identify overarching themes and patterns. Findings revealed that no participants understood application of transfer to adult court to them, and 10 (83%) revealed ignorance of juvenile transfer laws. Thus, they did not weigh costs or benefits prior to offending (general deterrence) or exercise rational decision making; however, 11 (92%) would have reconsidered offending if they were aware of adult sentences. Half admitted the impacts of incarceration would not deter them from future offending (no specific deterrence), and half believed negative factors would prevent recidivism. Study results can prompt further research in juvenile offenders’ knowledge and decisions regarding adult sentencing. Implications for social change include dissemination of findings to deter adolescents from criminal behavior. Findings may also aid policymakers’ reevaluation and revision of sentencing policies for juvenile offenders to help prevent juvenile crime and recidivism and increase public safety.

AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the US District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

AB  - Informal social control at micro-level places such as addresses, collections of addresses, and streetblocks is a critical factor in understanding crime patterns. Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing 'eyes on the street' and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events. The article explains each theory, discusses the spatial scale at which the dynamics operate, highlights gaps in the current body of knowledge, and proposes a two-pronged research path forward.

AB  - Coal miners’ struggles with black lung disease can be traced to the 1800s. Back then, coal miners fought to make the industry accept that coal mine dust was the culprit behind black lung disease, but they failed. By 1900, some clinicians started recognizing that coal miners suffered from anthracosis or asthma. The miners realized that they could accomplish more if they worked as a team and formed the United Mine Workers of America. They attempted to get compensation for disabled coal miners but failed repeatedly. Their hard work gradually brought about change with the passage of the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act which allowed the government to inspect coal mines, establish safety coal-dust level policies, and compensate sick coal miners. Gaining black lung disease benefits was not as easy as expected. Despite several thousand coal miners applying for black lung disease benefits, only a few thousand received them since the coal companies would mostly appeal benefit award claims for decades until the coal miner and/or his wife gave up or died. After the act was passed, there was a decrease in black lung disease cases until 2000, when the number started to rise again, especially among young coal miners.Many scholars have been looking for an explanation for the sudden increase in black lung disease cases since 2000. Some theorize that the increase was caused by coal mining companies cutting corners and not maintaining safe coal dust levels; the true extent of the problem was unknown because all coal miners do not test themselves for black lung disease. This research uses rational choice theory to analyze the decisions of key players, such as the federal government (Congress and the President), coal miners, black lung disease medical experts, coal mine operators/owners, and appellate courts, to identify patterns in the way their decisions impacted the US Department of Labor’s ability to implement the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act (Policy) and the amendments added years later and also determine whether the federal government has properly implemented coal mining safety and health policies in the coal mining industry. The researcher would consider coal mine explosion investigations, criminal and/or civil cases related to coal mine explosions, violations to Environmental Protection Agency policies, and attempts by coal miners, and watchdog and coal mining organizations to obtain monetary damages and/or a judicial order to stop the federal government from issuing a coal mining permit or stop implementing the policies for coal mining federal agencies such as the MSHA. Coal mine explosion investigations and criminal/civil cases began in 2000 and has continued since then. The literature review suggests that the black lung cases among coal miners first noticeably rose in the mid 1990s. This research will answer the following questions:1.	How are the major findings of the mine explosions reports, criminal cases, and civil cases related to the administration of justice?2.	How are the major findings from the mine explosions reports, criminal cases, and civil cases related to the administration of black lung disease benefits?3.	How do the actions of key players (state and federal legislators, coal mining operators/owners, coal miners, and the federal government and federal agencies) possible hinder the US Department of Labor’s ability to implement the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act (Policy) and its later amendments? How can it be determined whether the federal government has properly implemented coal mining safety and health policies in the coal mining industry?

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available." Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Inc.

AB  - Recently, severe haze pollution has not only threatened human health and food security, but also seems to have aggravated the unscientific use of pesticides by rice farmers in rural areas of China. Using original data on haze pollution across China, combined with rural household survey data collected from 2014 to 2018, we conducted a detailed empirical study on the effects of haze pollution on pesticide use by rice farmers based on the theory of risk aversion. The empirical results revealed that haze pollution with higher levels of PM2.5 positively impacted the use of chemical pesticides in rice cultivation. More precisely, with each 100% increase in PM2.5 concentrations, the use of pesticide per mu increased by 7.9%, and the average pesticide cost per mu increased by 2.3%. The results were robust to a series of tests that addressed potential endogeneity concerns, including omitted variable bias, measurement error, and reverse causality. We then examined the heterogeneous effects of haze pollution increases on the use of chemical pesticides and found that for rice farmers without rice insurance, haze pollution has a stronger effect on pesticide use and a weaker effect on pesticide cost. However, for rice farmers with more experience in rice cultivation and small-scale rice planting, the effect of haze pollution on pesticide use and cost is relatively small. Our findings provide important policy implications for pesticide risk management in rural areas of developing countries.

AB  - This study explores rural U.S. crime patterns with a focus on social capital. We use a triangulation of three core theories of crime including social disorganization, anomie/strain, and rational choice theories to develop a formal theory and an empirical framework. The role of four unique measures of social capital is explored in understanding patterns of rural crime using nonmetropolitan U.S. county data. The empirical results generally support the theoretical predictions and conclude that rural communities that pursue economic growth and development must be prepared to address the resulting upward pressures on crime. The results on social capital and crime provide numerous policy insights for rural communities. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

AB  -  ECONOMISTS HAVE LONG been famous (or notorious) for plunging into such  seemingly non-economic topics as crime or marriage. Beginning in the 1960s,  University of Chicago economist Gary S. Becker brought economic theory to bear  on family life, discrimination, education, and addiction, arguing that  incentives, rational choices, and competitive pressures shape all sorts of  behavior. He got a Nobel Prize for his efforts. More recently,  "Freakonomics" coauthor Steven D. Levitt, another University of Chicago  economist, has earned a place on the best-seller list by popularizing his more  empirical work on such sociological topics as the structure of crack gangs and  the spread of popular baby names. Levitt says he's "enthralled by the tools of  economics, but never by the questions." While economists continue to probe into social life, a growing academic  subfield known as economic sociology is doing just the opposite-bringing tools  and concepts from sociology to bear on the economy. We cannot understand how  people earn, spend, and invest their money, economic sociologists argue,  unless we understand social relations. If, as economists contend, incentives  and choice are everywhere, so are social conventions and personal connections. "The economy is social. It's a set of social relations. The economy is as  social as a family or religion," says Viviana A. Zelizer, a Princeton  University sociologist who studies how cultural attitudes and consumption  patterns influence each other. A leading figure in economic sociology, Zelizer is sharply critical of the  dichotomy she calls "hostile worlds," which juxtaposes "a world of  rationality, efficiency, and impersonality, on one side" with "a world of  self-expression, cultural richness, and intimacy on the other-with contact  between the two worlds inevitably corrupting both of them." Real human beings,  she argues, don't divide their rational and emotional, or personal and  commercial, lives that way. So, contrary to both the simplified models of some economists and the  anti-commercial zeal of many social critics, she and other economic  sociologists argue that the marketplace and social relations aren't separate  spheres. They're completely entangled. Consider the homeowner who is remodeling his kitchen and hires his  secretary's nephew as a contractor, or the startup company in a major city  that gets a loan from a tiny bank hundreds of miles away in the founder's  rural hometown. From hiring to investment, our economic decisions are shaped  not just by financial interests but by relationships, history, and emotional  bonds. . . . In some ways, economic sociology is as old as sociology itself, dating back  to Max Weber, Karl Marx, and Emile Durkheim. Until recently, however, modern  sociologists who ventured into economic topics usually stuck to peripheral  areas like work and family life or non- financial motivations for work. Over the past decade, economic sociologists have instead gone to "the heart  of the capitalist enterprise-firms and markets," says Richard Swedberg, a  Cornell sociologist and the coeditor of "The Handbook of Economic Sociology,"  first published in 1994. (A significantly revised second edition, with  articles on topics ranging from the sociology of money and credit to the  ethnic economy, was recently published by Princeton University Press.) Most sociology departments now offer courses in economic sociology, which  were nearly unheard of 10 or 15 years ago. Business schools are snapping up  Ph.D.s, offering salaries twice those of sociology departments. Adventurous economists are starting to pay attention. The Winter 2005 issue  of Journal of Economic Perspectives led with a special section of four  articles on economic sociology. In the introduction, Robert Gibbons, an  economist at MIT's Sloan School of Management, argues that economic sociology  offers new variables for economists to include in their own models of  organizations and markets.

AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. In addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements - the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention - to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The current study investigates body disposal patterns in sexual homicide and examines whether offender’s behavior differ between solved and unsolved cases. To address these two research questions in line with rational choice perspective, a series of logistic regression analyses was conducted on a sample of 250 solved, and 100 unsolved sexual homicide cases in Canada. Within solved cases, results show that if victim is a prostitute, body found concealed, and found lying face down, it is likely the body was moved. For unsolved cases, the role of victim as a prostitute, and body recovered outdoors suggest that the body was moved. Further, results indicate that post-crime phase factors predicted the most whether the victim’s body was moved in solved cases. Whereas within unsolved cases, crime-phase factors contributed the most at predicting whether the body was moved post-homicide. Theoretical and practical implications from this study are discussed.

AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world. Reprinted by permission of Springer

AB  - The incidence of armed banditry has exacerbated the security conundrum in Nigeria to create a multidimensional security quandary. Meanwhile, the extant studies on the matter offer insubstantial theoretical explanations. This study attempts an extensive approach that captures the necessitating factors for banditry from an opportunistic standpoint. This is heralded on the presupposition that crime occurs as a result of the opportunities presented to carry it out. Therefore, this study adopts the theories of crime opportunities, such as routine activity theory, rational choice and crime pattern to expound on the incidence of armed banditry in Nigeria. It was found out that opportunities play a role in banditry; the phenomenon is concentrated in time and space; the opportunities for the menace is highly specific and that the incidence produces opportunities for other crimes. Solutions rooted in the theoretical proposition of situational crime prevention and crime prevention through environmental design theories are thence proffered.

AB  - Informal social control at micro-level places such as addresses, collections of addresses, and streetblocks is a critical factor in understanding crime patterns. Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing "eyes on the street" and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events. The article explains each theory, discusses the spatial scale at which the dynamics operate, highlights gaps in the current body of knowledge, and proposes a two-pronged research path forward.

AB  - Since the last decade of the twentieth century, several authors have claimed that the contemporary and 'new' developments in (private) policing and crime control form part of the process of neo-liberal policies and rational choice approaches to crime. However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned.

AB  - The following dissertation explored the criminological phenomenon of home-invasion robbery by investigating the behavioral characteristics associated to perpetration. The problem considered pertained to the behavioral patterns of perpetration related to crime commission that is unknown to practitioners and law enforcement professionals. Recent studies have examined home-invasion victimization and environmental methods implemented to prevent victimization; unfortunately, little empirical research exists on the behavioral patterns of home-invasion perpetration. This study was performed to enhance and examine what was currently known about home-invasion robbery. The researcher collected and assessed approximately 20 case files of home-invasion robbery obtained from a large metropolitan police department in the southern region of the United States. Rational choice theory was integrated into the theoretical framework and recapitulated in the literature review. The literature review expounded upon aspects associated to home-invasion victimization, perpetration characteristics, the need for further research pertaining to home-invasion robbery, and the application of environmental criminology as an additional method of assessing perpetration patterns of offenders. The empirical study conducted was qualitative, with the purpose of verifying the existence of perpetration patterns of home-invasion robbery and to determine if a collective set of patterns exists among them. The researcher was able to establish a baseline for home-invasion offender typologies to include: (a) Emulator, (b) Monetarist, (c) Associate, (d) Tyrant, and (e) Consumer. Furthermore, the researcher established a set of baseline classifications of entry to include: (a) Enticer, (b) Intimidator, (c) Predator, and (d) Opportunist.

AB  - An estimated 200,000 juveniles are tried as adults yearly and receive punitive sentences intended to deter juvenile crime and increase public safety. Few qualitative studies on juveniles sentenced as adults and contradictory results indicate a need for further research. This study used a qualitative, phenomenological interpretive design, with the conceptual frameworks of general and specific deterrence and rational choice theories. In-depth interviews took place with 12 incarcerated adults serving sentences (24-540 months) for juvenile crimes. The research questions explored their knowledge of transfer laws and adult sentencing and perceptions of deterrence from future criminal activity. Coding of transcripts and audio files was distilled into meaning units following the hermeneutical tradition, and triangulation was used to identify overarching themes and patterns. Findings revealed that no participants understood application of transfer to adult court to them, and 10 (83%) revealed ignorance of juvenile transfer laws. Thus, they did not weigh costs or benefits prior to offending (general deterrence) or exercise rational decision making; however, 11 (92%) would have reconsidered offending if they were aware of adult sentences. Half admitted the impacts of incarceration would not deter them from future offending (no specific deterrence), and half believed negative factors would prevent recidivism. Study results can prompt further research in juvenile offenders' knowledge and decisions regarding adult sentencing. Implications for social change include dissemination of findings to deter adolescents from criminal behavior. Findings may also aid policymakers' reevaluation and revision of sentencing policies for juvenile offenders to help prevent juvenile crime and recidivism and increase public safety.

AB  - The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Research into offender mobility has shown that, generally speaking, most offenders commit crimes in the vicinity of their homes. Several approaches can be taken to explain such behavior, including rational choice of perspective which states that offenders weigh their costs and benefits, and offender's awareness space which refers to all spaces of which an offender has knowledge. Here, Van Daele and Vander Beken address how the crime patterns of mobile offenders are shaped by their awareness space.

AB  - Motor vehicle theft costs the United States billions of dollars each year in direct and indirect losses. More specifically, vehicle theft in areas near borders and ports has been cited as a significant growing problem in both academic studies and media reports. Although no reliable measure of international vehicle theft exists, the National Insurance Crime Bureau and other agencies acknowledge that a disproportionate number of vehicles are stolen in cities and towns near borders and ports. Yet, with few exceptions, research studies have not focused on vehicle theft in these high-risk areas. This dissertation utilizes incident-level data from a U.S.-Mexico border area city (Chula Vista, California) and a U.S. port area city (Newark, New Jersey) to investigate vehicle theft patterns related to exporting in the two locations. Two separate analyses were conducted using recovery status and recovery country as dependent variables in logistic regression models. Predictor variables were constructed based on previous research findings and expectations from a rational choice framework. In the multivariate comparison between unrecovered vehicles and recovered vehicles in both sites, few significant predictors emerged. Overall, there were more statistically significant predictors in Chula Vista than in Newark. Specifically, in Chula Vista, unrecovered vehicle thefts are more likely to be larger vehicle types. In a second analysis, vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered in Mexico were compared to a random sample of vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered domestically. Vehicles stolen in Chula Vista and recovered in Mexico are significantly younger and more expensive than vehicles recovered in the U.S. Additionally, sports utility vehicles and pick-up trucks are more likely to be taken to Mexico, while 2-door cars are more likely to be recovered domestically. The current study provides partial support for a link between rational choice perspective's focus on increasing rewards and professional vehicle theft in Mexico. It appears that less consideration is given to reducing effort and risk by professional thieves in these areas in comparison to amateur thieves. From a policy standpoint, this study indicates that prevention efforts should target certain vehicles in border cities and focus less on space and time.

AB  - In the context of the epistemological and methodological debates about rational choice (RC) sparked by Green and Shapiro and the subsequent rejoinders, Hindmoor made the theoretical claim that there is now an opportunity for RC to be enhanced and for past debates to be set aside by incorporating different theoretical perspectives into RC. This article presents an example of one context in which this can be done: the study of illegal private protection (IPP) produced by organised criminals and corrupt officials. It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC). Both positive and negative forms and effects of SC are considered. This approach highlights a middle ground between advocates and critics of RC, demonstrating a capacity to explain patterns in the production of IPP between organisations and across countries.

AB  - Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

AB  - Most offenders commit crimes near to the place where they live. According to the author, this is mainly due to transport costs and knowledge of the area. So offenders would only travel a long distance if the earnings are substantial. This article analyses offenders criminal movements, mobility patterns and criminal location choices.

AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Although there is a plethora of research documenting the relationship between firearms and violence, we know little about the influence of offenders' motivation and premeditation as they relate to the choice of weapon for the commission of a violent crime. In this study, we examined a sample of 375 violent crime inmates incarcerated in the New Jersey Department of Corrections. We addressed two research questions: what variables influence the use of a firearm in a violent crime, and do premeditation and motivation increase the odds that an offender will use a firearm in a violent crime? We found that premeditation and motivation are robust covariates of firearm use, which aligns with Rational Choice Theory; this suggests that firearms are used as tools to gain compliance and facilitate the commission of a crime. As a result, prevention strategies that focus on restricting access to firearms to at-risk populations and those that focus on interrupting the cycle of violence may help reduce firearm-related violence, particularly in premeditated events.

AB  - Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example. Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour -- central place foraging, Brownian walks and Levy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Levy walks, respectively. Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Levy walks. The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Levy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed.

AB  - In this study we explore shifting patterns in crime across Wisconsin counties between 1990 and 2000. Building on the three core ecological theories of criminology including strain/anomie, social disorganization and economic rational choice theories we hypothesis that socioeconomic well-being can be used to identify predictable patterns of change in crime. The data generally support the notion that higher levels of socioeconomic well-being at the beginning of the period are associated with lower levels of both violent and property crime at the end of the study period.

AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender—Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.

AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the U.S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way -- so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

AB  - Despite the intense and prolonged public attention received when a child is abducted and killed, there are major gaps in the academic literature. One of the gaps pertains to the distances traveled by the offender between key crime locations. The overall aim of this study was to provide information concerning typical travel distances of offenders. This project utilized an archival data set compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. The database constructed for this project consisted of 72 victims who were abducted and murdered by 68 offenders. The date range for these offenses was 1970-2006. The research questions were addressed with t-tests for independent samples and multiple linear regressions. Three primary dependent variables under investigation in this study were (a) the distance between the offender's residence and the abduction site, (b) the distance between the abduction site and the disposal of the victim's remains, (c) the distance between the location of the body disposal site and the offender's residence. Additionally, a multitude of bivariate analyses were examined. The variables examined in various combinations using bivariate analyses were offender characteristics, victim characteristics, distance variables, and crime event variables. Although findings were primarily insignificant, they contribute to the general literature regarding child abduction homicide offenses. While a number of studies have related child abduction/homicide to specific contexts, little research has been done relating child abduction to theoretical frameworks. This study explored routine activities theory, rational choice theory, and crime pattern theory as they relate to the geographical behavior of child abductors/murderers.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined political influences on communities' allocations of fiscal and personnel resources to policing. Rational choice theory maintains that these resources are distributed in accordance with the need for crime control, whereas conflict theory argues that they are allocated with the aim of controlling racial and ethnic minorities. Existing research more consistently supports the conflict argument, but important issues remain unaddressed. The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective. Class divisions within the Hispanic community may explain this pattern of findings.

AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Mass transit is often thought to be dangerous, eliciting concerns for personal security when waiting for and traveling on mass transit. One of the first steps in preventing crime in mass transit environments is to obtain accurate figures of crime. There are two mechanisms linking mass transit to crime: extension of offenders’ journey-to-crime and development of crime attractors and generators. The first mechanism has been tested by comparing crime patterns when a new light rail system was expanded into new areas; these studies reported that new transit systems do not change crime patterns. Testing the second mechanism, whether mass transit enhances crime opportunities in the neighborhoods by attracting targets and offenders alike, however, faces more challenges; testing the impact of small places on larger areas such as transit stations on crime is fraught with difficulties due to the interactions with their surrounding environments. These difficulties are even more relevant for bus stops located without clear demarcation or controlled access. Using frameworks of routine activity, crime pattern, and rational choice theories, the present study set out to investigate the relationships between bus stops and crime using Newark, New Jersey as the study area. To delineate the impact of bus stops on their surroundings from other possible covariates, the existence of commercial activities in the areas was also examined. The present research study examined five crime types: robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, theft from motor vehicle, and burglary. To better understand the impacts of spatial aspects of the data, several data analyses methods were utilized. First, the study examined the magnitude and structure of spatial dependence in the data. Second, spatial process models were performed and compared with the OLS regression results to examine the impacts of spatial aspects on the regression results. Third, to address non-normality and spatial dependence of the data, the count response model was run by adding spatial lag as one of the predictors. The data analysis results showed that both bus stops and commercial establishments were associated with increased crime in the neighborhoods. Among the business types, some of them displayed more robust relationships than others. For instance, the category of food store was almost always significant to increased crime whereas banks were not statistically significant across crime types and regression methods. Considering the fact that fear of crime plays a strong role as actual risk of crime in making travel decisions, it is suggested that the physical and social incivilities should be analyzed by performing an environmental survey using case-control design. In addition, future research should incorporate both short-term and long-term temporal analysis.

AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

AB  - Considering the extent of the motor vehicle theft (MVT) problem, it is surprising that there is such a dearth of studies on these crimes at the neighborhood level. In 2008, nearly one million vehicles, valued at 6.4 billion dollars, were reported stolen in the United States. Additionally, only half of these stolen vehicles were ever recovered. The purpose of this study is to increase the limited knowledge base on the characteristics of neighborhoods that predict MVT levels. Its focus is on the identification of specific types of land use that increase MVT levels, net the impact of sociodemographics, as posited by the opportunity theories of rational choice, routine activities, and crime pattern theory. The study site is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with its 1816 census block groups serving as the unit of analysis. The percentage of total land area for each block group utilized by various theorized criminogenic land uses is determined by Geographic Information System (GIS). Evaluated land uses include shopping centers, bars, high schools, colleges, parking lots, youth hangouts, and single family homes. A 'proximity space' variable is also computed consisting of the percentage of block group area that is located within one street block of the combined criminogenic land uses. Its usefulness is in determining whether the impact of crime-producing land uses spreads into the surrounding neighborhood. Negative binomial regression models test various hypotheses around the general research question "After controlling for socio-structural correlates, is the presence of certain land uses predictive of MVT levels found at the neighborhood level?" Results demonstrate that land use, both independently and through neighborhood demographic structure, promotes or suppresses MVT levels, a finding consistent with opportunity theories. Specifically, the percentage of land use in block groups utilized by shopping centers, bars, and commercial parking lots is related to higher MVT counts, but that utilized by colleges and single family homes predicts lower MVT counts, net the impact of neighborhood sociodemographics. Interaction models demonstrate that SES, racial heterogeneity, single-parent families, and percentage 15-24 year olds moderate the impact of land use on MVT. Findings are relevant to urban planners, crime practitioners, and crime theorists. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

AB  - Understanding the targeting decisions of terrorist organizations is a key concept that has been largely overlooked in counter-terrorism research. The success of terrorist organizations in Lebanon motivates the current study to assess how their operational decisions changed as Lebanon transitioned from civil war to state instability. Guided by rational choice theory, I explore the idea that terrorist organizations target entities that are most threatening to their chances of survival using data from the Global Terrorism Database. Specifically, the study uses multinomial logistic regression models to understand terrorist targeting choices in Lebanon from 1975 to 2018. While Lebanon is only a case study, I anticipate that the conclusions drawn here can help us understand similar dynamics in other parts of the world. The primary analysis finds a lack of support in predicted patterns of  terrorist targeting. This study also includes a supplemental analysis providing directions for future research.

AB  - HISTORICALLY, RESEARCHERS FROM MANY DISCIPLINES HAVE PROVIDED THEORIES PERTINENT TO THE STUDY OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. INITIALLY, THEORIES OF CRIMINOLOGY EMERGED FROM THE DISCIPLINES OF BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY WITH THE EXPLANATION OF BEHAVIOR ORIENTED TOWARD SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OFFENDER. SOME CONCLUDED THAT THE CRIMINAL WAS A BIOLOGICAL DEGENERATE, WHILE OTHERS THEORIZED THAT THE PSYCHIATRIC OR HEREDITARY FACTORS WERE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE IN EXPLAINING DEVIANT BEHAVIOR. SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES RELATING VARIOUS FACETS OF THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THEN BECAME PROMINENT. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WAS EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF CULTURES IN THE AMERICAN LIFE STYLE AND SOCIETAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS URBANIZATION, DISCRIMINATION, POVERTY, AND FRUSTRATION. ECONOMIST INTRODUCED GENERAL THEORIES OF CRIMINAL MOTIVATION THAT DIFFERED FROM THE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES. SOME THEORIZED THAT CRIME IS THE END RESULT OF A RATIONAL CHOICE ON THE PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHILE OTHERS CONCLUDED THAT CRIME COMPETES WITH LEGAL OCCUPATIONS AS A SOURCE OF INCOME AND IS THEREFORE SIMPLY A BUSINESS ORIENTED ACTIVITY. THIS TYPE OF ECONOMIC THEORY POSTULATES THAT PARTICIPATION IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY VARIES DIRECTLY WITH THE ANTICIPATED NET BENEFITS AND INVERSELY WITH THE ATTRACTIVENESS PROVIDED BY LEGAL OCCUPATIONS.

AB  - Environmental criminology attempts to explain why criminals choose one crime location over another.  Evidence suggests that criminals prefer to stalk neighborhoods with which they are somewhat familiar, yet which are sufficiently populated to provide them with anonymity.  Criminals also prefer areas of the city where there is little chance that law-abiding citizens will intervene against criminal attack.  Thus, security managers must understand the "business envelope" that surrounds their location.  By answering pertinent questions from the potential criminal's point of view, security managers may assess the likelihood that their facilities would be the targets of attack.  Environmental criminologists tend to assume that property criminals will make somewhat rational choices about crime targets to maximize their profits and minimize their efforts.  An understanding of criminal thought patterns allows for the design of target hardening and other preventive efforts.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis study explores rural U.S. crime patterns with a focus on social capital. We use a triangulation of three core theories of crime including social disorganization, anomie/strain, and rational choice theories to develop a formal theory and an empirical framework. The role of four unique measures of social capital is explored in understanding patterns of rural crime using nonmetropolitan U.S. county data. The empirical results generally support the theoretical predictions and conclude that rural communities that pursue economic growth and development must be prepared to address the resulting upward pressures on crime. The results on social capital and crime provide numerous policy insights for rural communities. Reprinted by permission of Blackwell Publishers

AB  - Criminological theories such as routine activities theory, rational choice theory, broken windows and disorder theory, crime pattern and environmental criminology, and social disorganization and collective efficacy theory all suggest the potentiality of a correlation between the presence of abandoned and dilapidated housing and crime. This thesis investigates the geographical locations of homicides that occurred in Kansas City, Missouri in 2016 and dangerous buildings as identified by the municipality. Examination indicates independent clustering of homicides and dangerous buildings and this clustering occurs in the same locational space within the city. Further, the presence of dangerous buildings within census block groups and in surrounding census block groups is correlated with homicides. This finding remains significant when measures of population, poverty, and vacancy are included in the analysis. These outcomes suggest that policies considering the presence of dangerous buildings in conjunction with other violence prevention strategies may be valuable in reducing homicide.

AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the U.S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way -- so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

AB  - Objectives:To determine whether criminogenic “edges,” as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES).Methods:The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected.Results:The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected.Conclusions:The study’s findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an “edge” under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEWDespite the growing availability of effective HIV prevention and treatment interventions, there are large gaps in their uptake and sustained use across settings. It is crucial to elicit and apply patients' and stakeholders' preferences to maximize the impact of existing and future interventions. This review summarizes quantitative preference elicitation methods (PEM) and how they can be applied to improve the delivery and uptake of HIV prevention and treatment interventions.RECENT FINDINGSPEM are increasingly applied in HIV implementation research; however, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have predominated. Beyond DCEs, there are other underutilized PEM that may improve the reach and effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment interventions among individuals by prioritizing their barriers to engagement and determining which attributes of interventions and delivery strategies are most valued. PEM can also enhance the adoption and sustained implementation of strategies to deliver HIV prevention and treatment interventions by assessing which attributes are the most acceptable and appropriate to key stakeholders.SUMMARYGreater attention to and incorporation of patient's and stakeholders' preferences for HIV prevention and treatment interventions and their delivery has the potential to increase the number of persons accessing and retained in HIV prevention and treatment services.

AB  - According to current scholarship on offender decision making, choosing to rob another is based on a variety of individual and situational characteristics. Explanatory models often invoked within environmental criminology include routine activity, rational choice and crime pattern theories. Situational action theory’s suggestion that this decision depends, at least in part, on the interaction between offender criminal propensity and the setting’s moral context has yet to be examined. This investigation tests this idea by conducting structured interviews with active probationers and parolees centered on their decoding of streetscapes to clarify offenders’ perceptions of street robbery opportunities (Part I). These results inform an agent-based simulation contrasting the merits of assumptions made in the previously stated theories to learn how well each generates realistic concentrations of street robbery (Part II). Support emerges for both environmental criminology and situational action theory, but the results differed by the method employed. Implications follow for clarifying the theoretical processes driving these incidents and for promoting public safety.

AB  - Geography and time are the two constraints on illegal acts. The extant research on terrorism suggests that terrorists make an expected cost-benefit analysis, and thus make bounded, rational choices regarding their attacks. They carry out attacks that are likely to benefit their organizational goals, and they commit attacks choosing the easiest way with the least effort. This assumption leads to the conclusion that their attacks are likely to be clustered over space and time, and hence predictable. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the attacks of the PKK—a separatist terrorist organization—form microcycles in Turkey. In this study, we use the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to examine 1261 terrorist attacks of which locations are known and attributed to the PKK. Our research findings suggest significant evidence to conclude that a pattern exists over both space and time regarding distribution of the terrorist attacks. Results from our logistic regression model demonstrate that non-lethal attacks or those occurring in Istanbul or Ankara are more likely to be contagious. We argue that our research findings and policy implications could be useful to create more effective terrorism prevention strategies and policies.

AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - Introduces a special journal symposium (see abstracts of related articles) commemorating the 20th anniversary of Tibor Scitovsky's The Joyless Economy: An Inquiry in Human Satisfaction and Consumer Dissatisfaction (1976), which called into question whether consumer capitalism makes people happy. It is suggested that, in challenging the central tenet of modern liberalism, namely the notion that individual choice reflects the pursuit of rational self-interest, Scitovsky offended both conservatives & radicals alike. Drawing on research in physiological psychology, Scitovsky showed that individual preference makes people unhappy in two ways: (1) it leads individuals to pursue comfort over stimulation; & (2) it disposes individuals to consume relatively simple stimuli rather than more difficult cultural forms of excitement.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined political influences on communities' allocations of fiscal and personnel resources to policing. Rational choice theory maintains that these resources are distributed in accordance with the need for crime control, whereas conflict theory argues that they are allocated with the aim of controlling racial and ethnic minorities. Existing research more consistently supports the conflict argument, but important issues remain unaddressed. The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective. Class divisions within the Hispanic community may explain this pattern of findings.

AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available.". [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - Behavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders. Using a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences. Findings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered -- some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others. The findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.

AB  - BACKGROUNDFor several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geographical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention.OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns.PARTICIPANTSThis study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013.METHODSBy using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern.RESULTSResults suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces.CONCLUSIONSJourneys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior.

AB  - Urban parks play an important role in urban ecosystems with multifunctional services. Park size is one of the important attributes to explain the potential capacity of urban parks. In recent years, the number of studies that focus on the relationship between park size and ecosystem services in the context of ecosystem services has been increasing. This study aims to focus on investigating the relationship between ecosystem services and urban park size. The Web of Science online databases were searched using the keywords "green space", "size" and "urban" as well as related terms. A total of 129 papers meeting the inclusion criteria were examined within the scope of the research aims. The results obtained from the systematic search were summarized and presented in the three categories with sub-categories: (i) cultural services with sub-categories of physical activity (n = 42) and housing prices (n = 10), (ii) supporting services with sub-categories of fauna (n = 44), and flora (n = 3) and (iii) regulating services with sub-categories of microclimate (n = 25) and air quality (n = 5). The results indicated that park size influences a wide range of services by providing more spaces for physical activities, increasing housing prices, creating habitats for birds, insects, and bats, and effects on their richness, diversity and density, increasing the cooling effect capacity and reducing air pollution of urban parks. In conclusion, a comprehensive approach is needed, recognizing the potential of both large and small green spaces to optimize ecosystem services delivery, promote resilience, and enhance urban well-being. This includes considering supply and demand aspects and improving measurement methods. Furthermore, exploring optimal improvements across diverse park sizes remains a promising avenue for research, contributing to the development of more efficient urban green spaces.

AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the U.S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

AU  - Kaukinen, Catherine

Y1  - 1999-01-01
DA  - 0, 1999
AB  - Whereas traditional criminological approaches to crime victim reporting have drawn on rational choice explanations, the wider help-seeking literature is used here to examine how the victim-offender relationship causes victims to define their victimizations & determines the types of reporting & help-seeking strategies they utilize. This approach shifts the focus away from individual rational choice to an examination of the way in which patterns of decisions are socially constructed (Pescosolido, 1992). The major findings are (1) the majority of victims report their victimization to their friends &/or family members & only a small number report to the police or other formal help sources; (2) attacks on women by marital partners are most likely to result in nonreporting or complete reporting as compared to help-seeking from family & friends; (3) the effect of the victim-offender relationship on reporting is not easily conceptualized in a police vs nonreporting comparison. These findings indicate that previous research may have failed to examine the effect of the victim-offender relationship across appropriate help-seeking categories. Finally, the differences in the reporting of victimizations to the police & other help sources may be understood as related to the seriousness of the crime. Implications point to the need for situational & incident-specific approaches to the study of victimization.

AB  - According to this worldview, the rational individual enters into a social contract and by breaking it (the laws of society) is demonstrating his or her free will and rational choice.  The concept of Community Policing from which this program evolved (and which is widely practiced in a variety of stressed communities across the country) is at its core dedicated to the close partnership ofthat community and their police, who mobilize together to heal, repair, and create an environment of less social disorganization through, in part, community empowerment and the recognition of the community's needs and desires. * Marie Volpe, director of the Dispute Resolution Center at John Jay College, has patterned her program along themes of healing in restorative justice and the history of various International Truth and Reconciliation Panels.

AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - As many states, including California, legalized marijuana for medicinal and recreational use, the federal government for the previous 50 years never legally waivered in its position prohibiting cannabis manufacturing, sales, transportation, distribution, and possession. Considered on par with opioids and methamphetamine, cannabis was federally illegal and determined to have no accepted medical use and the highest potential for drug abuse. There was very little literature and a significant gap in qualitative research when considering California's cannabis legalization regulations and their impact on local police officers. Therefore, the generic qualitative study sought to determine how California's local law enforcement officers perceived and were affected by the disparity between state cannabis legalization regulations versus federal cannabis prohibition. The research question asked, considering the opposing federal and state cannabis laws, what were the behaviors, perceptions, attitudes, and lived experiences of police officers in California when dealing with cannabis? A representative sample of experienced, local police officers from California were purposefully selected to voluntarily participate in the study, framing the theoretical perspective in terms of the rational choice theory. The findings revealed that California's ambiguous cannabis regulations were the source of confusion and frustration for police officers who perceived an increased pattern of cannabis use and abuse in their communities with juveniles, intoxicated driving, and within the unregulated criminal cannabis market. The findings further determined that more research was needed to consider the broader implications of California's complicated legalization regulations and the overall impact on California's criminal justice system.

AB  - The following dissertation explored the criminological phenomenon of home-invasion robbery by investigating the behavioral characteristics associated to perpetration. The problem considered pertained to the behavioral patterns of perpetration related to crime commission that is unknown to practitioners and law enforcement professionals. Recent studies have examined home-invasion victimization and environmental methods implemented to prevent victimization; unfortunately, little empirical research exists on the behavioral patterns of home-invasion perpetration. This study was performed to enhance and examine what was currently known about home-invasion robbery. The researcher collected and assessed approximately 20 case files of home-invasion robbery obtained from a large metropolitan police department in the southern region of the United States. Rational choice theory was integrated into the theoretical framework and recapitulated in the literature review. The literature review expounded upon aspects associated to home-invasion victimization, perpetration characteristics, the need for further research pertaining to home-invasion robbery, and the application of environmental criminology as an additional method of assessing perpetration patterns of offenders. The empirical study conducted was qualitative, with the purpose of verifying the existence of perpetration patterns of home-invasion robbery and to determine if a collective set of patterns exists among them. The researcher was able to establish a baseline for home-invasion offender typologies to include: (a) Emulator, (b) Monetarist, (c) Associate, (d) Tyrant, and (e) Consumer. Furthermore, the researcher established a set of baseline classifications of entry to include: (a) Enticer, (b) Intimidator, (c) Predator, and (d) Opportunist.

AB  - People's movements across time and space affect crime opportunities, and in turn, are influenced by the physical environment. Facilities such as bars, shopping malls, schools, and entertainment districts for example affect routine activities and the criminal event. Such places act as crime attractors or generators. Attractors possess crime opportunities, pulling intending criminals who act on these opportunities, while generators do not necessarily draw intending criminals, but possess many opportunities resulting in crime problems. Spectator events such as hockey games draw large numbers of people and may function as crime attractors and/or generators and such impacts on crime patterns have been largely unexplored. This analysis examines the home arena of a local National Hockey League club as a possible attractor/generator. As a spectator event, this venue draws many people into Vancouver's downtown core on game nights, changing crime opportunities and the spatio-temporal distribution of crime in the downtown. Keywords: Crime attractors, crime generators, spectator events. Subject Terms: Environmental criminology, routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, rational choice theory

AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers' incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods.

AB  - Several changes in terrorist tactics have occurred recently. First, terrorist attack targets have changed from hard to soft targets. Second, terrorists are actively using low-tech terrorism methods that they can choose easily. Finally, terrorist attacks are evolving into complex and simultaneous terrorist events. This study endeavored to determine whether these changes affected the number of casualties from terrorist events that occurred in developed countries. Based on the rational choice theory and situational crime prevention, the variables were constructed based on two dimensions: “target factors in terrorism” and “terrorist attack factors in terrorism.” To achieve the purpose of this study, a negative binomial regression analysis was performed based on data from the Global Terrorism Database. Consequently, variables such as “exposure,” “protection capability,” “attack patterns (vehicle),” and “suicide terrorism” were verified for their statistically significant influence on “mass casualty terrorism (MCT).” This study suggests that it is necessary to design a preventive environment and arrange for personnel at each site that is vulnerable to terrorism to prevent MCT events from occurring inside facilities.

AB  - Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

AB  - According to the organized-disorganized model, organized sexual murderers adopt specific behaviors during the commission of their crimes that contribute to avoiding police detection. The current study examines the effect of sexual murderers' organized behaviors on their ability to both delay and/or avoid police detection. Using a combination of negative binomial and logistic regression analyses on a sample of 350 sexual murder cases, findings showed that although both measures of delaying and avoiding detection are positively correlated, different behavioral patterns were observed. For instance, offenders who moved the victim's body were more likely to avoid detection but the victim's body was likely to be recovered faster. Moreover, victim characteristics have an impact on both measures; however, this effect disappears for the measure of delaying detection once the organized behaviors are introduced. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Gordon Tullock was an economist's economist, or a "natural-born economist." For someone to be a "natural" at doing economics, not simply knowing economics, "is to suggest that he or she has intrinsic talents that emerge independent of professional training, education, and experience" (Buchanan [1987] 2001, 95). As D. N. McCloskey puts it, a "Natural understands economics the first time he hears it. The rest of us need repetitions at higher and higher levels, like a spiral staircase; the Natural does not; he gets the point at the bottom" (1992, 239). Using rational-choice theory, the natural-born economist is able to discern how individuals take actions consistent with their goals or how individuals "do their best" given the constraints they are facing at the moment of choice. Does having been regarded by other economists as a natural also imply that Gordon Tullock was an economic imperialist, relentlessly applying the logic of homo economicus to all walks of life? For those familiar with the depth and breadth of Tullock's application of economic analysis to crime, law, politics, and history, it would seem obvious to answer this question in the affirmative. However, the term economic imperialism implies the injection of the notion of homo economicus to human decision making that is "unnatural" or beyond the realm of traditional economic analysis, such as applying the notion of homo economicus into the realm of nonmarket decision making. For example, economist Edward Lazear defines economic imperialism as "the extension of economics to topics that go beyond the classical scope of issues, which include consumer choice, theory of the firm, (explicit) markets, macroeconomic activity, and the fields spawned directly by these areas. The most aggressive economic imperialists aim to explain all social behavior by using the tools of economics. Areas traditionally deemed to be outside the realm of economics because they do not use explicit markets or prices are analyzed by the economic imperialist" (2000, 103). Such a characterization of Tullock as a "natural-born economist" would imply, however, that he regarded homo economicus as an unorthodox model to understand human choice outside the realm of markets, including topics such as biology, crime, revolution, and war. However, he understood that the emergence of economics as an intellectual discipline occurred without any strong methodological divide from the other social sciences. As he put it, "Although we can see clearly from their [Adam Smith's and David Hume's] work, particularly, of course, Smith's Wealth of Nations, the origins of scientific economics, it does not appear that they felt that the distinction between economics and the rest of the social sciences was of any great importance. The Wealth of Nations, after all, contains chapters on military affairs, administration of justice, public works, and education. . . . With Hume and Smith, then, we see an 'economic' approach to a very large part of social behavior" ([1972] 2004, 7-8). What changed, therefore, during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century was the common understanding held among economists about what it meant to do economics (see Boettke and Candela 2017). An alternative way to interpret the depth and breadth of Tullock's contributions to economic science is to regard him as a praxeologist, or a "natural-born Misesian," in that he understood economic analysis to be the most developed subset of a broader and more general science of human action, one that traces the origins of all social phenomena back to individuals' goals. From this perspective, Tullock understood himself as part of a broader tradition of political economy tracing back to Adam Smith. For the natural-born Misesian, homo economicus already exists outside the realm of markets, but the role of the economist as a social scientist is to understand the institutional constraints within which the infinite variations of homo economicus are manifested. In this paper, we argue that Tullock was not just a "natural-born economist" but more broadly a "natural-born Misesian." Our argument has two aspects. First, we contend that Tullock, like Ludwig von Mises, understood homo economicus broadly as homo agens, or acting man, for whom choice is open-ended, rather than as a Robbinsian maximizer, for whom choice is a close-ended maximization of given means and given ends. As Richard Wagner states, Tullock regarded the logic of choice "as only a point of analytical departure. It was never a destination, for Tullock was always a social theorist who never reduced society to a representative agent" (forthcoming). Second, we argue that Tullock, as a natural-born Misesian, understood homo economicus to be a necessary though not a sufficient condition for understanding patterns of human decision making under alternative institutional arrangements. Taken together, these two views of Tullock's understanding of praxeology give us a perspective on the qualities of the natural-born Misesian.

AB  - This dissertation proposes that ecological theories are incomplete for explaining both large-scale provisioning of organizational justice and violence precipitating from interpersonal disputes. Ecological theories (e.g., some rational choice theories, human behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology) posit that individuals are capable of maximizing their goals (e.g., fitness) within their environmental constraints. These theories assume that knowledge of human nature and environmental contingencies are enough to explain behavior. In contrast, cultural evolutionary theory proposes that institutions are a central component of human environments. Thus, with mechanistic predictions about the dynamic nature of institutions, cultural evolutionary theory can explain patterns of justice behavior—all other environmental variables held constant—that vary between regions or throughout history. Further, with specific attention to the cooperative nature of justice, cultural evolutionary theory explains how institutional rules are required to promote participation, trust, and legitimacy. Part I of this dissertation describes the institutional rules of Sungusungu “vigilante” organizations that emerged as a grass-roots social movement to control crime. A few organizational chapters were studied in southwestern Tanzania using participant observation and survey methods. First, cultural evolutionary theory is used to explain dynamic patterns of Sungusungu behavior. Second, with attention to ecological and cultural evolutionary theories of cooperation, it is found that institutional rules motivate Sungusungu cooperation, especially on large scales. Finally, methods developed by experimental economists are used to show that institutional rules influence preferences to share and punish between different ethnic groups and at different social scales. Part II uses cultural evolutionary theory and definitions of social control institutions to explain dynamic patterns of male dispute-related violence. Empirical data illustrate ecological theories of mate competition cannot explain historical trends in violence, diversity of institutions in similar environmental conditions, and other seemingly cultural patterns. Finally, homicide data from United States counties are used to test the hypothesis that “culture of honor” institutions are stronger than peacemaking institutions in the rural South. Assuming honor institutions influence age-specific offending rates, the cultural evolutionary hypothesis is supported. Dispute-related homicide rates involve greater relative proportions of older offenders in the rural South as compared to the rural North.

AB  -  In this study we explore shifting patterns in crime across Wisconsin counties between 1990 and 2000. Building on the three core ecological theories of criminology including strain/anomie, social disorganization and economic rational choice theories we hypothesis that socioeconomic well-being can be used to identify predictable patterns of change in crime. The data generally support the notion that higher levels of socioeconomic well-being at the beginning of the period are associated with lower levels of both violent and property crime at the end of the study period.

AB  - In recent years, along with the development of the urban public transport system, bus pickpocketing crimes have garnered increasing attention. In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes.

AB  - The concept of crime displacement has received considerable attention within the crime prevention literature, but the methodology used for much of this research has limitations. Specifically, many of the existing studies that measure the extent of displacement use secondary data sources, such as police records and service calls, which are designed for other purposes. Moreover, the predominant approach for studying displacement has been to observe changes in aggregate crime patterns in and around hot spots targeted for police interventions. Rarely do studies take a micro-level approach to examine displacement from viewpoint of the adapting offender who is forced to change his spatial, temporal and tactical patterns of behavior. This dissertation seeks to further our understanding of the causal mechanisms that produce crime displacement, as well as the cognitive processes that determine which methods of adaptation are likely to result from different intervention strategies. The study seeks to answer three questions: (1) Does the research find evidence of aggregate spatial or temporal displacement effects in the study sites?; (2) What are the social conditions and personal attributes that shape the decision making process relating to displacement?; and (3) How do neighborhood conditions such as the level of physical disorder impact patterns of crime displacement? Furthermore, the dissertation draws from the rational choice literature and environmental criminology to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the micro-level decision making processes involved in offender adaptation. Three study sites in Jersey City, New Jersey were examined using a controlled experimental design. Police intervention strategies that have been shown to produce crime reduction benefits were developed for each of the target areas. The Jersey City Police Department implemented the interventions with a high level of intensity to maximize the potential for crime displacement. Multiple data sources were used to measure various forms of displacement resulting from the interventions. The study draws from interviews with offenders arrested in the target areas, as well as social observations, household surveys and place-manager interviews conducted in the study sites.

AB  - Individuals with disabilities experience victimization at rates higher than their typically-functioning peers. Because they are often perceived as unreliable reporters, the likelihood that victimizations of individuals with disabilities are reported is low. Data regarding the lived victimization experiences of individuals with specific disabilities are scant. Grounded in the rational choice theory and Cohen and Felson’s routine activity theory, this qualitative study investigated the victimization experiences of school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the rural Southern US. This study involved 21 public school students between the ages of 12 and 17 who were interviewed using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire, second revision. Multiple themes were extricated from interview data through descriptive coding. Students with autism are most likely to be victimized in areas that are unstructured and have inadequate supervision. When a weapon was used during victimization, it was most often a weapon of opportunity, and types of victimization most experienced by students involved chasing, grabbing, or being forced to do something they did not want to do. This study identified fear of punishment and embarrassment as the most considerable barriers to self-reporting victimizations to appropriate authorities. This study’s results can be used by families, educators, and service providers to assist in supporting change for individuals with autism that are at risk for experiencing victimization. Study data may have a positive social impact by preventing victimization through the identification of potential victims, providing situational intervention in high risk areas, and supporting intervention in situations involving victimization for individuals with autism

AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Spatial analysis looks for statistically significant patterns in observed events that occur at specified locations. Most examples of spatial analysis consider aggregate characteristics over a number of coarsely defined regions rather than point processes. However, criminal events are point processes and should be modeled as such. In this paper, we combine recent advances in discrete choice theory and data mining to develop point process models for spatial analysis. We use this new methodology to analyze and predict the spatial behavior of criminals, and more generally, latent decision makers. The paper compares the performance of this methodology to more traditional hot spot methods of crime analysis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Mass transit is often thought to be dangerous, eliciting concerns for personal security when waiting for and traveling on mass transit. One of the first steps in preventing crime in mass transit environments is to obtain accurate figures of crime. There are two mechanisms linking mass transit to crime: extension of offenders' journey-to-crime and development of crime attractors and generators. The first mechanism has been tested by comparing crime patterns when a new light rail system was expanded into new areas; these studies reported that new transit systems do not change crime patterns. Testing the second mechanism, whether mass transit enhances crime opportunities in the neighborhoods by attracting targets and offenders alike, however, faces more challenges; testing the impact of small places on larger areas such as transit stations on crime is fraught with difficulties due to the interactions with their surrounding environments. These difficulties are even more relevant for bus stops located without clear demarcation or controlled access. Using frameworks of routine activity, crime pattern, and rational choice theories, the present study set out to investigate the relationships between bus stops and crime using Newark, New Jersey as the study area. To delineate the impact of bus stops on their surroundings from other possible covariates, the existence of commercial activities in the areas was also examined. The present research study examined five crime types: robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, theft from motor vehicle, and burglary. To better understand the impacts of spatial aspects of the data, several data analyses methods were utilized. First, the study examined the magnitude and structure of spatial dependence in the data. Second, spatial process models were performed and compared with the OLS regression results to examine the impacts of spatial aspects on the regression results. Third, to address non-normality and spatial dependence of the data, the count response model was run by adding spatial lag as one of the predictors. The data analysis results showed that both bus stops and commercial establishments were associated with increased crime in the neighborhoods. Among the business types, some of them displayed more robust relationships than others. For instance, the category of food store was almost always significant to increased crime whereas banks were not statistically significant across crime types and regression methods. Considering the fact that fear of crime plays a strong role as actual risk of crime in making travel decisions, it is suggested that the physical and social incivilities should be analyzed by performing an environmental survey using case-control design. In addition, future research should incorporate both short-term and long-term temporal analysis. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

AB  - Price rigidity involves the observation of prices that do not change with the regularity predicted by standard economic theory. As IT changes the process by which strategic pricing decisions are made and implemented in business operations, there is a need to develop a more substantial managerial understanding of firm pricing in production process terms. In the 1990s, technology-driven pricing was largely the domain of the airlines, hotels and rental car companies, with the practice of revenue yield management. However, now it is possible for bricks-and-clicks firms, and even traditional retailers, to implement systems that permit significant adjustments to be made to prices in situations where menu costs previously made rapid price changes difficult to achieve in an economical way. This dissertation is composed of three essays involving theory development and empirical research on the price rigidity in e-commerce. The first essay, entitled "An Analysis of Daily Price Change Activity in Internet Retailing ," is a case study exploring daily patterns of Internet pricing for the two major online bookstores, Amazon.com and BN.com at a micro-level of analysis, informing our understanding of how rigid prices are on the Internet. In the second essay, entitled "Price Rigidity in Internet-Based Selling: Theory and Evidence," I propose and evaluate a research framework to examine different theories of price rigidity. I also explore what variables can explain the observed empirical regularities and variations in price adjustment patterns of Internet-based retailers. Finally, my third essay, entitled " Price Points and Price Rigidity under Rational Inattention," investigates the practical importance of price points and their link to price rigidity. I also provide a rational choice explanation for their existence, based on rational inattention theory. This dissertation draws upon theoretical perspectives that are largely new to the field of Information Systems (IS), but that offer rich opportunities for theory building and empirical research in settings that will be of high interdisciplinary interest. Such interdisciplinary studies, I believe, will provide a distinctive foundation for IS research and serve as a guide to research for a variety of new economic phenomena in economies that are influenced by firm investments in Internet technology.

AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. Reprinted by permission of Springer

AB  - One of the issues brought on by rapid urbanization is the loss of livability owing to poor waste management, a lack of resources, air pollution, traffic congestion, and outdated buildings and public infrastructure. The idea of a smart city has arisen as one of the potential solutions to this concern. In this study, we have demonstrated how citizen science helps immensely to the growth of a smart city by crowdsourcing data about urban decay. Tehran, the capital of Iran, which is home to the history of many people's social lives, has begun losing some of its vitality. Municipalities have plans for dealing with urban decline and revival, but we indicate that volunteered geographic information (VGI) would be more effective in turning such ideas into practice. According to our research, there are three different types of organizations active in urban renewal: municipalities, civil and urban planning agencies, and organizations that support tourism and cultural heritage. As a result, we provided a system design that outlines the duties that each institution has in relation to urban renewal. In addition, we suggested a service broker with the capacity to publish VGI in order to offer interoperability related to geographic data and services based on spatial data infrastructure (SDI). Beyond that, various types of urban decay, necessary management procedures, the sequence of information in system components, and the volunteer's behavior confronting the system were all specified in the form of an object-oriented design. A prototype system based on state-of-the-art in open-source technologies was developed to test our hypothesis. The VGI system enabled us to monitor urban decay events in real time using the management dashboard. We have shown that volunteers can distinguish between urban declines and typical instances like a binary classifier in the quality control method proposed in this study. Performance was 90% based on the findings of the quality control. A running VGI system would start beneficence after 3 months and make a profit of 150% after a year, based on our estimates.

AB  - Traditionally, where our bushfires have been the product of human intervention the culprits have ranged from the careless cigarette butt disposer or backyard burn-off enthusiast to the occasional pyromaniac. Yet just as serial killers represent our image of all murderers, the demon who finds inexplicable pleasure in fire and destruction has captured the public imagination when it comes to the portrayal of the bushfire arsonist. This has coloured the debate about appropriate penalties for those caught with the matches and the kero.Pyromaniacs excluded, arsonists tend to commit the offence infrequently. When they do indulge in fire lighting wilfully, they are confident that they won't get caught. Thus the argument that tougher penalties will deter these offenders is problematic. In addition, young people involved in fire lighting may engage in this among many other forms of delinquency and destructive behaviour. With this in mind, it is the delinquent pattern of the juvenile arsonist that criminal justice must address if arson is to be controlled along with so many more common and regular forms of damage to community property. The urge to damage community property in all its forms is a disturbingly common feature of juvenile delinquency.Another consideration that the law's response to the bushfire crisis puts into stark relief is the community's expectations for punishment. I've already mentioned deterrence and its essential dependence on the fact that an offender considers the possibility of apprehension. But for deterrence to work, it must be assumed that the offender makes a rational choice to light fires, and is not intoxicated or beyond appreciating the consequences of his actions. The sheer craziness of these events challenges these assumptions.

AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent rational choice plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that power as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

AB  - The terrorist decision-making process is the key component of understanding the types of attacks terrorists execute, and the group’s ideology is the goal-orientation portion of that rational decision-making process. Terrorist group ideology determines a number of aspects of the decision-making process that expand or limit the targets groups will attack and the tactics they will use to achieve their larger ideological goals. These aspects include: a group’s long-term goals, short-term objectives, an attack’s purpose, the audience, the group’s constituency, its enemies, and its message. Terrorism is a tactic of asymmetrical warfare and a unique form of violent crime. Acts of terrorism and their perpetrators come in a variety of forms, each of which presents a different threat of violence, and occurs within a set of intricate circumstances. Using a database of terrorist group ideologies of my own making, the Global Terrorism Database, Polity IV, the Political Instability Taskforce, and Major Episodes of Political Violence, I establish the link between terrorist ideology and terrorist behavior. I first established the number of terrorist perpetrators of each ideology type and evaluated the assassination, armed assault and bombing attacks they carried out against business, government, police, military and civilian targets. Second, I evaluated ideology’s impact on terrorist behavior controlling for political violence and instability, geographic, time, and country and group-level variables. Finally, I evaluated the behavior of unknown terrorist perpetrators in the aggregate and over time between 1998 and 2013. There are four major findings of this dissertation. First, there is a relationship between terrorist ideology and terrorist behavior. Second, some terrorist behaviors were consistent across ideologies and over time. Third, the geographic and political instability and violence context in which terrorism occurs affects terrorist behavior. Finally, the incidents committed by unknown perpetrators are geographically concentrated and their behavior patterns are similar to the general behaviors of identifiable perpetrators. Counterterrorism researchers and practitioners can use this information to anticipate and counter threats from terrorists of different ideologies and unknown perpetrators.

AB  - While street crimes have been a primary concern of most scholars in South Korea, white collar crime or corporate crime did not immediately capture the attention of those who studying criminal behavior. This paper explores the causes of Korean firms' crimes. Rational choice perspective argues that firms participate in crime to achieve their profit goals in the market competition or uncertain environments. In contrast, normative or cultural perspective asserts that firms follow illegal culture in their field, but if institutional environments are changed their customs will be crimes. This paper will focus on the changes of the causes of crime according to the time periods using the longitudinal data from 196 KOSPI listed firms through 15 years. The results are as follows; (1) Large firms are more likely to commit crimes than small firms. (2) Firms with prior violations are more likely commit crimes than firms without prior violations. (3) The pattern of corporate crime are changed from political to social & economic character. While the state-corporate associative strategy greatly affected on crimes before 1997(economic crisis), the competitive strategy from market pressure worked in decisive factors after 1997. (4) Corporations with loosely coupled system are likely to commit crimes than ones more tightly coupled. (5) The more increasing uncertainty & institutional pressure, professionals or organizational department are employed for managing crime.

AB  - The concept of crime displacement has received considerable attention within the crime prevention literature, but the methodology used for much of this research has limitations. Specifically, many of the existing studies that measure the extent of displacement use secondary data sources, such as police records and service calls, which are designed for other purposes. Moreover, the predominant approach for studying displacement has been to observe changes in aggregate crime patterns in and around hot spots targeted for police interventions. Rarely do studies take a micro-level approach to examine displacement from viewpoint of the adapting offender who is forced to change his spatial, temporal and tactical patterns of behavior. This dissertation seeks to further our understanding of the causal mechanisms that produce crime displacement, as well as the cognitive processes that determine which methods of adaptation are likely to result from different intervention strategies. The study seeks to answer three questions: (1) Does the research find evidence of aggregate spatial or temporal displacement effects in the study sites?; (2) What are the social conditions and personal attributes that shape the decision making process relating to displacement?; and (3) How do neighborhood conditions such as the level of physical disorder impact patterns of crime displacement? Furthermore, the dissertation draws from the rational choice literature and environmental criminology to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the micro-level decision making processes involved in offender adaptation. Three study sites in Jersey City, New Jersey were examined using a controlled experimental design. Police intervention strategies that have been shown to produce crime reduction benefits were developed for each of the target areas. The Jersey City Police Department implemented the interventions with a high level of intensity to maximize the potential for crime displacement. Multiple data sources were used to measure various forms of displacement resulting from the interventions. The study draws from interviews with offenders arrested in the target areas, as well as social observations, household surveys and place-manager interviews conducted in the study sites.

AB  - In this article we present results from research on how education environments may influence the propensity of education participants to engage in corrupt practices. We approached this task with the help of a conceptual framework that draws on rational choice and routine activity theory, and on economic models of human behaviour. The framework guided a collection of evidence through desk research, numerous interviews and focus groups on behalf of authorities and civil society in five countries (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Serbia, Tunisia, Ukraine). Our findings suggest that circumstances in education influence problematic conduct in two major ways -- by opening opportunities for the abuse of regular processes in education, and by providing education participants with incentives to engage in it. This contribution offers some insights concerning the incentives of education participants to participate in corruption and discusses why research on corruption can be a valuable source of guidance for systemic improvement in education.

AB  -  This article discusses a specific crime - assault - usually registered in domicile victimization surveys, as compared to stealing and robberies. It debates whether rational choice theory is suitable to understand crimes as registered in theses surveys. As far as assault is concerned, this theory is unable to explain the association between social context and victimization risk, markedly different for women and men, as well as more linked to power and recognition than to material gains or assets. Furthermore, the differences between feminine and masculine patterns of victimization by assault could not be interpreted only by the commonly used theory of the patriarchal family, and should be illuminated by recent changes in urban life, family patterns and in the construction of masculine identities and practices, as suggested by the theories of hyper masculinity or warrior ethos. This may be useful for changing public policies aiming prevention of violence in interpersonal relationships.

AB  - Legal documents serve as valuable repositories of information pertaining to crimes, encompassing not only legal aspects but also relevant details about criminal behaviors. To date and the best of our knowledge, no studies in the field examine legal documents for crime understanding using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. The present study aims to fill this research gap by identifying relevant information available in legal documents for crime prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This innovative approach will be applied to the specific crime of Intimate Partner Femicide (IPF). A total of 491 legal documents related to lethal and non-lethal violence by male-to-female intimate partners were extracted from the Vlex legal database. The information included in these documents was analyzed using AI algorithms belonging to Bayesian, functions-based, instance-based, tree-based, and rule-based classifiers. The findings demonstrate that specific information from legal documents, such as past criminal behaviors, imposed sanctions, characteristics of violence severity and frequency, as well as the environment and situation in which this crime occurs, enable the correct detection of more than three-quarters of both lethal and non-lethal violence within male-to-female intimate partner relationships. The obtained knowledge is crucial for professionals who have access to legal documents, as it can help identify high-risk IPF cases and shape strategies for preventing crime. While this study focuses on IPF, this innovative approach has the potential to be extended to other types of crimes, making it applicable and beneficial in a broader context.

AB  - Forest crimes are among the serious threats destroying forests. To prevent the forest crimes there are various solutions proposed, such as fortification of the laws, increasing the penalties, or increasing the public awareness. This article, however, suggests an alternative solution of preventing the forest crimes by investigating the relations between the individual financial supports provided to forest villagers and the levels of various forest crime types in Turkey. The study shows that, when the forest villagers are given financial supports, the levels of illegal logging, illegal transferring of forest products, illegal expansion of private lands into forests, illegal processing of trees, and illegal pasturage crimes decrease significantly. However, the financial supports do not affect the levels of illegal occupation of forestlands crime.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical time in the U.S. for religious development in that many young people eschew their religious identity as they enter adulthood. In general, religion is associated with a number of positive health outcomes including decreased substance use and depression. The current study compared the developmental patterns of religiosity and spirituality in heterosexual and sexual minority youth. The design was a secondary data analysis of the first five waves of the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and Wellness (N = 337, 71.8% female). Using multilevel linear (for spirituality) and quadratic (for religiosity) growth models, the initial level and change over time in religiosity and spirituality, as well as the correlations between growth processes, were compared between heterosexual and sexual minority individuals. The heterosexual group had significantly higher initial religiosity levels than the sexual minority group. Religiosity decreased over time at a similar rate for the heterosexual and sexual minority groups. Spirituality significantly increased over time for the sexual minority group but not for the heterosexual youth. The change over time in religiosity and spirituality were significantly and positively correlated for heterosexual individuals but were uncorrelated for sexual minority individuals. Results indicate there are differences in religious development based on sexual minority status. Future research should take into account how these differential religious and spiritual developmental patterns seen in heterosexual and sexual minority youth might predict various health outcomes.

AB  - The circumvention of female reproductive choice via rape is a costly and evolutionarily persistent threat to women's reproductive fitness. This is argued to have generated selection pressure for a precautionary threat management system for rape avoidance among women. Such a system would regulate women's fear of rape as a functional emotional response to inputs providing information about the current risk and reproductive cost of rape. Fear of rape is expected to subsequently motivate adaptive behavior to avoid threats to one's reproductive choice. The current research tested key tenets of this proposed system and found that women report greater fear of rape as a function of characteristics that alter the likelihood of being victimized, including being younger, living in a neighborhood perceived as dangerous, living in close proximity to family, and having been the victim of a sexual assault in the past. We also discuss mixed and null results with respect to the role of relationship status and mate value. In turn, fear of rape was associated with behavior expected to reduce one's risk of being victimized. Specifically, women who were more fearful of rape reported consuming true crime media with greater frequency and indicated that this consumption was specifically motivated by the desire to learn strategies to prevent or escape an attack. Overall, results were fairly consistent with a threat management system approach and may help to explain why fear of rape is a powerful feature of women's psychology.

AB  - There is growing evidence that crime is strongly concentrated in micro-geographic hot spots, a fact that has led to the wide-scale use of hot spots policing programs. Such programs are ordinarily focused on deterrence due to police presence, or other law enforcement interventions at hot spots. However, preliminary basic research studies suggest that informal social controls may also be an important mechanism for crime reduction on high crime streets. Such research has been hindered by a lack of data on social and attitudinal characteristics of residents, and the fact that census information is not available at the micro-geographic level. Our study, conducted in Baltimore, MD, on a sample of 449 residential street segments, overcame these limitations by collecting an average of eight surveys (N = 3738), as well as physical observations, on segments studied. This unique primary data collection allowed us to develop the first direct indicators of collective efficacy at the micro-geographic level, as well as a wide array of indicators of other possible risk and protective factors for crime. Using multilevel negative binomial regression models, we also take into account community-level influences, and oversample crime hot spots to allow for robust comparisons across streets. Our study confirms the importance of opportunity features of streets such as population size and business activity in understanding crime, but also shows that informal social controls, as reflected by collective efficacy, are key for understanding crime on high crime streets. We argue that it is time for police, other city agencies, and NGOs to begin to work together to consider how informal social controls can be used to reduce crime at residential crime hot spots.

AB  - Though an impressive array of health outcomes has been studied, research within the field of religion and health has not yet considered how religious involvement may affect future expectations about health. This is a significant shortcoming because the teachings of many religions direct adherent's focus to the distant future, and future self-ratings of health are a known predictor of subjective life expectancy and eventual mortality risk. Recognizing the need for a life course approach to conceptualizing patterns of religious involvement, we assess how stability or change in religious attendance from childhood to adulthood structures individual expectations of future health. Drawing on data from the 2017 Values and Beliefs of the American Public Study (Baylor Religion Survey Wave 5), we find that stable high (weekly) attendance between childhood and adulthood is associated with higher future health expectations. Parametric mediation analyses conducted in the counterfactual framework suggest that this association is explained by the tendency of frequent stable attenders to have (a) higher levels of beliefs in the sense of divine control and (b) a lower likelihood of engaging in harmful health behaviors (smoking).

AB  - Despite increasing knowledge of social and biological risk factors for callous-unemotional (CU) traits, relatively less is known about how these two sets of risk factors combine to affect these traits. The current longitudinal study investigated pathways from parenting style to CU traits via resting heart rate in a three-year project. Parents of 382 children completed the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire at Time 1 (children Mean age = 9.06, SD = 0.94, range = 7-11 years), with the heart rate data collected at Time 2 (M = 10.16, SD = 0.93, range = 8-13 years) and CU traits assessed at Time 3 (M = 11.06, SD = 0.94, range = 9-13 years). We found that parenting style and CU traits were associated with resting heart rate, and that structural equation modeling showed resting heart rate to partially mediate the effect of parenting style on CU traits. Specifically, higher levels of authoritarian parenting were associated with lower resting heart rate, which in turn was linked to higher level of CU traits. On the contrary, children in the context of authoritative parenting showed relatively higher resting heart rate, which was predictive of lower CU traits. Overall, findings have implications for understanding the etiology of CU traits in children and developing effective prevention programs for children with affective deficits.

AB  - Although social influences have been identified that protect against the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior, there has been no prior research on biological protective factors. This study examines whether high resting heart rate may be one such factor. Resting heart rate was measured in 405 children of parents from a birth cohort, together with antisocial behavior in both the parent and the child. Children who were not antisocial, but had a parent high on antisocial behavior, had higher resting heart rates than all three other parent-child antisocial behavior groupings. Results withstood control for age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, and psychosocial adversity. Robustness checks confirmed these results. Findings are the first to identify a biological protective factor against the intergenerational transmission of childhood antisocial behavior.
