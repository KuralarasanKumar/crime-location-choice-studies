TI  - Target Selection Models with Preference Variation Between Offenders
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study explores preference variation in location choice strategies of residential burglars. Applying a model of offender target selection that is grounded in assertions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, crime pattern and social disorganization theories, it seeks to address the as yet untested assumption that crime location choice preferences are the same for all offenders.
   Analyzing detected residential burglaries from Brisbane, Australia, we apply a random effects variant of the discrete spatial choice model to estimate preference variation between offenders across six location choice characteristics. Furthermore, in attempting to understand the causes of this variation we estimate how offenders' spatial target preferences might be affected by where they live and by their age.
   Findings of this analysis demonstrate that while in the aggregate the characteristics of location choice are consistent with the findings from previous studies, considerable preference variation is found between offenders.
   This research highlights that current understanding of choice outcomes is relatively poor and that existing applications of the discrete spatial choice approach may underestimate preference variation between offenders.

TI  - A discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection at the house-level
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This article studies how burglars select a house to burglarize. We draw on the rational choice perspective to investigate how burglars select a target by relying on house-related attributes to optimize a combination of perceived rewards, efforts and risk. It extends current applications of the discrete spatial choice framework to burglary target selection by adopting the house as the spatial unit of analysis and studies burglars' target selection process in a larger and more diverse study area than that of earlier studies. Using data on 650 residential burglaries and on approximately 500,000 residential properties in the Belgian province East Flanders, we consider a discrete spatial choice model of burglary target selection to establish which house-related attributes influence burglars' target selection process. Our findings demonstrate that terraced houses, houses without a garage, houses that have not been outfitted with a central heating and/or air-conditioning system and houses nearby burglars' residences are more likely to be selected. Overall, our analysis suggests that burglars rely on effort-related attributes to distinguish between targets while higher perceived rewards actually decrease the odds of a house being burglarized. Risk-related attributes are unimportant for burglars' target choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CO-OFFENDERS' CRIME LOCATION CHOICE: DO CO-OFFENDING GROUPS COMMIT CRIMES IN THEIR <i>SHARED</i> AWARENESS SPACE?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the influence of co-offending on crime location choice: the extent to which awareness spaces of co-offenders overlap and whether co-offended crimes are more likely committed in this overlap in awareness space. In total, 4,654 offenders from the greater The Hague region in The Netherlands were studied. They committed 6,283 crimes; of which, 3,612 were co-offended. The data were analysed using a discrete spatial choice model. Results show that most co-offending groups share 50 per cent or less of their awareness space. Offender groups are significantly more likely to commit crimes in areas known to multiple offenders in the group (the shared awareness space of the group) than in areas known to one offender or none of the offenders.

TI  - Modeling Micro-Level Crime Location Choice: Application of the Discrete Choice Framework to Crime at Places
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Discrete choice recently emerged as a new framework for analyzing criminal location decisions, but has thus far only been used to study the choice amongst large areas like census tracts. Because offenders also make target selection decisions at much lower levels of spatial aggregation, the present study analyzes the location choices of offenders at detailed spatial resolutions: the average unit of analysis is an area of only 18 residential units and 40 residents. This article reviews the discrete choice and spatial choice literature, justifies the use of geographic units this small, and argues that because small spatial units depend strongly on their environment, models are needed that take into account spatial interdependence. To illustrate these points, burglary location choice data from the Netherlands are analyzed with discrete choice models, including the spatial competition model.

TI  - The Importance of Importance Sampling: Exploring Methods of Sampling from Alternatives in Discrete Choice Models of Crime Location Choice
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives The burgeoning field of individual level crime location choice research has required increasingly large datasets to model complex relationships between the attributes of potential crime locations and offenders' choices. This study tests methods of sampling aiming to overcome computational challenges involved in the use of such large datasets. Methods Using police data on 38,120 residential and non-residential burglary, commercial and personal robbery and extra-familial sex offense locations and the offenders' pre-offense activity locations (e.g., home, family members' homes and prior crime locations), and in the context of the conditional logit formulation of the discrete spatial choice model, we tested a novel method for importance sampling of alternatives. The method over-samples potential crime locations near to offenders' activity locations that are more likely to be chosen for crime. We compared variants of this method with simple random sampling. Results Importance sampling produced results more consistent with those produced without sampling compared with simple random sampling, and provided considerable computational savings. There were strong relationships between the locations of offenders' prior criminal and non-criminal activities and their crime locations. Conclusions Importance sampling from alternatives is a relatively simple and effective method that enables future studies to use larger datasets (e.g., with more variables, wider study areas, or more granular spatial or spatio-temporal units) to yield greater insights into crime location choice. By examining non-residential burglary and sexual offenses, in New Zealand, the substantive results represent a novel contribution to the growing literature on offenders' spatial decision making.

TI  - "Location, Location, Location": Effects of Neighborhood and House Attributes on Burglars' Target Selection
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives To empirically test whether offenders consider environmental features at multiple spatial scales when selecting a target and examine the simultaneous effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on residential burglars' choice of residence to burglarize. Methods We combine data on 679 burglaries by 577 burglars committed between 2005 and 2014 with data on approximately 138,000 residences in 193 residential neighborhoods in Ghent, Belgium. Using a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the combined effect of neighborhood-level and residence-level attributes on burglars' target choice in a conditional logit model. Results Burglars prefer burglarizing residences in neighborhoods with lower residential density. Burglars also favor burglarizing detached residences, residences in single-unit buildings, and renter-occupied residences. Furthermore, burglars are more likely to target residences in neighborhoods that they previously and recently targeted for burglary, and residences nearby their home. We find significant cross-level interactions between neighborhood and residence attributes in burglary target selection. Conclusions Both area-level and target-level attributes are found to affect burglars' target choices. Our results offer support for theoretical accounts of burglary target selection that characterize it as being informed both by attributes of individual properties and attributes of the environment as well as combinations thereof. This spatial decision-making model implies that environmental information at multiple and increasingly finer scales of spatial resolution informs crime site selection.

TI  - Familiar Locations and Similar Activities: Examining the Contributions of Reliable and Relevant Knowledge in Offenders' Crime Location Choices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REVIEW
AB  - This paper examines the recently theorized roles of the reliability and relevance of offenders' knowledge of locations in their crime location choices. Using discrete choice models, we analyzed offenders' pre-offense activity locations from police data (home addresses, family members' home addresses, work, school, prior offenses, victimizations, non-crime incidents, and other police contacts) and 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offenses, in New Zealand. Offenders were most likely to offend where their prior activity locations indicated they had highly reliable and highly relevant knowledge-where they were both highly familiar with the area and had conducted similar activities-and less likely where offenders had less familiarity or less similar activities. The results support a recent extension of crime pattern theory and highlight the importance of including both reliability and relevance factors when modeling or predicting offenders' crime location choices.

TI  - Investigating the effect of people on the street and streetscape physical environment on the location choice of street theft crime offenders using street view images and a discrete spatial choice model
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - As street crime occurs in the street, it is reasonable to assume that the location choice of street crime offenders is affected by streetscape conditions and people on street. However, this issue has not been investigated by previous research, possibly because fine-grained streetscape data are hard to obtain. Traditional data-gathering methods like questionnaires, field surveys, and manual audits are inefficient and only applied to small areas. Social media and mobile phone data have recently been used to measure the ambient population. However, they are unable to distinguish between indoor and on-street people. To overcome these limitations, the present research applied an integrative deep learning algorithm combining an object detection network and a semantic segmentation network to extract on-street people and physical environment elements from fine-grained street view images (SVIs) in a large Chinese city. The extracted elements include fences, walls, windows, grass, sidewalk, and plants. Controlling the influence of residence-crime proximity, crime attractors, generators, detractors, and socioeconomic features, we constructed a discrete spatial choice model to investigate the influence of people on the street and the streetscape's physical environments on the location choice of street theft crime offenders. Results reveal an improvement in model performance after the streetscape variables are considered. Therefore, the streetscape context is essential for understanding offenders' preferences for crime locations. Specifically, the number of people on the street presents a significantly positive relationship with the offenders' preferences. Fences and plants have significant and positive effects on attracting criminals. Grasses and sidewalks negatively affect offenders' location choices. Walls and windows do not significantly affect criminals' crime location choices. Additionally, the associations between most control variables and offenders' preferences for crime locations conform to previous research findings. As the first attempt in combining SVIs, deep learning algorithms, and discrete spatial choice model, this study makes a contribution to the extant crime location choice literature.

TI  - An economy of choice? Terrorist decision-making and criminological rational choice theories reconsidered
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - This article first identifies the increasing centrality of practical and theoretical crime prevention approaches in tackling terrorism. Central features include the increased use of practical target hardening and rational choice models of trangressive action. Utilising cross-disciplinary research from criminology and terrorism studies, the efficacy of such strategies and their translation into counter-terrorism roles is assessed. It argues that such emphasis on opportunity structures and deterrence models is limited in its account of terrorist decision-making. This is because of many factors including the strong interplay between ideology, motivation and operational choice; the role of extraneous mitigating influences; and the need for theoretical approaches to accommodate evolving threats.

TI  - Security Theatrics: The Role of Visual Cues in Simulated Attacker Target Selection
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Visibly deterring potential adversaries is central to security risk assessment and planning operations within many agencies including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Many visible security elements are employed by TSA toward these goals. Questions remain whether these elements deter/displace attackers, and answers are elusive in these data-poor contexts. Using a novel adversarial exercise with a national sample, our paired conjoint experiment across visibly-changing aviation environments finds the majority of tested security infrastructure visibly deterred simulated adversaries. Canine officer presence deterred, biometric scanners induced, and queue density had no appreciable effect upon target selection. Our findings offer useful criminological insights, clear policy applications, and novel quantitative methods for assessing visible deterrent processes in limited data environments.

TI  - ROLE OF THE STREET NETWORK IN BURGLARS' SPATIAL DECISION-MAKING
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Explaining why crime is spatially concentrated has been a central theme of much criminological research. Although various theories focus on neighborhood social processes, environmental criminology asserts that the physical environment plays a central role by shaping people's activity patterns and the opportunities for crime. Here, we test theoretical expectations regarding the role of the road network in shaping the spatial distribution of crime and, in contrast to prior research, disentangle how it might influence offender awareness of criminal opportunities and the supply of ambient guardianship. With a mixed logit (discrete choice) model, we use data regarding (N = 459) residential burglaries (for the first time) to model offender spatial decision-making at the street segment level. Novel graph theory metrics are developed to estimate offender awareness of street segments and to estimate levels of ambient guardianship, distinguishing between local and nonlocal guardianship. As predicted by crime pattern theory, novel metrics concerning offender familiarity and effort were significant predictors of residential burglary location choices. And, in line with Newman's (1972) concept of defensible space, nonlocal (local) pedestrian traffic was found to be associated with an increase (decrease) in burglary risk. Our findings also demonstrate that taste preferences vary across offenders, which presents a challenge for future research to explain.

TI  - The usefulness of past crime data as an attractiveness index for residential burglars
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND OFFENDER PROFILING
AB  - This study examines the effects of neighbourhood attractiveness on the residential burglar's crime location choice process using a discrete choice model. We show that past crime data are an important index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness and can be combined with other attractiveness indices adapted from previous studies. We used data from 369 solved cases committed by 70 offenders and related these data to 1,134 areas (500m grid cells) in Sendai City, Japan. The results showed that residential burglars were attracted to the following potential locations for crimes: (a) areas in proximity to his or her own residence; (b) areas having many or at least a higher proportion of residential burglaries in the past; (c) areas having many residential units; and (d) areas having a higher proportion of single-family dwellings. The results confirm the validity of past crime data as an index of a neighbourhood's attractiveness for residential burglary.

TI  - Burglar Target Selection: A Cross-national Comparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This study builds on research undertaken by Bernasco and Nieuwbeerta and explores the generalizability of a theoretically derived offender target selection model in three cross-national study regions.
   Methods: Taking a discrete spatial choice approach, we estimate the impact of both environment- and offender-level factors on residential burglary placement in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Combining cleared burglary data from all study regions in a single statistical model, we make statistical comparisons between environments.
   Results: In all three study regions, the likelihood an offender selects an area for burglary is positively influenced by proximity to their home, the proportion of easily accessible targets, and the total number of targets available. Furthermore, in two of the three study regions, juvenile offenders under the legal driving age are significantly more influenced by target proximity than adult offenders. Post hoc tests indicate the magnitudes of these impacts vary significantly between study regions.
   Conclusions: While burglary target selection strategies are consistent with opportunity-based explanations of offending, the impact of environmental context is significant. As such, the approach undertaken in combining observations from multiple study regions may aid criminology scholars in assessing the generalizability of observed findings across multiple environments.

TI  - Modelling the spatial decision making of terrorists: The discrete choice approach
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This is the first study to apply a discrete choice model to understand terrorist spatial decision making. The findings support the proposition that terrorists make decisions that are guided by rationality and act in a similar way to urban criminals. A conditional logistic regression ascertained which characteristics increased the likelihood that an area would be selected as a target, using a dataset of attacks carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Belfast over a twenty-year period. An increase in distance from the terrorises home to the attack site decreased the likelihood that an area would be chosen and an area was more likely to be chosen if it contained a major road, police station or military base.

TI  - FAMILY MATTERS: EFFECTS OF FAMILY MEMBERS' RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON CRIME LOCATION CHOICE
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - According to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. Previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. However, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. This study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. Most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. It is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. Unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. The results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. Current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. Effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. The residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.

TI  - Location Choice of Snatching Offenders in Chennai City
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives We aim to test the applicability of crime pattern theory in an Indian urban context by assessing the effects of offender residence, prior offending locations and presence of crime generators and crime attractors on where offenders commit offences. Methods The data comprise 1573 police-recorded snatching offenses committed by 1152 identified offenders across the 201 wards of Chennai City. We used discrete crime location choice models to establish the choice criteria that snatching offenders use when they decide where to offend. Data on the locations retail businesses, religious and transportation facilities were collected using Google location services. Results The results confirm that snatching offenders prefer to target locations closer to their residence and that they prefer to re-offend at or near their prior offending locations. The findings also demonstrate that some but not all crime attractors and generators influence the location choice of snatching offenders. Conclusions By replicating in an Indian context previously published crime location choice findings, our findings support the generality of crime pattern theory. We discuss limitations and make suggestions for future investigations.

TI  - Graffiti Writers Choose Locations That Optimize Exposure
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - We investigate the spatial decision-making of graffiti writers when selecting target locations, examining how street segment characteristics influence exposure. Extending the rational choice perspective to expressive offending, we collected data through Systematic Social Observation in Ghent's city center in November 2017, covering 12,655 graffiti instances across 2,233 street segments. The SSO involved counting graffiti items and public facilities likely to attract crowds, and measuring street network centrality. Conditional logit models assessed the impact of these characteristics on graffiti location choices. Results show that street network centrality and the presence of bars, night shops, residential units, and schools significantly increased graffiti writers' preferences. Our findings suggest that graffiti writers aim to maximize exposure, highlighting the rational choice perspective's relevance for expressive offending.

TI  - Serendipity in Robbery Target Selection
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Drawing from interviews with active robbers (drug robbers and carjackers), this paper explores the role of serendipity in the robbery target selection process. Serendipity is defined as the art of finding something valuable while engrossed in something different (Roberts 1989). The discovery is unanticipated, unexpected and anomalous (Merton and Barber 2006) and may result from decidedly negative experiences. The extent to which robbery targets emerge through 'pure' serendipity or a more 'manufactured' variety sheds light on the conceptual interface between perception, need, opportunity and rational choice.

TI  - Do Street Robbery Location Choices Vary Over Time of Day or Day of Week? A Test in Chicago
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This article examines the hypothesis that in street robbery location choices, the importance of location attributes is conditional on the time of day and on the day of the week. Method: The hypothesis is assessed by estimating and comparing separate discrete location choice models for each two-hour time block of the day and for each day of the week. The spatial units of analysis are census blocks. Their relevant attributes include presence of various legal and illegal cash economies, presence of high schools, measures of accessibility, and distance from the offender's home. Results: The hypothesis is strongly rejected because for almost all census block attributes, their importance hardly depends on time of day or day of week. Only the effect of high schools in census blocks follows expectations, as its effect is only demonstrated at the times and on the days that schools are open. Conclusions: The results suggest that street robbers' location choices are not as strongly driven by spatial variations in immediate opportunities as has been suggested in previous studies. Rather, street robbers seem to perpetrate in the environs of cash economies and transit hubs most of the time irrespective of how many potential victims are around.

TI  - Learning where to offend: Effects of past on future burglary locations
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Informed by a growing literature on space-time patterns of repeat and near repeat burglary victimization, a crime location choice model was used to test whether burglars are attracted to areas they previously targeted. Using data in 3337 detected burglaries from one UK police force, and accounting for the distance to the offender's residence, and for other factors that make target areas attractive to burglars, it was demonstrated that burglars were more likely to commit a burglary in an area they had targeted before. This was particularly the case if the prior burglary was (very) recent. Areas near to those in which burglaries had been committed were also more likely to be selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Target selection in rapists: The role of environmental and contextual factors
T2  - AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR
AB  - Research on sex offenders has consistently emphasized the role of personal factors, while neglecting to consider the role of environmental and situational factors. The environmental perspective is primarily interested in crime, of which the offender is only one element, and the analysis begins with the location of the crimes, aiming at sorting out patterns in where, when and how crimes occur. Over the past few years there has been an increase in research on rapists' modus operandi, geographic decision-making, and target selection. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of the work that has been done in the field of rapists' target selection and hunting behavior, from an environmental standpoint. After a brief introduction and review of the theoretical models in environmental criminology, empirical studies are presented that investigate the geography of sex offending, offenders' hunting behavior and hunting process, geographic decision-making in target selection, and the influence of routine activities and offender type in target selection.

TI  - A Time for a Crime: Temporal Aspects of Repeat Offenders' Crime Location Choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This article examines to what extent repeat offenders' crime location choices are conditional on the timing of the offenses within the week and within the day. Extending crime pattern theory, we argue that offenders acquire time-specific rather than general knowledge of their environment. We hypothesize that offenders are more likely to offend in previously targeted areas at similar than at different days and times.
   Methods: Data on 12,639 offenses committed by 3,666 repeat offenders in the Netherlands are analyzed using discrete spatial choice models.
   Results: Offenders are most likely to offend in areas they already targeted before at similar parts of the week and similar times of the day, especially when the previous offense was committed on exactly the same weekend day or weekday and at the same hour of day. Offenders are less likely to return to previously targeted areas at different times of the week and day, and least likely to offend in areas they never targeted before. The effects were stronger for the same than for different types of crime.
   Conclusions: Assessing cyclic time patterns in crime location choice not only enhances our understanding of spatial criminal decision-making, but could also improve predictive policing methods.

TI  - A decision model for spatial site selection by criminals: A foundation for law enforcement decision support
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS
AB  - Crime analysis uses past crime data to predict future crime locations and times. Typically this analysis relies on hot spot models that show clusters of criminal events based on past locations of these events. It does not consider the decision making processes of criminals as human initiated events susceptible to analysis using spatial choice models. This paper analyzes criminal incidents as spatial choice processes. Spatial choice analysis can be used to discover the distribution of people's behaviors in space and time. Two adjusted spatial choice models that include models of decision making processes are presented. The comparison results show that adjusted spatial choice models provide efficient and accurate predictions of future crime patterns and can be used as the basis for a law enforcement decision support system. This paper also extends spatial choice modeling to include the class of problems where the decision makers' preferences are derived indirectly through incident reports rather than directly through survey instruments.

TI  - Testing Ecological Theories of Offender Spatial Decision Making Using a Discrete Choice Model
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Research demonstrates that crime is spatially concentrated. However, most research relies on information about where crimes occur, without reference to where offenders reside. This study examines how the characteristics of neighborhoods and their proximity to offender home locations affect offender spatial decision making. Using a discrete choice model and data for detected incidents of theft from vehicles (TFV), we test predictions from two theoretical perspectives-crime pattern and social disorganization theories. We demonstrate that offenders favor areas that are low in social cohesion and closer to their home, or other age-related activity nodes. For adult offenders, choices also appear to be influenced by how accessible a neighborhood is via the street network. The implications for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

AB  - Employing a quantitative technique on a large sample size (N=4996), this study aimed to understand spatial and temporal distribution of terrorist incidents in Istanbul, Turkey by a specific focus on targets. Rational choice, crime pattern, social disorganization, and routine activity theories covered the theoretical background. A number of determinants of terrorist incidents were tested on terrorists' target selection. Week days, type of offences, and type of terrorist organizations were found to have an important impact on target selection. Some terrorist groups, several types of offences and weekend days were found to be determinative on specific targets. Theories that were used to examine the relationship between target selection and other variables were statistically supported. In this regard, current study not only made an invaluable contribution to discussed theories in general, but also offered some practical solutions for law enforcement and public administration agencies.

TI  - Victims' Routine Activities and Sex Offenders' Target Selection Scripts: A Latent Class Analysis
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - This study investigates target selection scripts of 72 serial sex offenders who have committed a total of 361 sex crimes on stranger victims. Using latent class analysis, three target selection scripts were identified based on the victim's activities prior to the crime, each presenting two different tracks: (1) the Home script, which includes the (a) intrusion track and the (b) invited track, (2) the Outdoor script, which includes the (a) noncoercive track and the (b) coercive track, and (3) the Social script, which includes the (a) onsite track and the (b) off-site track. The scripts identified appeared to be used by both sexual aggressors of children and sexual aggressors of adults. In addition, a high proportion of crime switching was found among the identified scripts, with half of the 72 offenders switching scripts at least once. The theoretical relevance of these target selection scripts and their practical implications for situational crime prevention strategies are discussed.

TI  - BITING ONCE, TWICE: THE INFLUENCE OF PRIOR ON SUBSEQUENT CRIME LOCATION CHOICE
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Properties, victims, and locations previously targeted by offenders have an increased risk of being targeted again within a short time period. It has been suggested that often the same offenders are involved in these repeated events and, thus, that offenders' prior crime location choices influence their subsequent crime location choices. This article examines repeated crime location choices, testing the hypothesis that offenders are more likely to commit a crime in an area they previously targeted than in areas they did not target before. Unique data from four different data sources are used to study the crime location choices of 3,666 offenders who committed 12,639 offenses. The results indicate that prior crime locations strongly influence subsequent crime location choices. The effects of prior crime locations are larger if the crimes are frequent, if they are recent, if they are nearby, and if they are the same type of crime.

TI  - How do residential burglars select target areas? A new approach to the analysis of criminal location choice
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper introduces the discrete spatial choice approach to the study of criminal target choice. The approach is used to assess whether residential burglars are attracted to target areas that are affluent, accessible, and poorly guarded. In addition, the importance of these criteria is postulated to vary across burglars. The theory is tested using data on 548 residential burglaries, committed by 290 burglars from the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The likelihood of a neighbourhood's being selected for burglary is heightened by its ethnic heterogeneity, its percentage of single-family dwellings, and its proximity to where the offender lives. The results and prospects of the discrete spatial choice approach for spatial target selection research are discussed.

TI  - Do Migrant and Native Robbers Target Different Places?
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - The spatial pattern of crime has been a central theme of criminological research. Recently, the spatial variation in the crime location choice of offenders by different population groups has been gaining more attention. This study addresses the issue of whether the spatial distribution of migrant robbers' crime location choices is different from those of native robbers. Further, what factors contribute to such differences? Using a kernel density estimation and the discrete spatial choice modeling, we combine the offender data, POI data, and mobile phone data to explain the crime location choice of the street robbers who committed offenses and were arrested from 2012 to 2016 in ZG City, China. The results demonstrate that the crime location choices between migrant robbers and native robbers have obvious spatial differences. Migrant robbers tend to choose the labor-intensive industrial cluster, while native robbers prefer the old urban areas and urban villages. Wholesale markets, sports stadiums, transportation hubs, and subway stations only affect migrant robbers' crime location choices, but not native robbers'. These results may be attributable to the different spatial awareness between migrant robbers and native robbers. The implications of the findings for criminological theory and crime prevention are discussed.

TI  - Burglars blocked by barriers? The impact of physical and social barriers on residential burglars' target location choices in China
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Based on an offender spatial decision-making perspective, this burglary target location choice study aims to understand how physical and social barriers affect why residential burglars commit their crimes at particular locations in a major Chinese city. Using data on 3860 residential burglaries committed by 3772 burglars between January 2012 and June 2016 in ZG city, China, conditional logit (discrete choice) models were estimated to assess residential burglars' target location choice preferences. Three types of physical barriers were distinguished: major roads with access control, major roads without access control, and major rivers. Social barriers were constructed based on the Hukou system to reflect how local and nonlocal residents live segregated lives. Results show that residential burglars are less likely to target areas for which they have to cross a physical barrier and even less likely to do so if they have to cross multiple rivers. Local burglars are more likely to target communities with a majority of local residents than communities with a majority nonlocal population or a mixed community. Such a social barrier was less pronounced for nonlocal burglars. These findings add new insight that physical and social barriers affect, to various degrees, where residential burglars in China commit their crimes.

TI  - Measuring the perception of insecurity in low-income areas
T2  - EURE-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS URBANO REGIONALES
AB  - Urban safety has become a key issue for life in the city. A strategy that may positively affect quality of life is the urban design of public spaces; however, previous efforts have not been based on hard data, hampering a serious evaluation of alternative solutions. This work discusses the methodology and primary results of a study geared to quantify the perception of safety in low income areas, and bow this is affected by the spatial arrangement of neighborhoods. We are interested in quantifying the effect of spatial variables regarding the feelings of fear associated with the use of public space, with the objective to evaluate policies to improve security based on bard data rather than unproven speculation. We designed and implemented a stated preference survey to measure the relative perceptions of insecurity experienced by residents traveling through specific neighborhoods in Santiago. The relative importance of each variable was determined using flexible discrete choice models. Results suggest that the proposed approach could become an efficient technique for the evaluation of urban safety policies.

TI  - Exploring and Understanding Differences Between Deliberate and Impulsive Male and Female Burglars
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Relying on rational choice theory, we compare burglars' varying levels of offense planning to understand differences among types of burglars. Surveys were collected from a sample of incarcerated male and female burglars in three states. Participants answered questions detailing aspects of a burglary including motivations, target selection, deterrents, and techniques. Comparisons were made between 119 deliberate (32%) and 257 impulsive (68%) burglars. Deliberate burglars focused on obtaining cash, whereas impulsive burglars were more motivated by drug habits. Impulsive burglars were more easily dissuaded from a target when multiple obstacles are present. Burglars consider how many obstacles they may have to overcome, providing support for rational choice-based, situational crime prevention efforts. Differences in burglar motivation emerged and are discussed.

TI  - Ambient population and surveillance cameras: The guardianship role in street robbers' crime location choice
T2  - CITIES
AB  - Understanding how offenders choose a crime location is a classic criminological topic. However, previous research on offenders' crime location choice did not consider the impacts of ambient population and surveillance cameras on street robbery. Based on the literature, this study integrates ambient population and surveillance cameras data, from the perspective of guardianship. The discrete spatial choice modeling is used to test the impact of their guardianship role on street robbers' crime location choice, accounting for accessibility and proximity, crime attractors and generators, and social disorganization. The results demonstrate that ambient population and surveillance cameras have a significant hindering impact on street robbers' crime location choice, and they play a guardianship role in street robbers' criminal activities. In particular, we find that the guardianship effect of ambient population is greater than that of surveillance cameras. Further, the inclusion of ambient population and surveillance cameras increases the fitness of the model, which underscores the guardianship role of these two factors on street robbers' choice of location on committing a robbery. These findings can have important implications for the role of the ambient population and the deployment of surveillance cameras for crime reduction.

TI  - Modelling taste heterogeneity regarding offence location choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING
AB  - One of the central topics in crime research, and one in which discrete choice modelling has been relatively recently introduced, is the study of where offenders choose to commit crime. Since the introduction of this approach in 2003, it has become relatively popular and used in over 25 published studies covering a range of crime types and study areas. However, in most of these analyses the conditional logit has been used which assumes offenders are homogenous in their offence location preferences. This is despite various research finding offenders vary in their decision-making criteria. As such, while three recent studies (Townsley et al., 2016; Frith et al., 2017; Long et al., 2018) used the mixed logit and found some evidence of preference heterogeneity between offenders, there are still open questions regarding its nature. To this end, this study uses the latent class (and mixed and conditional logit) to examine the offence location choices of serious acquisitive crime offenders in York (UK). In particular, to understand how the spatial preferences differ between offenders and if there are any observable sources. Like the previous studies, this analysis identifies the presence of preference heterogeneity. This study also finds that the latent class and mixed logit equally fit the data though there are some differences in the results. These findings and other factors therefore raise questions for future crime location choice research regarding the appropriate model for these types of analyses and the true underlying nature of offender preferences.

TI  - Modelling a rational choice theory of criminal action: Subjective expected utilities, norms, and interactions
T2  - RATIONALITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Referring to classic rational choice models of criminal behaviour (Becker 1968), this paper presents an extended Subjective Expected Utility model that is more in line with the requirements of theorizing and empirical testing than former models. In our model, the decision of an actor is influenced by the expected utility of the crime and the norms that prohibit the delinquent action. It is suggested that there is an interaction between utility and norms which reflect different patterns of decision making leading to different probabilities for the occurrence of crimes. The model is tested by using survey data from Germany. Applying a new technique to uncover interaction effects reveals that in one pattern, internalized norms that label criminal action as not appropriate take effect instead of deliberation. In another pattern, the recognition that certain actions are connected to societal norms increases deliberation about costs and benefits of criminal behaviour.

TI  - Traveling Alone or Together? Neighborhood Context on Individual and Group Juvenile and Adult Burglary Decisions
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Neighborhood characteristics are important considerations when offenders make targeting decisions. Movement patterns among adults and juveniles vary widely, which impacts both the number of crime opportunities and the range of neighborhoods to which an offender is exposed. We test whether offending patterns among adult and juvenile burglars vary based on distances traveled, the types of neighborhoods targeted, and whether suspects acted alone or in a group. Using discrete choice modeling, we draw upon a unique sample of cleared burglaries in a representative city in the south over a 13-year period. Results show that adult burglars consistently travel further and are more sensitive to neighborhood conditions than their juvenile counterparts, but that group participation makes little difference in target decisions.

TI  - Radicalized Environmental Extremism and Situational Decision Making
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objective: In this study, we investigate extremists' appraisals of and sensitivity to perceived sanction risk during the commission of arson. We pay specific attention to the decision-making processes of extremists leading up to and during the offending opportunity. Methods: We examined data collected from self-reported communiques (n = 275) describing acts of arson committed by radical environmental extremists. Results: We found that extremists, like other criminals, are sensitive to situational factors that affect the certainty of apprehension. Additionally, extremists work to reduce the risk of detection by engaging in crime-specific risk management techniques prior to and during the offending opportunity. Conclusions: Analysis of the communiques is consistent with recent works on extremism, situational crime prevention, and restrictive deterrence. We discuss our findings in the context of rational choice and situational crime prevention theory and the advancement of preventative policies aimed at ideological and political crime.

TI  - WHERE OFFENDERS CHOOSE TO ATTACK: A DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL OF ROBBERIES IN CHICAGO
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Why do robbers choose a particular area to commit an offense ? Do they rob close to home ? Do they search for areas with suitable and attractive targets ? What keeps them away from certain areas ? To answer these questions, a model is developed of how robbers choose target areas. The model draws on various theoretical and empirical traditions, which include environmental criminology, journey to crime research, gang research, and social disorganization theory. Testing the model on cleared robbery cases in Chicago in the years 1996-1998, we demonstrate that robbery location choice is related to characteristics of target areas, to areas where offenders live, to joint characteristics of the resident and target areas, and to characteristics of the offenders themselves. The presence of illegal markets and other crime generators and crime attractors make areas attractive for robbers, whereas collective efficacy seems to keep them out. Distance as well as racial and ethnic segregation restrict the mobility of offenders.

TI  - WHAT MAKES LONG CRIME TRIPS WORTH UNDERTAKING? BALANCING COSTS AND BENEFITS IN BURGLARS' JOURNEY TO CRIME
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study taps into rational choice theory and scrutinizes the assumption that profit maximization and effort minimization govern decisions related to burglary behaviour and the journey to crime. It treats distance as one of the major costs in the burglary target selection process and uses community characteristics to gain insight into how the anticipation of particular benefits favours the incremental costs of long crime trips. Two thousand three hundred and eighty-seven burglary trips were extracted from police records and analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis. The journey-to-crime distance was found to increase when burglaries were committed in communities containing motorways, dense road networks, and being ethnically heterogeneous. The journey-to-crime distance was found to decrease when densely populated areas and communities with high clearance rates are targeted.

TI  - Do juvenile, young adult, and adult offenders target different places in the Chinese context?
T2  - CITIES
AB  - Offenders' crime location choices have been a central theme of criminological research. However, little is known about the difference by offenders' age in their crime location choices. Based on the perspective of offender spatial decision-making, this study explores the variation in crime location choices committed by street robbers in different age groups, and examines how age-related activity nodes, journey to crime, and social disorganization influence street robbers' location choices in a large Chinese city. This study examines 7860 street robberies committed by 4358 street robbers between 2012 and 2016 in ZG city, China. A conditional logit selection model was estimated to assess street robbers' crime location choice preferences. The results demonstrate that street robbers favor areas frequented by their age group, close to their residence, and low in social cohesion. Cybercafe acute accent s affect juvenile and young adult robbers' crime location choices, while transportation hubs impact those of young adult robbers and adult robbers. Schools affect all three age groups, but with a marginal age decay effect. Besides, the distance of journey to crime plays a significantly negative role in an offender's target choice, with the greatest impact in the youngest age group. These findings add insight to the clarification of the difference by age in offenders' crime location choices.

TI  - Auto Theft and Restrictive Deterrence
T2  - JUSTICE QUARTERLY
AB  - Although researchers have examined the attributes that make offenders more or less responsive to sanction threats, far less attention has centered on the manner in which responsiveness can lead to less detectible crime, or perhaps even more overall crime. Restrictive deterrence is the concept that explains this paradox. We explore it here using qualitative interviews with 35 active auto thieves. Findings suggest that auto thieves' restrictively deterrent decision-making strategies fell into three broad categories: discretionary target selection, normalcy illusions, and defiance. Discussion focuses on the data's conceptual implications for restrictive deterrence and offender decision-making.

TI  - Offender Searches and Crime Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - This article explores how several prominent theories explain how and where crime events occur. In particular, rational choice, lifestyle-routine activities, crime pattern, and multilevel opportunity theories are applied to offender searches for targets. Examples from qualitative and quantitative works are used to illustrate these theoretical concepts as applied to offenders' target selection and journey to crime. While both of these types of studies help to shed light on these topics, the ethnographic works have been particularly instrumental in understanding offenders' searches for targets. Finally, new directions or suggestions for future research are discussed, mainly the application to school shootings (or other mass murders) and online crimes.

TI  - Cleaning up your act: Forensic awareness as a detection avoidance strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: Although rational choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, there is a lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of "forensic awareness" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use.
   Methods: Factors influencing forensic awareness are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada.
   Results: Offenders exhibit less forensic awareness when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit forensic awareness.
   Conclusion: Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their forensic awareness and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene.

TI  - Expected utility, self-control, morality, and criminal probability
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - With data from random sample household surveys conducted simultaneously in major cities in Greece and in Russia, we evaluate the import of individuals' morality relative to expected utility and self-control in predicting criminal probability. In addition, we examine potential interactions among the three variables in predicting criminal propensity and compare their relative effects across the two samples. The results suggest that all three factors are important and mostly independent influences in explaining criminal probability. However, the estimated effects of morality are substantially stronger than those of either expected utility or self-control, and all three of these explanatory variables appear to be somewhat sensitive to cultural contexts. Overall, our findings confirm that morality plays a comparatively larger part in explaining conformity than is generally recognized by major contemporary theories, although the data cannot show whether morality is an element in rational decision making or represents a contrary "non-rational" element in accounting for human conduct.

TI  - Crime Feeds on Legal Activities: Daily Mobility Flows Help to Explain Thieves' Target Location Choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - ObjectiveAccording to routine activity theory and crime pattern theory, crime feeds on the legal routine activities of offenders and unguarded victims. Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.MethodsGeocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.ResultsAccounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender's home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.ConclusionsThe mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

TI  - Space-time dynamics of maritime piracy
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - The article examines space-time patterns of maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa. Using rational choice theory and optimal foraging theory as the theoretic frame, 6 years of recorded pirate attack data were used to test whether spatial and temporal attack patterns were independent. The results indicate evidence for a communicability of risk; that is, pirate activity clusters in space and time. Incorporating this finding means that forecasting of high-risk areas could be made more effective. The theoretical implication is that pirates' target selection appears to be consistent with other crime types, such as burglary, car crime and shootings. The results have implications for informing maritime piracy prevention and suppression efforts.

TI  - Relationships Between Offenders' Crime Locations and Different Prior Activity Locations as Recorded in Police Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the relationships between individual offenders' crime locations and their prior activity locations is important to enable individual level predictions to support crime prevention and investigation strategies. This study examined a wider range of crimes and activity locations than included in previous studies, to determine whether offenders are more likely to commit crime near some types of activity locations than others. Using discrete spatial choice models, we identified relationships between proximity to pre-crime activity locations recorded in a police database (e.g., offenders' homes, family members' homes, schools, prior crimes, and other police interactions) and the locations of 17,054 residential burglaries, 10,353 non-residential burglaries, 1,977 commercial robberies, 4,315 personal robberies, and 4,421 extra-familial sex offences in New Zealand. Offenders were generally more likely to commit crime closer to their activity locations than farther away, and closer to those visited more frequently (e.g., home versus family homes) or more likely to impart relevant knowledge about crime opportunities (e.g., prior crimes versus prior victim or witness locations). The observed patterns for different activity locations and crime types broadly support a recently proposed extension to crime pattern theory and illustrate the benefits of differentiating activity location and crime types when examining criminal spatial behaviour. The results have implications for offender risk assessment and management, and geographic profiling in police investigations.

TI  - A Statistical Threat Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS
AB  - Criminal gangs, insurgent groups, and terror networks demonstrate observable preferences in selecting the sites where they commit their crimes. Accordingly, police departments, military organizations, and intelligence agencies seek to learn these preferences and identify locations with a high probability of experiencing the particular event of interest in the near future. Often, such agencies are keen not just to predict the spatial pattern of future events but even more importantly to conduct threat assessments of particular criminal gangs or insurgent groups. These threat assessments include identifying where each of the various groups presents the greatest threat to the community, what the most likely targets are for each criminal group, what makes one location more likely to experience an attack than another, and how to most efficiently allocate resources to address the specific threats to the community. Previous research has demonstrated that applying multivariate prediction models to relate features in an area to the occurrence of crimes offers an improvement in predictive performance over traditional methods of hot-spot analysis. This paper introduces the application of multilevel modeling to these multivariate spatial choice models, demonstrating that it is possible to significantly improve the predictive performance of the spatial choice models for individual groups and leverage that information to provide improved threat assessments of the criminal elements in a given geographic area.

TI  - To bike or not to bike: Exploring cycling for commuting and non-commuting in Bangladesh
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES
AB  - In recent years, Bangladesh has started moving its transportation vision towards achieving sustainability goals such as increasing bicycle infrastructure, sidewalks, reducing air pollution, etc. To contribute to the ongoing discussion, we explored factors that influence the use of bicycles for different trip purposes in Rajshahi, a medium-sized city in Bangladesh. A face-to-face household survey was conducted to collect individuals' sociodemographic characteristics, their travel patterns for different trip purposes, and perceptions of the built environment. We developed four Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) models to understand the influence of latent perceptions on bicycling for commuting and non-commuting (i.e., grocery shopping, going for tea, and recreational) trips. The analysis indicates that women are more likely to choose a bike for commuting trips but are less likely to use bikes for recreational trips. The results also show that the choice of commuting by bicycle is positively associated with commuting distance and negatively associated with residential land use. Walkability perception has a significant positive association with the choice of bikes for commuting and non-commuting trips. Road safety perception for active travel is positively associated with bike choice for recreational trips, and crime perception of the neighborhood is negatively associated with bike choice for grocery trips. The results from this study will be helpful for policymakers to understand and improve the built environment to attract individuals towards bike use.

TI  - A descriptive model of the hunting process of serial sex offenders: A rational choice perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE
AB  - A rational choice theory approach was used to analyze the offense behavior of serial sex offenders. Qualitative data were obtained through the descriptions of the crimes provided by 69 serial sex offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution. Based on the offenders' accounts, a descriptive model specific to the hunting process was identified. This model contained the following nine phases: offender and victim routine activities, choice of hunting ground, victim selection, method of approach, attack location choice, method to bring the victim to the crime site, crime location choice, method to commit the crime, and the victim release location choice. The model is discussed according to existing research on serial sex offenders and environmental criminology. Implications for clinical practice, crime prevention, offender profiling, and future studies are discussed.

TI  - Sweeter than honey: Are Gmail accounts associated with greater rewards at a higher risk of hijacking?
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS
AB  - Objectives: This study investigates the effect of advertised rewards in credential leaks on the likelihood and speed of account hijacking. Methods: In an online field experiment, we created 176 honey Gmail accounts and randomly assigned them to eight different posts containing account credential leaks. We used a 2 x 2 experimental design, manipulating two key variables within the post titles: the number of accounts (5 K or 1.5 M) and the promise of access to additional platforms (absent or present). We then monitored the accounts for any subsequent activity. Results: Our findings indicate that the promise of access to additional platforms increased the likelihood and speed of an attempted access. Only 12 accounts were fully accessed, however, because most hijackers did not complete the second-factor authentication (2FA) process required for gaining full access. It seems that the 2FA acted as a deterrent to complete Gmail account hijacking. Conclusions: The study aligns with the rational choice perspective of crime, showing that the prospect of greater rewards leads to more attempted account accesses.

TI  - Red Media, Blue Media: Evidence of Ideological Selectivity in Media Use
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - We show that the demand for news varies with the perceived affinity of the news organization to the consumer's political preferences. In an experimental setting, conservatives and Republicans preferred to read news reports attributed to Fox News and to avoid news from CNN and NPR. Democrats and liberals exhibited exactly the opposite syndrome-dividing their attention equally between CNN and NPR, but avoiding Fox News. This pattern of selective exposure based on partisan affinity held not only for news coverage of controversial issues but also for relatively "soft'' subjects such as crime and travel. The tendency to select news based on anticipated agreement was also strengthened among more politically engaged partisans. Overall, these results suggest that the further proliferation of new media and enhanced media choices may contribute to the further polarization of the news audience.

TI  - The Unusual Case of Sexual Homicide Against Males: Comparisons and Classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the specificities of sexual homicides involving male victims. First, this study aims to identify characteristics specific to SH involving male victims by comparing them to SH involving female victims and determine whether rational choice approach and routine activities theories are useful to explain the crime-commission process. Second, this study aims to provide the first empirical classification of SH involving male victims. The sample used in this research comes from the Sexual Homicide International Database (SHIelD) including 662 cases of cases-100 cases involving male victims and 552 involving female victims. Bivariate and multivariate analysis are performed to examine the differences between the two groups and latent class analysis is used to generate an empirical classification of cases involving male victims. Findings indicate the victim's gender plays an important role in the different choices made by sexual homicide offenders of male victims to successfully complete their crime. They adapted their crime-commission process to overcome the risks associated with a physical confrontation with a male victim (i.e., target selection, approach strategy, method of killing). Classification analysis suggests that it exists three different types of sexual murderers assaulting male victims: the robber sexual murderer, the sadistic sexual murderer, and the pedophile murderer. This research proposes the first empirical typology of sexual homicide involving male victims and provides both a true picture of the reality and a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

TI  - Determinants of residential location choice: How important are local public goods in attracting homeowners to central city locations?
T2  - JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
CP  - Symposium on State and Local Government Regulations and Economic Development
AB  - A hybrid conditional logit choice model is estimated using data on the characteristics and destination of homeowners who engaged in intrametropolitan moves among 17 school districts within the Columbus, Ohio area in 1995. The model is used to test the relative influence of local fiscal and public goods versus household-level characteristics in determining household location choices across central city and suburban school districts. Results provide evidence of both a "natural evolution" of households to the suburbs, due to job location, residential filtering, and household income and lifecycle effects, and "flight from blight," due to lower school quality, higher crime levels, and lower average income levels in the city. In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that school quality exerts the strongest influence: a 1-percent increase in the school quality of the city district increases the probability of choosing a city residence by 3.7 percent. In contrast, the effects of household income and other individual characteristics are relatively modest. The findings provide support for a "flight from blight" suburbanization process that is dominated by differences in neighborhood quality between the city and suburbs. An implication is that investments that promote central city development and reduce suburbanization are justified on efficiency grounds if negative externalities are generated by increased concentration of poverty, crime, and low school quality.

TI  - The impact of emotion on offender decision-making: advancing our understanding through virtual re-enactment
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY CRIME & LAW
AB  - This article reviews approaches to the study of emotion in offender decision-making research. It then draws together theoretical models from psychology and neuroscience to propose an innovative method with which to move this field forward. Theories in this field have long called for a deeper understanding of the impact of emotion on criminal behaviour. While recent research has made some fruitful gains, it has been hampered by an overly narrow view of emotion and by limited methodologies. Using the expertise paradigm as an interdisciplinary and integrative framework, this article advocates incorporating into it established models of emotional experience from affective neuroscience to aid this endeavour. It further argues that employing the currently evolving virtual enactment method as a measurement tool will provide an unparalleled insight into the study of emotion as it unfolds during the offending act. Both environmental crime prevention and desistance from crime are likely to benefit considerably as a result.

TI  - Public transportation and fear of crime at BRT Systems: Approaching to the case of Barranquilla (Colombia) through integrated choice and latent variable models
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - Security perception and Fear of Crime (FoC) in urban scenarios have the potential to affect travel behavior, changing people's travel choices and patterns. In this sense, the feeling of being "safe" or "at-risk" in public transportation not only depends on observable factors like illumination, travel companionship or transport crowding, but also on unobservable individual-specific latent attributes, among which fear of crime constitutes a major issue to consider in transport security policy-making. This study aimed to describe the relationships among sociodemographic features, travel situations, system-design features, and the Fear of Crime at three different locations (buses, bus stops, and stations) of the BRT system of Barranquilla (Colombia). Using an image-based survey applied in Barranquilla, data was collected from a full-sample of 500 adult users (64% females and 36% males) of the system. It was estimated a hybrid choice model to include location-based fear of crime in public transportation perception of risk, along with attributes related to (e.g.) surveillance, crowding, time of the day, and companionship. The relation between fear of crime and perception of security in public transportation is negative and highly significant. FoC inside the bus has the highest negative effect on the utility, followed by bus stops and BRT Stations, for which it remains non-significant. Gender (being a female user) was the strongest FoC predictor. Moreover, it was found that the higher is the user's income, the lower is the fear of crime reported for each one of these three types of location. Overall, the inclusion of the fear of crime perception in the estimation of the hybrid choice model enhances the model fit. Also, the user-related findings of this study at different locations provide a better understanding of the decision-making process and the predictors of fear of crime in BRT systems.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Terrorist Attacks by ETA 1970 to 2007
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Rational choice perspectives maintain that seemingly irrational behavior on the part of terrorist organizations may nevertheless reflect strategic planning. In this paper we examine spatial and temporal patterns of terrorist attacks by the Spanish group ETA between 1970 and 2007. Our analysis is guided by a public announcement by ETA in 1978 that the group would shift from emphasizing attacks in the Basque territory to instead launch attacks more widely in the hopes of exhausting the Spanish government and forcing it to abandon the Basque territory. This announcement suggests that prior to the end of 1978 ETA attacks were based mostly on controlling territory in the Basque region that they hoped to rule; and after 1978 the organization decided to instead undertake a prolonged war of attrition. Accordingly, we argue that before the end of 1978 ETA was mostly perpetrating control attacks (attacking only within the Basque territories) and that the diffusion of attacks between provinces was mostly contagious (spreading contiguously). After the 1978 proclamation, we argue that the attack strategy shifted toward attrition (attacking in areas outside of the Basque territories) and that the attacks were more likely to diffuse hierarchically (spreading to more distant locations). As predicted, we find that after ETA moved toward a more attrition based attack strategy, subsequent attacks were significantly more likely to occur outside the Basque region and to target non-adjacent regions (consistent with hierarchical diffusion). We also find that hierarchical diffusion was more common when a longer time elapsed between attacks (a likely consequence of the fact that more distant attacks require more resources and planning) and that attacks against Madrid were unlikely to be followed immediately by more attacks on Madrid or surrounding provinces. After ETA announced a shift in policy, they maintained a highly dispersed attack strategy even during their period of decline. Using information about where and when prior attacks occurred could provide useful information for policy makers countering groups like ETA.

TI  - Learning on the job: Studying expertise in residential burglars using virtual environments*
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - In this article, we describe a quasi-experiment in which experienced incarcerated burglars (n = 56), other offenders (n = 50), and nonoffenders (n = 55) undertook a mock burglary within a virtual neighborhood. We draw from the cognitive psychology literature on expertise and apply it to offending behavior, demonstrating synergy with rational choice perspectives, yet extending them in several respects. Our principal goal was to carry out the first robust test of expertise in offenders by having these groups undertake a burglary in a fully fledged reenactment of a crime in a virtual environment. Our findings indicate that the virtual environment successfully reinstated the context of the crime showing clear differences in the decision making of burglars compared with other groups in ways commensurate with expertise in other behavioral domains. Specifically, burglars scoped the neighborhood more thoroughly, spent more time in the high-value areas of the crime scene while traveling less distance there, and targeted different goods from the comparison groups. The level of detail in the data generated sheds new light on the cognitive processes and actions of burglars and how they "learn on the job." Implications for criminal decision-making perspectives and psychological theories of expertise are discussed.

TI  - Is There an "Expert" Stranger Rapist?
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - The concept of expertise applied to the criminal context assumes that offenders are driven by the abilities to both maximize the payoffs and minimize the risks associated with the crime-commission. This study tested the articulation between these two types of decisions taken by stranger rapists to successfully commit their crime. Specifically, this study aims to identify whether offenders whose modus operandi is indicative of criminal expertise are more likely to use forensic awareness strategies. Multivariate analyses conducted on 1,551 cases showed that stranger rapists who adopted behaviors indicative of expertise were more likely to use forensic awareness strategies to decrease the risk of police detection. Mixed associations were found between the number of forensic awareness strategies and their nature (i.e., protecting identity vs. destroying evidence) and rapists' expertise, thus leading to a four-type theoretical classification of expertise: novice, bold, opportunistic, and expert stranger rapists. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - Spatial patterns of serial murder: An analysis of disposal site location choice
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW
AB  - Although the murders committed by serial killers may not be considered rational, there is growing evidence that the locations in which they commit their crimes maybe guided by an implicit, if limited rationality.
   The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time.
   Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities.

Using data on nearly 13,000 robberies, on the approximately 18,000 offenders involved in these robberies, and on the nearly 25,000 census blocks in the city of Chicago, we utilize the discrete choice framework to assess which criteria motivate the location decisions of street robbers. We demonstrate that they attack near their own homes, on easily accessible blocks, where legal and illegal cash economies are present, and that these effects spill over to adjacent blocks.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Arson
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterning of arson incidents in a large urban county.
   Methods: Using multiyear geocoded crime data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office (2005 to 2012), arson incidents are analyzed for significant space-time interaction using the Monte Carlo simulation-based Knox method, originally developed for epidemiology research. Several additional contrasts are presented according to situational and routine activities factors that may be implicated in target selection and guardianship efficacy.
   Results: Evidence illustrates that arson generally exhibits enhanced likelihood of near repeat follow-up incidents in close spatial and temporal proximity to an initiating event. Also, spatiotemporal patterns for arson exhibit systematic differences when contrasting subtypes including residential versus non-residential, daytime versus nighttime, and weekday versus weekend arsons.
   Conclusions: Comparatively little empirical research has been published in criminology journals concerning this invisible Uniform Crime Report index crime. This study provides a theoretically informed, aggregate-level examination of trends and patterns for arson in an urban environment. Results may aid in inductive theory building as well as efforts to investigate and prevent arson.

TI  - TARGET CHOICE DURING EXTREME EVENTS: A DISCRETE SPATIAL CHOICE MODEL OF THE 2011 LONDON RIOTS
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Riots are extreme events, and much of the early research on rioting suggested that the decision making of rioters was far from rational and could only be understood from the perspective of a collective mind. In the current study, we derive and test a set of expectations regarding rioter spatial decision making developed from theories originally intended to explain patterns of urban crime when law and order prevailcrime pattern and social disorganization theoryand consider theories of collective behavior and contagion. To do this, we use data for all riot-related incidents that occurred in London in August 2011 that were detected by the police. Unlike most studies of victimization, we use a random utility model to examine simultaneously how the features of the destinations selected by rioters, the origins of their journeys, and the characteristics of the offenders influence offender spatial decision making. The results demonstrate that rioter target choices were far from random and provide support for all three types of theory, but for crime pattern theory in particular. For example, rioters were more likely to engage in the disorder close to their home location and to select areas that contained routine activity nodes and transport hubs, and they were less likely to cross the Thames River. In terms of contagion, rioters were found to be more likely to target areas that had experienced rioting in the previous 24 hours. From a policy perspective, the findings provide insight into the types of areas that may be most vulnerable during riots and why this is the case, and when particular areas are likely to be at an elevated risk of this type of disorder.

TI  - Journey to Grow: Linking Process to Outcome in Target Site Selection for Cannabis Cultivation
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: To test whether there is a relationship between characteristics of the journey to an outdoor cannabis cultivation site and the total number of plants grown. Methods: Spatial data on the location of a sample of 132 cultivation sites derived from aerial detection policing efforts is used. TwoStep cluster analysis is employed to derive profiles of cultivation sites based on three measures of distance (i.e., distance to road, to water, and elevation) and regression analysis is used to examine their implications for the number of plants grown. Results: Four types of cultivation sites are found: prime, rugged, dry, and remote. Prime sites are fairly close to roads and water sources and are at relatively low elevation. They grow the greatest number of plants (mean = 171). Low elevation is the single most important factor correlate of operation size. Further, remote sites (both further from road and at higher elevation) tend to be larger. Conclusions: A majority of growers are capable of identifying "prime" locations in which the tradeoff between rewards and security appears to be maximized. This study is limited by the fact that there was no information available on the offenders themselves. Future research should employ interviews to clarify decision-making processes.

TI  - DECISION MAKING IN THE CRIME COMMISSION PROCESS Comparing Rapists, Child Molesters, and Victim-Crossover Sex Offenders
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Based on a rational choice approach, this study compares the decision making involved in the crime commission process of rapists (n = 30), child molesters (n = 17), and victim-crossover sex offenders (n = 22). Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i.e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i.e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i.e., event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
CP  - 14th Annual Environmental Criminology and Crime Analysis Meeting
AB  - Previous research evaluating burglars' offending location choices has produced mixed findings about the influence of physical barriers and connectors on offender movement patterns. Consequently, this article utilises the discrete spatial choice approach to formally evaluate the impact of barriers and connectors on residential burglars' macro-level offending location choices. Data from Perth, Western Australia, demonstrated that physical barriers and connectors exert significant influence on offender decision-making at this level, and that the influence of impermeable barriers increases with proximity of these obstacles to the offender's point of origin. These findings provide formalised evidence for the independent importance of physical barriers and connectors in offender movement and are discussed with respect to current environmental criminology theory.

TI  - How do offenders choose where to offend? Perspectives from animal foraging
T2  - LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Purpose. Research suggests that offender spatial decision-making is not random. However, little is known about if or how offences in a series influence where an offender will target next. Drawing on concepts and empirical findings from environmental criminology and the ecology literature, in this article I consider what spatial patterns might be expected in the sequential crimes committed by serial offenders and provide an empirical example.
   Methods. Data for detected burglars are analysed and patterns in the inter-event distances for sequential offences compared with those signatures typically associated with three types of foraging behaviour - central place foraging, Brownian walks and Levy walks. Analyses involve the use of a Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected distribution for central place foraging, while the observed probability density function of sequential inter-event distances is compared to exponential and power law distributions to test for evidence of Brownian and Levy walks, respectively.
   Results. Analyses suggest that patterns in burglar sequential inter-event distances cannot be explained by a simple central place foraging strategy. The distribution of sequential inter-event distances is found to be consistent with both Brownian and Levy walks.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that there are regularities in the sequential spatial choices made by offenders, and that these are similar to those observed across species. Reasons for why there is evidence of both Brownian and Levy walks are discussed. The implications of the findings for forensic techniques such as crime linkage analysis, geographic offender profiling and crime forecasting are discussed.

TI  - A framework for estimating crime location choice based on awareness space
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - This paper extends Crime Pattern Theory, proposing a theoretical framework which aims to explain how offenders' previous routine activity locations influence their future offence locations. The framework draws on studies of individual level crime location choice and location choice in non-criminal contexts, to identify attributes of prior activities associated with the selection of the location for future crime. We group these attributes into two proposed mechanisms: reliability and relevance. Offenders are more likely to commit crime where they have reliable knowledge that is relevant to the particular crime. The perceived reliability of offenders' knowledge about a potential crime location is affected by the frequency, recency and duration of their prior activities in that location. Relevance reflects knowledge of a potential crime location's crime opportunities and is affected by the type of behaviour, type of location and timing of prior activities in that location. We apply the framework to generate testable hypotheses to guide future studies of crime location choice and suggest directions for further theoretical and empirical work. Understanding crime location choice using this framework could also help inform policing investigations and crime prevention strategies.

TI  - Right place, right time? Making crime pattern theory time-specific
T2  - CRIME SCIENCE
AB  - Objectives Crime pattern theory and the related empirical research have remained rather a-temporal, as if the timing of routine activities and crime plays no role. Building on previous geography of crime research, we extend crime pattern theory and propose that an offender's spatial knowledge acquired during daily routine activities is not equally applicable to all times of day. Methods We put this extended theory to a first empirical test by applying a discrete spatial choice model to detailed information from the Netherlands on 71 offences committed by 30 offenders collected through a unique online survey instrument. The offenders reported on their most important activity nodes and offence locations over the past year, as well as the specific times they regularly visited these locations. Results The results show that almost 40% of the offences are committed within the neighbourhoods of offenders' activity nodes, increasing to 85% when including first-, second- and third-order neighbourhoods. Though not statistically significant in our small sample, the results further suggest that offenders are more likely to commit crime in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at the same time of day than in neighbourhoods they have regularly visited at different times of day. Conclusion Our extension of crime pattern theory is only tentatively supported. We argue for replication research with larger samples before any firm conclusions are warranted.

TI  - Where Do Dealers Solicit Customers and Sell Them Drugs? A Micro-Level Multiple Method Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - According to a rational choice theory of crime location choice, offenders commit crimes at locations where the mix of expected rewards and costs is optimal. The present study applied this general theory to a very specific crimeillicit drug dealing in an open air drug marketand tested it in the Red Light District and its neighboring area in downtown Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data were collected in interviews with 50 dealers of illicit drugs and through systematic observations of the 262 street segments in the study area. It was expected that dealers prefer locations where expected earnings relative to invested time and effort is high and where the risk of apprehension is low. The quantitative findings seem to confirm that dealers go to places where the likelihood of successfully soliciting customers is high, but no evidence is found that they avoid places with informal or formal social control. Qualitative data collected in the same interviews reveal that dealers view social control as a nuisance and risk that can be evaded. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for criminological theory and research methods.

TI  - An application of the rational choice approach to the offending process of sex offenders: A closer look at the decision-making
T2  - SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB  - Although the study of both offense processes and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender's decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and forensic awareness of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice). Results show that sex offenders, even if traditionally described as "irrational" and impulsive individuals, are capable, up to a certain point, of an analysis of the costs/benefits related to their actions. Moreover, results emphasize the important role of situational factors, such as victim resistance, on the decision-making process of sex offenders. Implications of the results are briefly discussed in regard of clinical practice and crime prevention.

TI  - Reconciling Emotion and Rational Choice: Negativistic Auto Theft, Consequence Irrelevance, and the Seduction of Destruction
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: We explore negativism in the context of auto theft and examine its broader phenomenological significance for Rational Choice Theory. Methods: Data were drawn from qualitative, in-depth interviews with 35 active auto thieves operating out of a large Midwestern U.S. city. Results: Negativistic offending is malicious, spiteful, and/or destructive conduct whose purpose is typically more hedonic (i.e., short-term gratification) than instrumental (i.e., resource-generating) or normative (i.e., moralistic). It is made possible by the notion of ownership without responsibility: Offenders controlled a vehicle that was not theirs, promoting consequence irrelevance which in turn unleashed reckless conduct. Conclusions: Consequence irrelevance clarifies negativism's logic and permits linkage between affect-based and rational choice decision-making models.

TI  - Measuring the Impact of Negative Demand Shocks on Car Dealer Networks
T2  - MARKETING SCIENCE
AB  - The goal of this paper is to study the behavior of consumers, dealers, and manufacturers in the car sector and present an approach that can be used by managers and policy makers to investigate the impact of significant demand shocks on profits, prices, and dealer networks. More specifically, we investigate consumer demand, substitution patterns, and price decisions across different cars and dealer locations to identify dealerships with low margins or high fixed costs and measure the value of closing down dealerships for manufacturers. We apply our model empirically to the San Diego area using a transactional data set with information about the locations of dealers and consumers, as well as manufacturer and retail prices. We find strong consumer disutility for travel and find that dealers have local demand areas that are shared with a small set of competitors. We show that a reduction of market demand by 30% over two years, similar to the economic crisis of 2008-2009, results in an annual drop in prices of approximately 11%. We discuss this price drop in the context of the 2009 federal policy measure known as the Car Allowance Rebate System program. We compare predictions and actual dealership closings in the General Motors and Chrysler dealer networks as an application of our approach.

TI  - Do warnings deter rather than produce more sophisticated malingering?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Following Youngjohn, Lees-Haley, and Binder's (1999) comment on Johnson and Lesniak-Karpiak's (1997) study that warnings lead to more subtle malingering, researchers have sought to better understand warning effects. However, such studies have been largely atheoretical and may have confounded warning and coaching. This study examined the effect on malingering of a warning that was based on criminological-sociological concepts derived from the rational choice model of deterrence theory. A total of 78 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unwarned simulator group, or one of two warned simulator groups. The warning groups comprised low- and high-level conditions depending on warning intensity. Simulator participants received no coaching about how to fake tests. Outcome variables were scores derived from the Test of Memory Malingering and Wechsler Memory Scale-III. When the rate of malingering was compared across the four groups, a high-level warning effect was found such that warned participants were significantly less likely to exaggerate than unwarned simulators. In an exploratory follow-up analysis, the warned groups were divided into those who reported malingering and those who did not report malingering, and the performance of these groups was compared to that of unwarned simulators and controls. Using this approach, results showed that participants who were deterred from malingering by warning performed no worse than controls. However, on a small number of tests, self-reported malingerers in the low-level warning group appeared less impaired than unwarned simulators. This pattern was not observed in the high-level warning condition. Although cautious interpretation of findings is necessitated by the exploratory nature of some analyses, overall results suggest that using a carefully designed warning may be useful for reducing the rate of malingering. The combination of some noteworthy effect sizes, despite low power and the small size of some groups, suggests that further investigation of the effects of warnings needs to continue to determine their effect more fully.

TI  - Examining the role of amenities in migration decisions: A structural estimation approach
T2  - PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - I develop a discrete choice dynamic migration model to examine the importance of amenity values in immigrants' migration decisions. The model accounts for differentials in both wages and location-specific amenities as determinants of migration decisions, and the size of migrants' networks is allowed to influence the value of the US location choice as well. By estimating the model using panel data from the Mexican Migration Project, I find that Mexican migrants place substantial value on amenities in the United States, which are shown to fall precipitously with migrants' age. Simulation results from policy experiments indicate that Mexican immigrants are more responsive to a policy that reduces the amenity values related to unauthorized US residence than to an increase in the number of border patrol officers.

TI  - Consistency and specificity in burglars who commit prolific residential burglary: Testing the core assumptions underpinning behavioural crime linkage
T2  - LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - PurposeBehavioural crime linkage is underpinned by two assumptions: (a) that offenders exhibit some degree of consistency in the way they commit offences (their modus operandi [MO]); and, (b) that offenders can be differentiated on the basis of their offence behaviour. The majority of existing studies sample at most three crimes from an offender's series of detected crimes and do not examine whether patterns differ across offenders. Here, we examine patterns observed across the entire detected series of each sampled offender, and assess how homogeneous patterns are across offenders.
   MethodsUsing a non-parametric resampling approach, we analyse the entire crime series of 153 prolific burglars to determine if they exhibit consistency and specificity in the way they commit offences.
   ResultsFindings suggest that offenders exhibit consistency in the way they commit offences. With respect to specificity, our results suggest that patterns are not homogeneous across offenders or the type of MO considered - some offenders exhibit more specificity than do others, and offenders are more distinctive for some aspects of their MO (particularly spatial choices) than they are for others.
   ConclusionsThe findings provide support for the underlying principles of crime linkage, but suggest that some aspects of an offender's MO either conform to a common preference, or are perhaps more influenced by situational factors than stable scripted preferences. That some offenders fail to demonstrate sufficient specificity for accurate linkage suggests that identifying which crimes are likely to be the work of offenders who display more specificity a priori constitutes one challenge for future research of this kind.

TI  - CRIME DIVERSITY
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Large geographic areas should host a greater diversity of crime compared with small geographic areas. This proposition is reasonable given that larger geographic areas should not only support more crime but also contain a greater diversity of criminogenic settings. This article uses a neutral model to characterize crime richness as a function of area. The model starts with two neutral assumptions: 1) that all environments are statistically equivalent and exert no influence on what types of crimes occur there; and 2) that different crime types occur independently of one another. The model produces rigorous predictions for the mean and variance in crime richness with increasing area. Tests of the model against a sample of 172,055 crimes occurring in Los Angeles during the year 2013 are qualitatively consistent with neutral expectations. The model is made quantitatively consistent by constant scaling. Resampling experiments show that at most 20 percent of the mean crime richness is attributable to nonrandom clustering and assortment of crime types. A modified neutral model allowing for variation crime concentration is consistent with observed variance in crime richness. The results suggest that very general and largely neutral laws may be driving crime diversity in space.

TI  - To share or not to share? Revealing determinants of individuals' willingness to share rides through a big data approach
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Ridesplitting has been widely recognised as a promising mobility mode for sustainable trans-portation, but its success largely depends on a sufficient number of passengers who are willing to share their rides. To uncover the determinants of willingness to share (WTS), prior studies typically relied on either individual-level survey-based or aggregate-level data-driven methods. To combine the former's strength in capturing individual choice preferences and the latter's advantage in utilising available multi-source big data, this study proposes a big data approach to modelling individual choices between the solo and shared options for each trip. To reconstruct the choice process, we leverage large-scale real-world trip records and propose a learning framework to not only retrieve the trip time and fare of the chosen option (solo or shared), but also impute the likely time and fare of the alternative option. These reconstructed trip attributes are then integrated with the sociodemographic, built environment and traffic features from other data sources. Finally, all these variables are fed into a random coefficient logit model to reveal passengers' ridesplitting preferences. Through a case study of Manhattan, New York City, we reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of WTS and its determinants. Results show that WTS varies greatly across space and time. The time-fare trade-off is identified as the most essential factor, with the value of time revealed to be about $28-36/h. WTS decreases with longer trip distance/commuting time/distance to the urban centre, lower road speed, and higher speed fluctuation/bus station/crime density, but increases with a higher proportion of middle-class/female/young residents, residential land use and metro station. The proposed methodology can be used to explain and monitor WTS in a cost-effective way, complementing traditional survey-based methods to better design and promote ridesplitting services.

TI  - Outbound offending: The journey to crime and crime sprees
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Studies on crime and mobility primarily focus on local crime patterns. The city has long played an important role, whether analysing the offence or the offender. This paper goes beyond city boundaries and discusses 'outbound offenders', whose crime trips start in a city, but end outside. It is argued that a substantial proportion of crime trips follow this pattern, indicating that areas other than cities also provide interesting opportunities for property crime. We link outbound offending to a number of features that may explain crime travelling, including the target's features and offender/offence features. We find that outbound offending mostly occurs towards affluent target regions and near motorways, as such confirming findings from previous research. We also find crime sprees to be indicative for mobile offending. Thus, mobile property offenders tend to compensate for travelled distances, not only by targeting affluent areas and using fast transportation means, but also by committing several successive offences, hereby reducing their relative transportation cost for each offence.

TI  - Predicting cannabis cultivation on national forests using a rational choice framework
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Government agencies in the United States eradicated 10.3 million cannabis plants in 2010. Most (94%) of these plants were outdoor-grown, and 46% of those were discovered on federal lands, primarily on national forests in California, Oregon, and Washington. We developed models that reveal how drug markets, policies, and environmental conditions affect grow siting decisions. The models were built on a rational choice theoretical structure, and utilized data describing 2322 cannabis grow locations (2004-2012) and 9324 absence locations in the states' national forests. Predictor variables included cannabis market prices, law enforcement density, and socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental variables. We also used the models to construct regional maps of grow site likelihood. Significant predictors included marijuana street price and variables associated with grow site productivity (e.g., elevation and proximity to water), production costs, and risk of discovery. Overall, the pattern of grow site establishment on national forests is consistent with rational choice theory. In particular, growers consider cannabis prices and law enforcement when selecting sites. Ongoing adjustments in state cannabis laws could affect cultivation decisions on national forests. Any changes in cannabis policies can be reflected in our models to allow agencies to redirect interdiction resources and potentially increase discovery success. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Concentrated and Close to Home: The Spatial Clustering and Distance Decay of Lone Terrorist Vehicular Attacks
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives This study examines the spatial characteristics of vehicular terror attacks in Israel from a "micro place" perspective at the street segment level. Utilizing data obtained from the Israel Security Agency, Israel National police, and open sources, the study analyzes the 71 vehicular attacks carried out in Israel between 2000 and 2017. In addition to examining the hot-spots at which attacks occurred, we also identify "hot routes", estimated journey to attack routes. Methods We move beyond traditional approaches by calculating and comparing generalized Gini coefficients and their Lorenz curves for both the hot spots and hot routes. Results Tight spatial clustering in Jerusalem and the West Bank is found to be characteristic of this type of attack, which is limited by a range geographic constraints. Hot routes are identified as being highly concentrated at the street-segment level, although they are relatively less concentrated than hot-spots. Additionally, the presence of a strong distance decay function is confirmed. Conclusions The findings indicate that the laws of crime concentration are applicable to the case of lone terrorist vehicular attacks. The results demonstrate the utility of the methodological approach to examining specific types of terror attacks. Such approaches may be useful for informing environmental based prevention policies and strategies.

TI  - Predicting Recidivism Among Released Juvenile Offenders in Florida: An Evaluation of the Residential Positive Achievement Change Tool
T2  - YOUTH VIOLENCE AND JUVENILE JUSTICE
AB  - Each year in the United States, as many as 100,000 juvenile offenders are released after completing a residential placement. A significant task for researchers is to identify the factors that explain variations in recidivism. This study considers this by evaluating the predictive validity of the Residential Positive Achievement Change Tool (R-PACT), a fourth-generation risk assessment instrument adopted by Florida for use in all of its juvenile residential facilities. The R-PACT includes a wide variety of static and dynamic risk and needs scales that are used here to predict reoffending among 4,700 released juvenile offenders in Florida. We devote special attention to (1) whether R-PACT scales typically predict reoffending and (2) whether the R-PACT's predictive validity varies across different subgroups of offenders. In considering these questions, we also consider whether the predictive risk and protective factors in prior research are predictive in the R-PACT as well. The analysis revealed relatively strong support for the R-PACT, but there were nuanced exceptions to that pattern. We discuss the implications these findings have for assessing risk, monitoring progress among residential youth, and predicting reoffending.

TI  - Consumer Choice and Use of Multiple Information Sources for Automobile Purchases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
AB  - People consult various sources, including the Internet, to search for information before purchasing an automobile. We develop an econometric model for a consumer's time allocation over multiple information sources. The process of searching is viewed as a formal choice problem in which the consumer attempts to choose the amount of search from multiple sources to maximize the benefit of purchase net of search cost. Observed data on time allocation over representative sources are postulated to arise from this optimizing behavior, and the proposed econometric model is calibrated to four waves of survey data from buyers of new automobiles, covering purchases made in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005. Consistent with the requirement that buyers must complete the transaction and obtain delivery at dealerships, we find that, on average, the baseline preference for sources is the highest for dealer-related activities. However, we also find that the share of time devoted to the Internet increases considerably with overall search time. In particular, we find that more educated buyers under age 40 who search extensively are likely to rely heavily on the Internet in their search. This indicates that the Internet has become the key medium for manufacturers and dealers who are targeting younger, more educated buyers.

TI  - Understanding Men's Perceptions of Risks and Rewards in a Date Rape Scenario
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed.

TI  - A step in time: A sequence analysis and choice modelling approach to examine time allocation in individual activities and the role of neighbourhood crime
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
AB  - The Space-Time Budget (STB) method is used to collect spatial and temporal features of an individual's activities and is an important technique to explore relationships between the environment and crime. This spatial and temporal approach to the study of everyday activity spaces reveals much about victimisation experiences, the relationship between place, time, and perceptions of safety, and where and when offending may occur. Few studies, however, consider the relationship between living in a criminogenic place (neighbourhood crime) and people's daily activity patterns. Drawing on disaggregate app-based data for 50 participants tracked over a 7-day period, we use sequence analysis to first delineate time allocation to each activity on a minute-by-minute basis. Next, using result from the sequence analysis we introduce the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to understand how neighbourhood crime and socio-demographic characteristics influence individuals' time allocation to discrete daily activities. Results reveal that neighbourhood drug and violent incidents exert restrictions on an individual's propensity to spend time outside the home. Females and older people appear more likely to be constrained by the presence of neighbourhood crime (in particular drug and property incidents) as they allocate less time to outdoor activities. The principal utility of the current study is its methodological advancement and the practical insights for urban planning regarding the design of crime prevention strategies to increase guardianship in public places.

TI  - Moving beyond the rational choice debate via social capital: The study of illegal private protection
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB  - In the context of the epistemological and methodological debates about rational choice (RC) sparked by Green and Shapiro and the subsequent rejoinders, Hindmoor made the theoretical claim that there is now an opportunity for RC to be enhanced and for past debates to be set aside by incorporating different theoretical perspectives into RC. This article presents an example of one context in which this can be done: the study of illegal private protection (IPP) produced by organised criminals and corrupt officials. It extends a rational theory of criminal protection to enable the simultaneous analysis of corrupt protection and augments this approach with theories of social capital (SC). Both positive and negative forms and effects of SC are considered. This approach highlights a middle ground between advocates and critics of RC, demonstrating a capacity to explain patterns in the production of IPP between organisations and across countries.

TI  - Myopic decision making: An examination of crime decisions and their outcomes in sexual crimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: According to the rational choice approach, offenders consider costs and benefits when making decisions. This study applies this framework to sexual offenses and examines how various decisions made by perpetrators of sexual crimes influenced the desired and undesired crime outcomes that resulted.
   Methods: The study examines 2296 crimes of a sexual nature committed by a sample of 898 offenders evaluated at the Massachusetts Treatment Center. Using Generalized Estimating Equations, 23 predictor variables measuring sexually coercive decisions made in each crime about four aspects (who?, when?, where?, and how?) are used to predict ten desired (positive) and seven undesired (negative) crime outcomes for offenders.
   Results: Results indicated that decisions made by offenders in the context of their sexual crimes were mostly oriented towards the production of immediate positive outcomes and the prevention of immediate negative outcomes, but demonstrated little consideration for non-immediate negative outcomes.
   Conclusions: Sexual offenders engage in myopic or hyperbolic discounting when making criminal decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Crime displacement: what we know, what we don't know, and what it means for crime reduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - If offending were simply displaced following (often spatially) focused crime reduction initiatives, the continued expenditure of resources on this approach to crime reduction would be pointless. The aims of this article were to: critically appraise the current body of displacement research; identify gaps in understanding; articulate an agenda for future research; and to consider the implications of the accumulated findings for practitioners, evaluators, and policy makers.
   First, we review existing criminological theory regarding crime displacement and the alternative perspective-that crime prevention activity might generate a diffusion of crime control benefits. Second, we review the empirical research, focusing in particular on the findings of existing systematic reviews. Third, we consider the types of displacement that might occur and the methodological approaches employed to study them.
   Theoretical and empirical research suggests that displacement is far from inevitable and that a diffusion of crime control benefit is at least as likely. However, some forms of displacement have not been adequately studied.
   Existing research suggests that successful crime reduction interventions often have a positive impact on crime that extends beyond the direct recipients of a particular project. However, current understanding of crime displacement and how benefits might diffuse remains incomplete. Consequently, to inform an agenda for future research, we derive a typology of methodological issues associated with studying displacement, along with suggestions as to how they might be addressed.

TI  - A Socioeconomic Edge Effect: Rational Crime in Small Areas of Sharp Socioeconomic Contrast
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: To determine whether criminogenic "edges," as defined by crime pattern theory, exist at points of sharp contrast of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study uses a quasi-experimental design with pattern matching logic. A series of negative binomial regression models separately examine five different crimes with an economic incentive as dependent variables, and five crimes without an economic incentive as nonequivalent dependent variables, to determine whether census block groups of predominantly and comparatively higher SES than the wider surrounding area experience greater reported rational crime than would otherwise be expected. Results: The census block groups of comparatively higher SES located within and/or near areas of predominantly lower SES experienced one of the five crimes with an economic incentive, robberies by firearm, 40 percent more frequently than would otherwise be expected. Conclusions: The study's findings are partially consistent with its hypothesis, which is grounded in crime pattern, rational choice, routine activities, and social disorganization theories. The findings encourage future research that may extend the definition of an "edge" under crime pattern theory as well as research at the intersection of criminological theories.

TI  - Revisiting the generality of rational choice theory: Evidence for general patterns but differential effects across varying levels of psychopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Examining the role of individual differences in perceptions of risk and rewards to offending has become an important line of inquire (Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, & Madensen, 2006); however, psychopathy has yet to be considered. We tested the interaction between psychopathy and rational choice variables to determine if those with elevated psychopathy were differentially motivated to offend. Using a panel of 1307 serious juvenile offenders, we found a within-individual interaction effect between changes in psychopathy and changes in perceptions of risk and rewards after controlling for several relevant factors (e.g., early onset conduct problems, race, gender, exposure to violence, delinquent peer association, family criminal history, having children, gang involvement, and street time) and unobserved, between-individual heterogeneity. We further explored significant interactions using group-based models. These findings suggested that those with elevated psychopathy were more motivated by perceived rewards. However, the interaction for psychopathy and risk suggested that those with elevated levels of psychopathy were also more deterred by the perceived risks of offending. Findings support rational choice variables as robust predictors of offending; however, they may be most influential on decisions to offend among those demonstrating the greatest risk of offending.

T2  - AMCIS 2012 PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 18th Americas Conference on Information Systems
AB  - This study examines the rational choice and institutional factors influencing the spread of information technology enabled public safety network collaborations in the United States. Consistent with past neighbor effect research, this study tests economic, geographic, and demographic factors predictive of PSN proliferation at the state level. Results suggest a "follow the money" pattern, with internal and external resources, along with neighbor-state spending, being predictive of PSN proliferation. The "neighbor effect" here reflects a state level mimetic isomorphic influence that provides context to the more rational and resource-based factors associated with network proliferation. Examining isomorphic forces in public safety is particularly warranted since resource allocation decisions in this domain carry grave consequences. This study extends neighbor-effect research into the domain of public safety, identifies unexpected findings regarding violent crime rates and federal funding, and explores possibly ill-fit decision criteria by specifying a measure for mimetic isomorphism in public safety spending.

TI  - Learning the rational choice perspective: A reinforcement learning approach to simulating offender behaviours in criminological agent-based models
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Over the past 15 years, environmental criminologists have explored the application of agent-based models (ABMs) of crime events and various theoretical frameworks applied to understand them. Models have supported criminological theorising and, in some cases, been applied to make predictions about the impact of interventions devised to reduce crime. However, decision-making frameworks utilised in criminological ABMs have typically been implemented through traditional techniques such as condition-action rules. While these models have provided significant insights, they neglect a crucial component of theoretical accounts of offending, the notion that offenders are learning agents whose behavioural dynamics change over time and space. In response, this article presents an ABM of residential burglary in which offender agents utilise reinforcement learning (RL) to learn behaviours. This solution enables offender agents to learn from individual-level perceptions of the environment and, given these perceptions, develop behavioural responses that benefit themselves. The model includes conceptualisations of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Crime Pattern Theory (CPT) and a utility function, Target Attractiveness, which acts as a behavioural mould to nudge offender agents to learn behaviours in keeping with the Rational Choice Perspective (RCP). Trained behaviours are then tested by introducing crime prevention interventions into the model and examining the reactions of offender agents. In keeping with empirical studies of offending, experimental results demonstrate that offender agents utilising RL learn to offend at targets where rewards outweigh risks and effort, offend close to home, frequently victimise high-rewarding targets, and conversely learn to avoid offending in areas associated with high levels of risk and effort.

TI  - Minority threat, crime control, and police resource allocation in the Southwestern United States
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - Numerous studies have examined political influences on communities' allocations of fiscal and personnel resources to policing. Rational choice theory maintains that these resources are distributed in accordance with the need for crime control, whereas conflict theory argues that they are allocated with the aim of controlling racial and ethnic minorities. Existing research more consistently supports the conflict argument, but important issues remain unaddressed. The authors tested that approach by examining allocations of police resources in large cities in the Southwest, the yet-to-be-studied region in which the majority of Hispanics reside. The analyses included the key variables from the rational choice and conflict perspectives, as well as proximity to the border between the United States and Mexico. Minimal effects existed for percent Hispanic, an important conflict theory variable. However, Anglo-Hispanic income inequality and proximity to the border had effects consistent with that perspective. Class divisions within the Hispanic community may explain this pattern of findings.

TI  - Are Parrots CRAVED? An Analysis of Parrot Poaching in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Poaching significantly contributes to the endangerment of protected wildlife but has rarely been studied by criminologists. This study examines whether CRAVED, a general model of theft choices drawn from routine activity and rational choice theory, can help to explain parrot poaching. It correlates estimates of the numbers poached for the 22 species of Mexican parrots with measures of CRAVED components (concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable). Widely available species and those whose chicks are easily removable from the nest are more commonly poached, a pattern suggesting that most poachers are opportunistic villagers. More valuable/disposable and more enjoyable species are rarely taken because few remain in the wild after being heavily poached for export in the 1980s. Apart from helping to explain parrot poaching and consider conservation options, the application of CRAVED suggested a possible contribution to understanding theft choices. This was that "abundant" and "accessible" might replace "available.".

TI  - "Drop the Body": Body Disposal Patterns in Sexual Homicide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - The current study investigates body disposal patterns in sexual homicide and examines whether offender's behavior differ between solved and unsolved cases. To address these two research questions in line with rational choice perspective, a series of logistic regression analyses was conducted on a sample of 250 solved, and 100 unsolved sexual homicide cases in Canada. Within solved cases, results show that if victim is a prostitute, body found concealed, and found lying face down, it is likely the body was moved. For unsolved cases, the role of victim as a prostitute, and body recovered outdoors suggest that the body was moved. Further, results indicate that post-crime phase factors predicted the most whether the victim's body was moved in solved cases. Whereas within unsolved cases, crime-phase factors contributed the most at predicting whether the body was moved post-homicide. Theoretical and practical implications from this study are discussed.

TI  - TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL POLICY IN THE ERA OF MASS ROBOTIZATION OF VEHICLES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF LAW
AB  - The problem of road safety and vehicle operation raises a number of complexities of a socioeconomic, administrative, and criminal nature. Therefore, the provisions considered in this article are mainly aimed at defining the problematic issues facing modern society in the era of active development of scientific and technological progress and ensuring transport security.
   The upcoming changes related to the mass introduction of driverless vehicles should already find options for the criminal law reaction of the legislator. However, until now, the scientific achievements under consideration are in the plane of the traditional understanding of the mechanism of criminal behavior. The threat of stage-by-stage robotization consists in the inevitable transformation of the existing foundations of public consciousness and the current legal system, which in the new conditions will become ineffective or even contradictory. It is completely justified to believe that to prevent such a development of events, a comprehensive analysis and legal assessment of the risks from the use of robotic cars is necessary, followed by the development of a unified concept of criminal policy, as well as proposals for improving the current legislation.
   The author refers to the main vectors of development of the criminal policy of the state:
   - expanding theoretical knowledge about the risks of using robotic vehicles;
   - obtaining new scientific data on the current state of road crime, socio-demographic and psychophysiological personality traits of the driver responsible for an accident.
   - obtaining new scientific data on the legal nature, mechanism of Commission and structure of road crime in the era of robotization, regularities of situational approach to the study of this problem.
   - theoretical justification of the modernization of domestic criminal legislation in the field of road safety, as well as modern approaches to preventive measures to prevent road crime.
   - development of new coping strategies as a means of self-control of the driver in stressful situations based on the discovery of new knowledge about the evolution of metacognitive patterns of the road criminal's personality and environmental influence on them.
   - development of a new methodology for professional driver training, along with the use of Informatization and technical control tools.
   - discovery of new ways to use the results of the research when developers create algorithms for the ethical choice model of robotic vehicles in provocative conditions.

TI  - Emergent Regularities of Interpersonal Victimization: An Agent-Based Investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization.
   Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness).
   Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime.
   Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.

AB  - Terror operations are carried out by a team of terrorists with their interaction and cooperation. Different tie strengths, such as acquaintances, friends, and family members, influence the construction and reconstruction of the operation team. Understanding the interaction patterns of tie strength might be useful not only for advancing our understanding of terror operations, but ultimately for providing more effective methods of countering terrorist violence. To this end, in this paper, we designed an operation-related social network, and analyzed the tie strength selection and cooperative reconnection in the terror operation networks. We proposed three hypotheses about the tie strengths and had the Al-Qaeda dataset investigated to test the hypotheses. Results demonstrate that the terrorist organization has some different interaction patterns against the ordinary social organizations and the terror operations share similar features with crime events in rational choice. Our analysis reveals that tie strength matters in terror operations and is essentially helpful in making counterterrorism strategies.

TI  - Mobilizing extremism: an examination of the travel patterns of right-wing extremists in the United States
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION
AB  - Extensive criminological research has documented a 'distance-decay' effect in criminal activity, with offenders less likely to commit crimes farther from their residences. While recent studies have identified similar patterns in ideologically motivated violence, variation in the travel behaviors of extremists remains underexplored. Using data on right-wing extremists who carried out a violent plot, between 2000 and 2020, alongside information on Capitol insurrectionist arrestees - and drawing on routine activity and rational-choice theories of offender decision-making - this study extends this literature along three dimensions: type, time, and ties. First, we distinguish between different types of offenders, showing that while both violent extremists and insurrectionists exhibit distance-decays, the latter tend to travel farther and exhibit a more irregular decay. Secondly, we identify a meaningful temporal shift in the right-wing extremist landscape, with offenders increasingly traveling longer distances to execute their plots. Finally, we highlight the role of social ties in shaping travel behaviors, where individuals affiliated with extremist groups tend to travel longer distances. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the spatial behavior of right-wing extremists, the factors influencing their mobility, and the evolving nature of right-wing extremism in the United States.

TI  - Differential Development of Perceived Costs and Rewards of Offending the Relevance for Predicting Offending in Early Adulthood: A Group-Based Trajectory Modeling Approach
T2  - VICTIMS & OFFENDERS
AB  - The present study sought to elucidate developmental patterns of perceived costs and rewards of offending and examine the relevance of this development for predicting offending in adulthood. The Pathways to Desistance data were used in analyses. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify latent patterns of development for both constructs. Negative binomial regression was used to test the relevance of differential development for predicting offending. A series of generalized estimation equations modeled age-graded changes in offending seriousness across the entire study period for each trajectory group identified in both models. Results indicated that a four-group model best fit the rewards data, while a three-group model best fit the costs data. Perceived rewards trajectory group membership significantly predicted offending in adulthood, with consistently elevated perception of rewards of offending found to be related to increased offending seriousness in adulthood. Differential development of perceived costs did not influence offending in adulthood. Consistently low and declining perceived rewards were associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to participants getting older. Increasing perceived costs of crime were similarly associated with declines in offending seriousness across the study period due to age.

TI  - Geographic Patterns and Profiling of Illegal Crossings of the Southern US Border
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - Border control is a crucial component of national security. For a country the size of the United States, however, the length of its land borders and coastlines poses a significant security challenge. Illegal migrant workers, drug couriers, foreign terrorists, smugglers, fugitives, and other criminals benefit from the geographic range and porous nature of American borders. The purpose of this research was to identify facilitating and inhibiting factors of illegal land border crossings in order to determine physical and human geographic features related to the probability of such movement. Identifying the geographic patterns of illegal migration can help the Border Patrol optimize resource allocation and anticipate offender reactions.

TI  - Development of juvenile delinquency - causes and conditions
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY-LAW-VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO
AB  - In the last few decades, juvenile delinquency in the Republic of Bulgaria has begun to acquire new and specific characteristics. Inexplicable cases of violence are all too common in schools, families and public places. The article analyzes a small part of the theories of juvenile delinquency that exist in the global aspect, which are based on the understanding that criminal acts are determined by mental and behavioral processes at the individual level. According to the theory of rational choice, minors are motivated offenders who subordinate their behavior to a certain goal. Another group of views is defined as theories of biological and psychological traits. Antisocial manifestations are not so much due to the course of certain motivational processes in an individual's mental state, but primarily to the formation of individual patterns of behavior. The article aims to assist Bulgarian criminal law and criminology in clarifying the current circumstances in which juvenile delinquency develops, and the conclusion is that they do not differ significantly from those in the global context. The different perspectives on juvenile delinquency and the interdisciplinary nature of the problems are presented as objectively as possible. Such an approach can lead to a rethinking of the mechanisms and measures that should be applied to achieve the educational purpose of punishment. The analysis presented in the article also supports the introduction of alternative measures to punishment, as well as the achievement of better results in terms of resocialization of juvenile offenders.

TI  - Criminals and the Price System: Evidence from Czech Metal Thieves
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper tests the economic theory of criminal behavior. Specifically, it looks at "the carrot" side of the theory, studying how thieves react to changes in monetary gains from crime.
   Using a unique crime-level dataset on metal theft in the Czech Republic, we study thieves' behavior in a simple regression framework. We argue that variation in metal prices represents a quasi-experimental variation in gains from crime. It is because (1) people steal copper and other nonferrous metals only to sell them to scrapyard and (2) prices at scrapyards are set by the world market. This facilitates causal interpretation of our regression estimates.
   We find that a 1% increase (decrease) in the re-sale price causes metal thefts to increase (decrease) by 1-1.5%. We show that the relationship between prices and thefts is very robust. Moreover, we find that thieves' responses to price shocks are rapid and consistent.
   Our results are in line with the economic model of crime, wherein criminal behavior is modeled as a rational agent's decision driven by the costs and benefits of undertaking criminal activities. Our estimates are also consistent with recent results from the United Kingdom, suggesting these patterns are more general.

TI  - Spatial analysis with preference specification of latent decision makers for criminal event prediction
T2  - DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB  - Spatial analysis looks for statistically significant patterns in observed events that occur at specified locations. Most examples of spatial analysis consider aggregate characteristics over a number of coarsely defined regions rather than point processes. However, criminal events are point processes and should be modeled as such. In this paper, we combine recent advances in discrete choice theory and data mining to develop point process models for spatial analysis. We use this new methodology to analyze and predict the spatial behavior of criminals, and more generally, latent decision makers. The paper compares the performance of this methodology to more traditional hot spot methods of crime analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI  - Rural Crime and Social Capital
T2  - GROWTH AND CHANGE
AB  - This study explores rural U.S. crime patterns with a focus on social capital. We use a triangulation of three core theories of crime including social disorganization, anomie/strain, and rational choice theories to develop a formal theory and an empirical framework. The role of four unique measures of social capital is explored in understanding patterns of rural crime using nonmetropolitan U.S. county data. The empirical results generally support the theoretical predictions and conclude that rural communities that pursue economic growth and development must be prepared to address the resulting upward pressures on crime. The results on social capital and crime provide numerous policy insights for rural communities.

TI  - Arena-based events and crime: an analysis of hourly robbery data
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - This article makes use of hourly crime counts to model the relationship between events that take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and robberies, an arena that has caused local controversy regarding the costs and benefits of hosting such an entertainment venue. Results from the econometric model suggest that the NHL's New Jersey Devils ice hockey games, concerts, and Disney-themed events are all associated with increases in robbery, while various other event categories such as the NBA basketball games played by the Nets and boxing, and mixed martial arts (MMA) matches are not associated with an increase. These findings support two complementary ecological theories of crime that focus on how events provide additional opportunities for crime by increasing the associated benefits while simultaneously decreasing the cost for economically motivated offenders to take advantage of.

TI  - Crime in the breaking: Gender differences in desistance
T2  - LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW
CP  - 92nd Annual Meeting of the American-Sociological-Association
AB  - Despite increasing interest in understanding patterns of criminal behavior over the life course and, especially, desistance from crime, evidence about the predictors of these experiences has been derived only from samples of male offenders. We evaluate whether there are gender differences in the predictors of both self-reported illegal earnings and arrest among samples of recently released male and female offenders. Our analysis of gender differences illustrates how both the behavior of the offender and the behavior of law shape our understanding of the transition out of crime. We analyze event history data from a large-scale social experiment that provided employment to male and female offenders. The results indicate that (1) gender differences in the predictors of desistance largely depend on the domain of behavior under consideration; (2) indicators of normative status, as opposed to the perceived risks of crime or age-graded informal controls, are particularly important determinants of women's risks of rearrest.

TI  - Crime rates and inequality: a study of crime in contemporary China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB  - This paper examines the impact of intra-provincial regional inequality on crime rates in China. The results suggest that the western theories of crime can be applied equally to China. The crime rate is found to be positively correlated with intra-provincial regional inequality, but negatively correlated with the level of education. In addition, it is also observed that the crime rate is positively linked with the level of inflation, unemployment rate, as well as inequality in consumption and employment between the rural and urban sectors. The results lend strong support to Merton's theory and Marxian theory. However, the rational choice theory is not supported.

TI  - GENERATIVE EXPLANATIONS OF CRIME: USING SIMULATION TO TEST CRIMINOLOGICAL THEORY
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study demonstrates that computational modeling and, in particular, agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a viable compatriot to traditional experimental methodologies for criminology scholars. ABM can be used as a means to operationalize and test hypothetical mechanisms that offer a potential explanation for commonly observed criminological phenomena. This study tests whether the hypothesized mechanisms of environmental criminology are sufficient to produce several commonly observed characteristics of crime. We present an ABM of residential burglary, simulating a world inhabited by potential targets and offenders who behave according to the theoretical propositions of environmental criminology. A series of simulated experiments examining the impact of these mechanisms on patterns of offending are performed. The outputs of these simulations then are compared with several well-established findings derived from empirical studies of residential burglary, including the spatial concentration of crime, repeat victimization, and the journey to crime curve. The results from this research demonstrate that the propositions of the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and crime pattern theory provide a viable generative explanation for several independent characteristics of crime.

TI  - The Criminal Histories of Drug-Drive Offenders
T2  - POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This study examined the previous criminal behaviour of individuals who were arrested for violating the drug driving over the prescribed limit offence, introduced into the UK in March 2015. The sample consists of individuals arrested during the first year of enforcement of this offence from March 2015 to March 2016 within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Metropolitan Police Service in London. The previous criminal behaviour of the research subjects was framed within a number of criminological theories and there is examination of any correlation between their criminal history and the drug-driving offence they had been arrested for. The criminal activity was obtained from each individual's criminal record held on the police national computer and coded with regards to offence groups. As well as criminal sanctions, there was also an examination of drug-related arrest histories. The results indicate a high level of previous criminal activity with drugs and driving matters dominating that activity. This supports the construct that, in this context, drug driving fits within their patterns of offending.

TI  - Exploratory Space-Time Analysis of Burglary Patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper introduces two new methods for the exploratory analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of residential burglary patterns. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chain which considers the extent to which a location's probability of experiencing a residential burglary in a future period is related to the prevalence of residential burglaries in its surrounding neighborhood in an initial period. The second measure extends this conditional perspective to examine the joint evolution of residential burglary in a location and its surrounding neighborhood. These methods are applied to a case study of residential burglary patterns in Mesa, Arizona over the period October 2005 through December 2009. Strong patterns of spatial clustering of burglary activity are present in each year, and this clustering is found to have an important influence on both the conditional and joint evolution of burglary activity across space and time.

TI  - Coal Strip Mining, Mountaintop Removal, and the Distribution of Environmental Violations across the United States, 2002-2008
T2  - LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
AB  - This study draws upon concepts in landscape research and environmental justice to examine the association between community poverty and environmental violations that occurred between 2002 and 2008 across 110 coal strip mining operations located within the United States. Multivariate results suggest that residential poverty is greater around facilities that have been identified as violating an environmental law. In addition, the association between poverty and violations is dependent upon regulatory inspections. While an increase in inspections is associated with an increase in the odds that a violation will be discovered, it is also associated with lower levels of community poverty. We conclude that this pattern of associations between poverty, inspections, and violations is consistent with arguments in the environmental justice and landscape literatures.

TI  - Illuminating a Dark Side of the American Dream: Assessing the Prevalence and Predictors of Mortgage Fraud across US Counties
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Using novel county-level data, the authors document that nearly 25% of residential mortgage loans originated between 2003 and 2005 in America contained one or more indications of mortgage fraud but also that rates were highly variable across counties. Multivariate regression models reveal that rates of mortgage fraud were higher in areas with greater loan volumes, a larger share of loans originated by independent mortgage companies, elevated rates of preexisting property crime, and higher levels of black-white racial segregation; it was less prevalent where government-sponsored enterprises purchased a larger share of the loans sold in secondary mortgage markets. The findings are most consistent with classic and contemporary anomie theories and perspectives that highlight the geographic targeting of selected housing markets with loan products and tactics that provided fertile ground for mortgage fraud. The authors discuss the implications of these patterns for developing a more comprehensive understanding of contemporary spatial inequalities.

TI  - Does the Organized Sexual Murderer Better Delay and Avoid Detection?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - According to the organized-disorganized model, organized sexual murderers adopt specific behaviors during the commission of their crimes that contribute to avoiding police detection. The current study examines the effect of sexual murderers' organized behaviors on their ability to both delay and/or avoid police detection. Using a combination of negative binomial and logistic regression analyses on a sample of 350 sexual murder cases, findings showed that although both measures of delaying and avoiding detection are positively correlated, different behavioral patterns were observed. For instance, offenders who moved the victim's body were more likely to avoid detection but the victim's body was likely to be recovered faster. Moreover, victim characteristics have an impact on both measures; however, this effect disappears for the measure of delaying detection once the organized behaviors are introduced. Implications of the findings are discussed.

TI  - Getting a handle on crime: A further extension of routine activities theory
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - Routine activities theory has had considerable influence, stimulating subsequent theoretical development, generating an empirical literature on crime patterns and informing the design of prevention strategies. Despite these numerous applications of the theory to date, a promising vein for theoretical development, research and prevention remains untapped. The concept of handlers, or those who control potential offenders, has received relatively little attention since introduced by Felson (1986). This article examines the reasons for the lack of attention to handlers and extends routine activities theory by proposing a model of handler effectiveness that addresses these issues. in addition, the model explicitly links routine activities theory with two of its complements the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention to articulate the mechanism by which handling prevents crime. We conclude by discussing the broad range of prevention possibilities offered by the model of handler effectiveness.

TI  - Crime of Opportunity? A Theoretical Exploration of the Incidence of Armed Banditry in Nigeria
T2  - INSIGHT ON AFRICA
AB  - The incidence of armed banditry has exacerbated the security conundrum in Nigeria to create a multidimensional security quandary. Meanwhile, the extant studies on the matter offer insubstantial theoretical explanations. This study attempts an extensive approach that captures the necessitating factors for banditry from an opportunistic standpoint. This is heralded on the presupposition that crime occurs as a result of the opportunities presented to carry it out. Therefore, this study adopts the theories of crime opportunities, such as routine activity theory, rational choice and crime pattern to expound on the incidence of armed banditry in Nigeria. It was found out that opportunities play a role in banditry; the phenomenon is concentrated in time and space; the opportunities for the menace is highly specific and that the incidence produces opportunities for other crimes. Solutions rooted in the theoretical proposition of situational crime prevention and crime prevention through environmental design theories are thence proffered.

TI  - Carjacking: Scope, Structure, Process, and Prevention
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Carjacking is a violent crime with a broad motivational landscape related to the unique opportunities that a motor vehicle, as the item targeted, makes available to offenders once it is stolen. Although carjacking is technically a form of robbery, carjacking is a hybrid offense because it draws from elements of both regular robbery and motor vehicle theft. Nuanced in its etiology and expression, carjacking boasts a structure and process that require offenders to navigate multiple challenges under considerable time pressure and uncertainty. The fact that carjacking is so often opportunistic yet simultaneously requires a fair amount of calculation makes the offense even more subtle in its complexity. The purpose of this review is to examine these nuances through the lens of official data and existing empirical research. Nascent but growing, this research provides insight into the scope of the problem, the method and manner of the crime's commission, and the challenges of curbing a clear urban menace.

TI  - Power-seeking crime? The professional thief versus the professional launderer
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Relating the concept of power to motives and objectives for criminal activities results in different images of criminals and their motivations. In this article, we aim to reflect on two different forms of crime (burglary versus money laundering) starting from a power perspective. We describe how the pursuit of power may or may not be related to crime, perpetrators and the policies that have been developed to prevent or repress these types of crime. By examining the motives behind both burglary and money laundering, we try to make clear how the concept of power and power pursuit leads to different rationales in criminal conduct. We try to determine to what extent 'rational choice' plays a role in this respect. As a conclusion, we argue that 'power' as such influences patterns of crime, victimisation and societal reactions (by means of criminal policy). The extent to which power accumulation is an outcome of crime, will in part determine the social reaction to crime and as a result, the perceived threat of crime.

TI  - REINTEGRATIVE POLICE SURVEILLANCE OF JUVENILE-OFFENDERS - FORGING AN URBAN MODEL
T2  - CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB  - This article reviews patterns of police behavior vis-a-vis juvenile offenders and proposes a model called reintegrative surveillance, which is an integration of community-based corrections and community policing. Neither community-based corrections nor community policing is designed to handle serious, repeat offenders who are returning to high-crime neighborhoods. Police need to reexamine their roles to ensure that (a) policies of maintaining order and consequences of disorder are not ambiguous or misleading to youths and (b) order maintenance and law enforcement practices do not interfere with police ability to protect youths as victims of crime. Both tendencies are clearly widespread problems, and neither will be addressed as long as the ''worst'' neighborhoods and youths are considered beyond salvation. Correctional programs need to reevaluate police as a pivotal community resource. Reintegrative surveillance must include a gradational, consistent criminal justice response, protection, vigilance, interagency goal setting, and agency coordination.

TI  - Informal Social Control and Crime Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Informal social control at micro-level places such as addresses, collections of addresses, and streetblocks is a critical factor in understanding crime patterns. Historically, informal social control has been associated with community-level theories such as social disorganization, systemic theory, and collective efficacy. This article reviews several important streams of literature that address the role of informal social control in controlling crime at micro-level places. It begins with opportunity theories such as rational choice, routine activity, and crime pattern theories, which mention informal social control as playing a role in crime control. More detailed treatment of the role of informal social control is offered by theoretical work addressing eyes on the street and human territorial functioning. Together, these various theoretical perspectives provide the basis for the specification of mechanisms that reflect how informal social control can prevent crime events. The article explains each theory, discusses the spatial scale at which the dynamics operate, highlights gaps in the current body of knowledge, and proposes a two-pronged research path forward.

TI  - CHANGES IN THE SEX PATTERNING OF PERCEIVED THREATS OF SANCTIONS
T2  - LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW
AB  - In contrast to a recent survey conducted by Miller and Simpson, two earlier surveys of adults, one conducted in 1972 and the other in 1982, reported that women scored higher than men on measures of what Grasmick and Bursik recently have called perceived threats of shame and embarrassment, as well as legal sanctions, for violating the law. Hagan's power-control theory, coupled with trends in labor force and household composition, is used to predict a decline over time in the magnitude of the effect of sex on perceived threats of sanctions. The 1982 survey is merged with an identical one conducted in 1992 to determine whether men and women have become more alike in their perception of these threats. Evidence supporting the predictions from power-control theory is found for theft but not for assault. The findings are discussed in the context of various theories and previous research concerning gender, crime, and social control.

TI  - Crime and conflict: Homicide in evolutionary psychological perspective
T2  - CRIME AND JUSTICE: A REVIEW OF JUSTICE
AB  - Criminological theories are usually framed in sociological terms but always entail psychological assumptions. Psychological accounts, in their turn, entail assumptions about the adaptive ''design'' of evolved mental mechanisms and processes. Thus, explicit attention to recent theory and research on psychology and evolution can sometimes help criminologists generate productive hypotheses and avoid blind alleys. Homicide research is illustrative. Interpersonal conflicts are engendered by interactions among individuals whose psyches were designed by natural and sexual selection to make them effective competitors and effective nepotists (kin-benefactors). These considerations suggest numerous testable hypotheses about such matters as who is likely to kill whom, and how the demography of homicide perpetration and victimization is likely to vary among victim-killer relationships. An evolutionary psychological perspective inspires us to criticize recent criminological discussions of sex differences and age patterns in criminal offending, theories that contrast rational choice with emotional or impulsive behavior, and the medicalization of antisocial behavior as a pathology.

TI  - EARNINGS PROSPECTS, MATCHING EFFECTS, AND THE DECISION TO TERMINATE A CRIMINAL CAREER
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This study represents an effort to investigate the age pattern of criminal involvement from an economist's perspective. It presents a dynamic stochastic model of sequential search and match evaluation which is used to explain the reasons for, and the timing of, the decision to terminate a criminal career. The behavioral implications derived from the theoretical model are tested using individual National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Estimation results strongly support the prediction of a negative relation between the option value of retaining a criminal career and desistance decisions. More specifically, the effects of current and future expected criminal earnings are shown to be negative, substantial, and statistically significant in determining desistance probabilities. Retiring behavior is also significantly responsive to variables measuring personal costs of punishment and the availability and attractiveness of a legal income-generating activity in ways consistent with theoretical expectations.

TI  - Domestic and intimate violence: An application of routine activities theory
T2  - AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR
AB  - Much individual-level resenl ch in criminology is based on deterministic models of street-crime and suite-crime. Factors that constrain individuals to crime or conformity are predominant. This paper explores the advantages of a more soft determinism in explaining crime; especially intimate violence. Routine activities theory, which assumes freedom of action and rational choice, is used here to analyze patterns of intimate violence, especially, child sexual abuse. Marcus Felson's model of predatory crime provides a unique interpretation of intimate violence. Criminal incidents involve the physical convergence of three elements: a motivated offender; a suitable target; and the absence of a capable guardian. The convergence of these factors in intimate violence is analyzed; the potential of routine activity theory in explaining domestic abuse is assessed. Finally suggestions for crime control in intimate violence based on routine activities theory are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Criminal Contemplation, National Context, and Deterrence
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Using random samples of adults from three European countries rarely surveyed about crime-related issues, this study seeks to identify, with more extensive indicators than is typical, individuals who are likely to contemplate the commission of criminal acts. Then, it assesses the contextual universality of deterrence claims by estimating the deterrent effectiveness of perceived formal and informal sanctions for theft and violence among crime contemplators in Greece, Russia, and Ukraine. With criminal contemplation taken into account, our findings confirm the patterns established in past research. Whereas the threat of formal punishment shows little deterrent effect, perceptions of informal sanctions appear to influence projected crime. However, supportive findings hold only in Russia and Ukraine. Overall, it appears that the deterrent effectiveness of sanctions may be to some extent contingent on cultural or contextual characteristics.

TI  - The dark side of organizations: Mistake, misconduct, and disaster
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY
AB  - In keeping with traditional sociological concerns about order and disorder, this essay addresses the dark side of organizations. To build a theoretical basis for the dark side as an integrated field of study, I review four literatures in order to make core ideas of each available to specialists in the others. Using a Simmelian-based case comparison method of analogical theorizing, I first consider sociological constructs that identify both the generic social form and the generic origin of routine nonconformity: how things go wrong in socially organized settings. Then I examine three types of routine nonconformity with adverse outcomes that harm the public: mistake, misconduct, and disaster produced in and by organizations. Searching for analogies and differences, I find that in common, routine nonconformity, mistake, misconduct, and disaster are systematically produced by the interconnection between environment, organizations, cognition, and choice. These patterns amplify what is known about social structure and have implications for theory, research, and policy.

TI  - A historical perspective on crime control and private security: a Belgian case study
T2  - POLICING & SOCIETY
AB  - Since the last decade of the twentieth century, several authors have claimed that the contemporary and 'new' developments in (private) policing and crime control form part of the process of neo-liberal policies and rational choice approaches to crime. However, as is argued in this paper, so-called late-modern strategies and discourses of risk-reduction, loss prevention and situational crime prevention were already present in the armoury of crime control measures more than a hundred years ago. To demonstrate the shortcomings in criminological theory with regards to longer-term patterns of crime control, I have used a case study approach to private (security) organisations in the Port of Antwerp between 1880 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Hence, this study analyses the policing discourses and practices of private players, in cooperation with the public police and authorities or not. It shows that even during the heyday of the criminal justice state, they aimed exclusively at manipulating the temporal and spatial dimensions of the opportunity structures in which criminal activities could develop, which is quite similar to contemporary approaches. Therefore, existing criminological accounts that stress the discontinuities in policing and security need to be questioned.

TI  - Measurement of Potential Victims of Burglary at the Mesoscale: Comparison of Census, Phone Users, and Social Media Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Since the target of burglars is generally the property of the inhabitant, it is crucial to accurately measure potential victims when analyzing burglaries, especially in small areas. Previous studies on burglary are mostly based on large units such as census tracts or communities. One of the difficulties is the measurement of the potential victims of burglary at the mesoscale. We compare the measuring effects of census population, census households, nighttime mobile phone users, and nighttime social media, such as the Tencent regional heatmap (TRH), on potential victims of burglary on 150 m x 150 m grids. Based on the rational choice theory, and controlling for the potentially confounding effects of risks and cost, we show that the TRH performed best, followed by census households and census population, and phone users performed poorly. The best-performing time period for TRH data was 3:00-5:00 am on weekends. These findings could lead to an improved measurement of potential victims of burglary at the mesoscale, and could provide scientific insight for crime prevention.

TI  - DETERRING CORPORATE CRIME
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Using event history analysis, we examine the recidivism patterns of a sample of 38 corporations charged with one or more serious antitrust violations between 1928 and 1981 to see whether sanction experience decreases the likelihood of a firm's reoffending. Specifically, we analyze the effects of procedure type (eg., civil, criminal and administrative redress) and proxy measures of corporate deterrence while controlling for changes in antitrust law and the economic conditions of the firm, industry, and general economy. Though not robust, there is some evidence that past guilty verdicts and changes in penalties for lawbreaking from misdemeanors to felonies inhibit recidivism. We note, however, that industry characteristics are stronger by far in their effects on future illegality than formal sanction risk or consequence. The implications of these findings for organizational deterrence and corporate crime control are discussed.

TI  - Violent Victimization Across the Life Course Moving a "Victim Careers" Agenda Forward
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - The present study examines violent victimization patterns across the life course and outlines a victim careers agenda for future scholarly inquiry. I analyzed four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine whether violent victimization prevalence, onset, and persistence during earlier stages of the life course can predict violent victimization risk in adulthood, and whether these relationships are observed independent of current violent offending. Violent victimization in adolescence was significantly related to subsequent risk in adulthood. Even when current violent offending is controlled, those who report early and persistent violent victimization during prior stages of the life course appear particularly vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The findings demonstrate the importance of moving forward with a victim careers agenda and the present study outlines numerous theoretical and empirical avenues for victimization scholars to pursue.

TI  - Hot or Cool Processing? Adolescent Decision-Making and Delinquency
T2  - JUSTICE QUARTERLY
AB  - Adolescence is a vulnerable period of individual development when decision-making is easily compromised, and criminal involvement reaches its peak. We draw on and extend novel decision-making perspectives and use the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 13,399) to analyze whether factors representing adverse physical conditions, negative mental states, and stressful social circumstances condition the effect of thoughtfully reflective decision-making (TRDM) on adolescent delinquent behavior. We find that experiencing various "hot triggers" such as sleep problems, depression, and straining conditions significantly reduces the crime-preventive impact of TRDM (an example of cool processing) among adolescents. We outline potential avenues for further theoretical development of integrated frameworks of decision-making and crime and discuss policy implications aimed at ways to deal with the adverse social, emotional, and physical triggers and foster thoughtful decision-making skills among adolescents.

TI  - Crime and work
T2  - CRIME AND JUSTICE: A REVIEW OF RESEARCH, VOL 25
AB  - Crime and legal work are not mutually exclusive choices but represent a continuum of legal and illegal income-generating activities. The links between crime and legal work involve trade-offs among crime returns, punishment costs, legal work opportunity costs, and tastes and preferences regarding both types of work. Rising crime rates in the 1980s in the face of rising incarceration rates suggest that the threat of punishment is not the dominant cost of crime. Crime rates are inversely related to expected legal wages, particularly among young males with limited job skills or prospects. Recent ethnographic research shows that involvement in illegal work often is motivated by low wages and harsh conditions in legal work. Many criminal offenders "double up" in both leg al work and crime, either concurrently or sequentially. This overlap suggests a fluid and dynamic interaction between legal and illegal work. Market wages and job opportunities interact with social and legal pressures to influence decisions to abandon crime for legal work. Explanations of the patterns of legal and illegal work should be informed by econometric, social structural, and labeling theories. The continuity of legal and illegal work, suggests the importance of illegal wages in research and theory on criminal decision making.

TI  - Self-exciting point process models of civilian deaths in Iraq
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - Our goal in this article is to characterize temporal patterns of violent civilian deaths in Iraq. These patterns are expected to evolve on time-scales ranging from years to minutes as a result of changes in the security environment on equally varied time-scales. To assess the importance of multiple time-scales in evolving security threats, we develop a self-exciting point process model similar to that used in earthquake analysis. Here the rate of violent events is partitioned into a background rate and a foreground self-exciting component. Background rates are assumed to change on relatively long time-scales. Foreground self-excitation, in which events trigger an increase in the rate of violence, is assumed to be short-lived. We explore the model using data from Iraq Body Count on civilian deaths between 2003 and 2007. Our results indicate that self-excitation makes up as much as 37-50 per cent of all violent events and that self-excitation lasts at most between two and six weeks, depending upon the district in question. Appropriate security responses may benefit from taking these different time-scales of violence into consideration.

TI  - The impact of community residents' occupational structure on the spatial distribution of different types of crimes
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Spatial characteristics of community resident's occupational structure is a classic topic in social geography studies. However, it is still an under-explored topic to examine the impact of community residents' occupational structure on the spatial pattern of different types of crimes. Taking a large city in South China as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of different types of occupational residents on the crimes of burglary, pickpocketing and assault by establishing spatial lag negative binomial regression models. Our study shows that different occupational groups have different social characteristics and socioeconomic status, and so do their different impacts on various criminal activities. The specific conclusions are as follows: 1) the person in charge of the unit has no significant influence on these three types of crimes; 2) professional skill workers have a significant positive impact on pickpocketing and assault; 3) clerks, business and service people and primary industry personnel have significant positive impacts on burglary; and 4) the distribution of personnel in the primary industry nearby will inhibit burglary, pickpocketing and assault. This study further explained the results in combination with the 'costs, benefits and risks' of rational choice theory. The conclusions may be of great reference value for community police strategies.

TI  - Examining the role of differential association and techniques of neutralization in explaining corporate crime
T2  - DEVIANT BEHAVIOR
AB  - A limited number of studies have examined white-collar offending decision making patterns and virtually none have focused on testing Differential Association or Techniques of Neutralization theory in particular. This study evaluates the offending decisions of MBA students to commit corporate offending in the promotion/sales of a hypothetical pharmaceutical drug. The sample consisted of 133 MBA students enrolled at a university in the United States. Findings supported predictions that anticipated agreement of coworkers and the board of directors would be positively associated with decisions to further market an produce a hypothetical drug that was about to be recalled by the Food and Drug Administration. However, results also showed that the decision to commit corporate crime was inversely related to perceptions that close friends and business professors agree with the decision, which went against predictions based on differential association theory. Several neutralizing techniques-especially the beliefs that government exaggerates dangers to the consumer and profit is the most important priority-predicted the decision to further market the drug. Subsequent analyses showed that older respondents were more likely to employ techniques of neutralization in decisions to commit corporate crime, especially techniques relating to profits. Future research directions are outlined.

TI  - The CIA made me do it: understanding the political economy of corruption in Kazakhstan
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution recently completed in the U. S. District Court in New York City. It features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of paying bribes totaling as high as $84 million dollars to high-ranking members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President, the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people. To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil leases from the Kazakhstan government.

TI  - What Deters Crime? Comparing the Effectiveness of Legal, Social, and Internal Sanctions Across Countries
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The question of what deters crime is of both theoretical and practical interest. The present paper focuses on what factors deter minor, non-violent crimes, i.e., dishonest actions that violate the law. Much research has been devoted to testing the effectiveness of legal sanctions on crime, while newer models also include social sanctions (judgment of friends or family) and internal sanctions (feelings of guilt). Existing research suggests that both internal sanctions and, to a lesser extent, legal sanctions deter crime, but it is unclear whether this pattern is unique to Western countries or robust across cultures. We administered a survey study to participants in China, Colombia, Germany, Portugal, and USA, five countries from distinct cultural regions of the world. Participants were asked to report the likelihood of engaging in seven dishonest and illegal actions, and were asked to indicate the probability and severity of consequences for legal, friend, family, and internal sanctions. Results indicated that across countries, internal sanctions had the strongest deterrent effects on crime. The deterrent effects of legal sanctions were weaker and varied across countries. Furthermore, the deterrent effects of legal sanctions were strongest when internal sanctions were lax. Unexpectedly, social sanctions were positively related to likelihood of engaging in crime. Taken together, these results suggest that the relative strengths of legal and internal sanctions are robust across cultures and dishonest actions.

TI  - Perceived deterrence and outcomes in drug court
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW
CP  - Annual Conference of the American-Psychology-and-Law-Society
AB  - According to perceived-deterrence theory, the likelihood that an offender will engage in drug use or illegal activity is influenced by the perceived certainty of being detected for infractions or recognized for accomplishments, the perceived certainty of receiving sanctions for infractions or rewards for accomplishments, and the anticipated magnitude of the sanctions and rewards. This study evaluated drug court participants' perceived deterrence at monthly intervals during their enrollment in drug court. Exploratory cluster analysis (N = 255) on the longitudinal scores yielded five subtypes of drug offenders characterized either by consistently elevated perceived-deterrence scores, consistently moderate scores, consistently low scores, increasing scores, or decreasing scores. The best outcomes were associated with consistently elevated scores, whereas the worst outcomes were associated with scores that declined over time as the participants became accustomed to the program. The clusters also differed in predicted directions on demographic variables. The correlational design does not permit inferences of causality; however, the results lend credence to perceived deterrence as a potential explanatory mechanism for the effects of drug courts.

TI  - Underused potentials for criminology: Applying the sociology of knowledge to terrorism
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
CP  - 57th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Criminology
AB  - Knowledge has for a long time been a central category in criminological thought, the etiological and reaction sides alike. On the etiological side, rational choice, neutralization techniques, the learning and unlearning of motivations, practices and codes, and, lately, efforts toward a cognitive criminology exemplify approaches that refer implicitly or explicitly to 'knowledge'. Yet, with the exception of George Herbert Mead's work, the sociology of knowledge has barely been explicitly used. This paper argues that the conscious consideration of the sociology of knowledge, including neo-Durkheimian, neo-Marxist, and neo-Weberian traditions, promises great benefit to criminological thought. Such consideration sheds light on the distribution across time and space of cognitive and normative tools that contribute to patterns of norm breaking behavior. A brief overview of the implicit use of 'knowledge' in criminological theory is followed by an elaboration of the potential benefits for criminology from incorporating leading traditions in the sociology of knowledge. The article concludes with an illustration for the case of terrorism as it rises simultaneously, but seeks distinct targets, across regions of the world.

TI  - Factors of Mass Casualty Terrorism
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - Several changes in terrorist tactics have occurred recently. First, terrorist attack targets have changed from hard to soft targets. Second, terrorists are actively using low-tech terrorism methods that they can choose easily. Finally, terrorist attacks are evolving into complex and simultaneous terrorist events. This study endeavored to determine whether these changes affected the number of casualties from terrorist events that occurred in developed countries. Based on the rational choice theory and situational crime prevention, the variables were constructed based on two dimensions: "target factors in terrorism" and "terrorist attack factors in terrorism." To achieve the purpose of this study, a negative binomial regression analysis was performed based on data from the Global Terrorism Database. Consequently, variables such as "exposure," "protection capability," "attack patterns (vehicle)," and "suicide terrorism" were verified for their statistically significant influence on "mass casualty terrorism (MCT)." This study suggests that it is necessary to design a preventive environment and arrange for personnel at each site that is vulnerable to terrorism to prevent MCT events from occurring inside facilities.

TI  - When failure is the option: Unravelling sexual assault outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - We investigate the concept of "criminal failure" in sexual crimes and the relevance of various theoretical frameworks for its understanding: individual offender's rational choice, environmental influences and routine activities, victimological characteristics from lifestyle theory, and crime interaction factors. We examined a sample of 1121 "failed" cases (i.e., attempted but not completed) and 1500 "successful" cases (i.e., completed) of sexual assault that occurred in France between 1990 and 2018. We used 32 predictors that mapped on the four theoretical frameworks and conducted bivariate followed by multivariate analyses. Multiple theoretical frameworks are relevant to understand criminal failure, which is a product of perpetrator, environmental, victimological, and interactional factors. Two distinct patterns are specifically associated with failure: lack of preparation and lack of social skills. In addition, failure was best understood not as a unitary concept, but as multifactorial by distinguishing between different types of failure, specifically: offender intentionally released the victim before completion, victim escaped or third party rescue. Finally, patterns of failure were different in sexual crimes against children compared to those against adults. Criminology should pay closer attention to failure in crime. This understudied area can yield important theoretical knowledge and practical implications regarding the prevention of sexual crimes.

TI  - Violence Against Civilians in the Second Intifada: The Moderating Effect of Armed Group Structure on Opportunistic Violence
T2  - COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES
AB  - Patterns of military violence against civilians vary considerably, between conflicts and within them. This article explores why some combatants are more likely than others to engage in violence against civilians, focusing on a particular subset of such violence, violence that is not planned or authorized by military superiors, termed opportunistic violence. In a sample of Israeli combat soldiers from the Second Intifada, opportunistic violence was found to be strongly associated with duration of deployment among civilians. Long deployments erode social and moral norms, raising the likelihood that combatants will act opportunistically. However, the relationship between deployment duration and opportunistic violence was moderated by unit structure, such that long deployments were more likely to cause opportunistic violence in units with weak command structures. These findings suggest that the deleterious effects of long deployments are not inevitable but can be limited to a large extent through well-functioning structures of command and discipline.

TI  - 'Two Sides of the Same Coin'-A Proposed Model for Delivering a Whole System Serial Crime Reduction Plan
T2  - POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This article describes how existing and newly emerged research can be combined to develop a more systematic model for responding to serial crimes. We believe that the model offers police services a more efficient and effective way to optimize the deployment and scheduling of police resources, and their associated activity, to combat serial offending. We suggest that the likely subsequent prevention and reduction of demand achieved will go some way to alleviate the impact of serial offending behavior. To develop our model, we draw upon criminological literature including theories of routine activity, rational choice, and situational crime prevention. By incorporating existing methods of hotspot identification, and combining these with processes to identify and respond to serial offending, we propose a six-stage, Dual Offender-Victim, Crime Prevention and Reduction model, that includes (1) crime linkage to identify serial offending; (2) near-repeat pattern analysis to identify the areas experiencing, and at immediate risk of victimization; (3) THE prediction of future, spatially displaced hotspots at high risk of victimization; (4) geographical profiling to identify the area of the likely home or base of the offender; (5) suspect mapping, ranking, targeting, and early intervention; and (6) tracking of spatial displacement, and offender management to maintain model effectiveness.

TI  - Super controllers and crime prevention: A routine activity explanation of crime prevention success and failure
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
CP  - 17th Annual Environmental Criminology and Crime Analysis Symposium
AB  - Why does crime prevention fail? And under what conditions does it succeed? Routine Activity Theory provides the foundation for understanding crime and its patterns by focusing on variations in the convergence of offenders, targets and controllers in space and time. But Routine Activity Theory does not provide a full understanding of why the controllers may be absent or ineffective. This article expands Routine Activity Theory to explain controllers. It claims that the behaviors of controllers can be understood in the context of their relationship with super controllers - those who regulate controllers' incentives to prevent crime. The article lists and describes types of super controllers. Drawing on a rational choice perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, the article examines the methods super controllers use to regulate the conduct of controllers. Examples are used throughout to illustrate specific points and to show the diversity of super controlling. This article concludes with a discussion of the implication of super controllers for the practice of crime prevention and research into crime reduction methods.

TI  - Enacting social engineering: the emotional experience of information security deception
T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Social engineering is a modern form of fraud that is widely implicated in contributing to information security breaches. This study situates social engineering in past criminological work on fraud and analyzes qualitative interviews with social engineers to elucidate the emotional experiences of perpetrating such frauds. The results of this analysis indicate that social engineering interactions are characterized by an emotional experience of situational tension and the subsequent resolution of that tension. The analysis then turns to factors that modulate the quality and intensity of the emotional experience of social engineering perpetration. These factors include the social distance between the social engineer and the mark, the social engineer's framing the mark, and both perceived and actual efficacy in utilizing skills involved in management of self and situation. This study suggests that the emotional experience of social engineering parallels that of other frauds and is revelatory of the motivations behind the experiences.

TI  - Addressing the 'Dirty Little Secret' of Deterrence: Testing the Effects of Increased Police Presence on Perceptions of Arrest Risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - ObjectivesTo examine the perceptual deterrent effect of an increase in police presence for a sample of previously adjudicated adolescents and address the limitations of existing perceptual deterrence research.MethodsThis study exploits the timing of Operation Safe Streets, a hot spots policing intervention designed to increase officer presence, which occurred during an ongoing longitudinal survey of previously adjudicated adolescents (n = 700). The effect of this intervention is tested using first-difference models of perceptions of arrest risk within-person over time. Sensitivity analyses and falsification tests are also conducted to provide further confidence in the findings.ResultsResults show that Operation Safe Streets is related to an increase in perceptions of arrest risk for one's self, as well as perceptions of other's arrest risk. This pattern holds for those who were and were not arrested. Furthermore, null findings for the effect of Operation Safe Streets on perceived social costs of punishment, as well as null findings from in-time placebo models, lend strong support that an increase in police officer presence did increase individuals' perceptions of arrest risk in the months following the intervention.ConclusionsThis study is the first to test the perceptual deterrent effect of a police intervention aimed to reduce street crime. It is also one of the first to demonstrate that criminal justice policies impact perceptions of arrest risk. This study adds to our understanding of the success of hot spots policing by suggesting that one pathway for decreased crime is through changes in perceptions of arrest risk.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY
AB  - Objectives: This article examines the decision-making of consumers of illegal goods and services, using the illegal cigarette market in the South Bronx as a case study.
   Methods: Sixty-seven adult smokers residing in the South Bronx (New York City) were purposively recruited and placed into 13 focus groups stratified by gender and age to discuss their purchasing patterns of cigarettes.
   Results: Our participants routinely buy and consume illicit cigarettes. They prefer to purchase these illicit cigarettes in legitimate stores rather than from street vendors. In their decision-making, our participants are guided by various concerns, including reliable access to illicit cigarettes, minimal exposure to the police, the ability to purchase cigarettes on credit, reduced risk of being sold low-quality cigarettes (i.e., stale, counterfeit), and the chance to successfully complain in case of poor product quality.
   Conclusions: Consumers make rational decisions to purchase illicit cigarettes within the constraints they face as a result of their socioeconomic position. They base their decisions on a set of factors of which the lowest retail price is not a primary concern.

TI  - Could social media reflect acquisitive crime patterns in London?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SAFETY SCIENCE AND RESILIENCE
AB  - Embraced within the framework of crime opportunities integrated with Social Disorganization theory and Broken Windows theory, this paper intends to explore the patterns of four types of acquisitive crimes, using social media data, i.e., Twitter, Foursquare and cross-sectional data acquired through text analysis technique. With Greater London as the study area, models like negative binominal regression (NBR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) are performed to illustrate the aggregated relationships between acquisitive crimes and crime opportunities at London-wide and sub-regional MSOAs levels respectively. The results work towards to hypotheses that: the tweets sentiment could reflect property-related crime rates positively in light of Broken Windows Theory; more tweets with negative sentiment may incur increases in acquisitive crimes. It contributed to existing studies in (1) providing empirical evidence for integrating these three theories; (2) complementing current research on local discrepancies of acquisitive crimes by utilising both GWR and NBR models; (3) challenging the traditional stereotypes about racial disparities with the finding that ethnic heterogeneity and instrumental crimes have counterintuitive association, especially taking education factor into consideration; (4) implicating some localised acquisitive crime prevention strategies to policy makers in light of the reality that the relationship between local variations and different crime types may vary by place.

TI  - The Psycho-criminology of Burial Sites: Developing the Winthropping Method for Locating Clandestine Burial Sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The majority of geographical profiling research focuses on the relationship between offender and location, which works particularly well when a burial site is known. In real-world investigations, however, burial or dump sites are often not known. The aim of the current paper is to outline a relatively under-used method of geographic profiling: Winthropping. While the method has been around for several decades, few studies have provided any research findings using it. There are two likely reasons for Winthropping being under-used: first, it has not been clearly, theoretically explained; second, given its relative novelty, it may not be immediately clear how to use it in research and real-world scenarios. The current paper outlines several key psychological (e.g., satisficing and affordances) and criminological (e.g., rational choice theory and crime geometry) theories that may explain why Winthropping works. Case studies are provided, and a methodological approach (matrix forecasting) is then provided to show how it could work in research practice and real-world applications. Overall, Winthropping is deemed to be highly useful, and it is hoped that experts in the field will begin developing this tool for wider, applied use.

TI  - Sexual crime and place: The impact of the environmental context on sexual assault outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Purpose: Using the rational choice perspective, the current study investigates the impact that the environment and offending behavior have on serial sexual crime event outcomes.
   Methods: The effects of time and place factors, as well as offender modus operandi strategies, on sexual crime event outcomes are tested using Generalized Estimating Equations on a sample of 361 crime events committed by 72 serial sex offenders.
   Results: Time and place do impact serial stranger sexual offenders' modus operandi strategies, but the place characteristics of the crime have more of an effect on the offender's behavior than do the temporal conditions during which the event occurs. Subsequent analyses indicate that temporal and place factors, as well as offender modus operandi strategies, predict whether the offender completes the rape, his reaction to victim resistance, and the level of physical force that he inflicts on the victim, but not whether the victim is forced to commit sexual acts on the offender.
   Conclusions: Serial stranger sexual offenders are effective decision-makers who adapt their strategies to the physical environment in which they commit their crimes, but their degree of rationality can vary as some outcomes are more dependent on the context than the offender and his actions.

In this study, we tested how advertisement characteristics affect the popularity of illicit online advertisements offering account credentials. Unlike previous criminological research, we take a novel approach by assessing the applicability of knowledge on regular consumer behaviours instead of theories explaining offender behaviour.MethodsWe scraped 1,565 unique advertisements offering credentials on a darkweb market. We used this panel data set to predict the simultaneous effects of the asking price, endorsement cues and title elements on advertisement popularity by estimating several hybrid panel data models.ResultsMost of our findings disconfirm our hypotheses. Asking price did not affect advertisement popularity. Endorsement cues, including vendor reputation and cumulative sales and views, had mixed and negative relationships, respectively, with advertisement popularity.DiscussionOur results might suggest that account credentials are not simply regular products, but high-risk commodities that, paradoxically, become less attractive as they gain popularity. This study highlights the necessity of a deeper understanding of illicit online market dynamics to improve theories on illicit consumer behaviours and assist cybersecurity experts in disrupting criminal business models more effectively. We propose several avenues for future experimental research to gain further insights into these illicit processes.

TI  - Analysis of the driving factors of US domestic population mobility
T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - There is a popular supposition that domestic population mobility in the United States has been steadily decreasing since the 1980s. However, some scholars believe the declining rate of American internal migration seems to have 'slowed down' obviously from 2007. This debate prompts us to quantitatively analyze the possible changes in migration patterns and the mechanisms of domestic population mobility. First, using empirical data of state-to-state migration, the paper quantifies American internal mobility and the evolution of migration patterns for the period from 2005-2015. Regional income disparities cannot explain the change in population migration patterns in the United States well. Then, the mobility barriers are estimated by an extended multilateral migration model that reveals a marked decrease in regional migration costs and an increase in individual rational choices, which are the critical factors in the structural changes in the migration pattern. Subsequently, we deconstruct the mobility barriers and indicate that in recent years, the human and natural environments had a great impact on population movement in the United States, such as the human development index, education grade, climate, cost of living index, house price index, and crime rate.

TI  - Crime prevention of bus pickpocketing in Beijing, China: does air quality affect crime?
T2  - SECURITY JOURNAL
AB  - In recent years, along with the development of the urban public transport system, bus pickpocketing crimes have garnered increasing attention. In this paper, a complete and clear structure including finding patterns based on data, applying criminological theory to explain patterns, and using empirical investigation method to verify theoretical explanation are presented. We found that temperature and season are not clearly correlated with bus pickpocketing. The AQI and PM2.5 indices, however, demonstrated significant correlations with daily bus pickpocketing incidents: the worse the air quality, the more bus pickpocketing occurred. Then two empirical investigations were carried out to verified that crime pattern theory and rational choice theory can be used to explain the impact of air quality on bus pickpocketing crime. Furthermore, we utilized the SVM method to predict daily bus pickpocketing crime risk with an accuracy rate of 81%. The results of this paper can provide early warnings of urban bus pickpocketing and help police reduce crimes.

TI  - Diversity in organised crime
T2  - REVIJA ZA KRIMINALISTIKO IN KRIMINOLOGIJO
AB  - Authors dealing with organised crime have in recent times usually stressed a similarity between the activities of organised criminal associations and the operation of legal companies, and highlight their rationality. Given a choice between legal and illegal activities, illegal entrepreneurs make a selective rational choice, based on a calculation of what is better for them and for their companies, claim advocates of the theory of criminal enterprise. Their choices and patterns - as in companies which function within the law - follow the general economic principle of making a profit on profitable markets. Authors therefore focus on the organisation of criminal activity and on the illegal market dynamics and not on the individuals involved in these activities. With an understanding of organised criminal associations as criminal enterprises, these author deviate from Gottfredson's and Hirschi's idea, according to which individuals involved in organised crime typically have a low degree of self-control, i.e., are impulsive; short-sighted and oriented to the present moment, inclined to the instant satisfaction of desires and unwilling to work for remote aims. Are individuals and the activity of members of criminal groups, which are needed for organised crime really so uniform? An analysis of the literature, the carrying out of an (ethnographic) research project in the field of organised crime and interviews conducted for this purpose confirm that criminal offenders do not exist in a social and physical world which is different from other parts of society. Since organised crime is a part of the diversity of the everyday world, due to its nature it attracts or needs a very diverse group of activities and people.

TI  - Assessing the effects of bus stop relocation on street robbery
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - A number of studies have revealed a correlation between bus stops and crimes, especially street robberies. However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement.

TI  - Street Light Outages, Public Safety and Crime Attraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives For more than one hundred years, street lighting has been one of the most ubiquitous capital investments in public safety. Prior research on street lighting is largely limited to ecological studies of very small geographic areas, creating substantial challenges with respect to both causal identification and statistical power. We address limitations of the prior literature by studying a natural experiment created by short-term disruptions to municipal street lighting. Methods We leverage a natural experiment created by the differential timing of the repair of nearly 300,000 street light outages in Chicago. By conditioning on street segment fixed effects and focusing on a short window of time around the repair of a street light outage, we can credibly rule out confounding factors due to area-specific time trends as well as street segment-level correlates of crime. Results We find that outdoor nighttime crimes change very little on street segments affected by street light outages, but that outages cause crime to spill over to nearby street segments. Effects are largest for robberies and motor vehicle theft. Conclusions Despite strong environmental and social characteristics that tend to tie crime to place, we observe that street light outages are sufficiently salient to disrupt longstanding patterns. While the impact of localized street light outages can reverberate throughout a community, the findings imply that improvements in lighting can be defeated by the displacement of crime to adjacent spaces and therefore do not necessarily suggest that localized investments in municipal street lighting will yield a large public safety dividend.

TI  - Geocoding child sexual abuse: An explorative analysis on journey to crime and to victimization from French police data
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB  - Background: For several years, the link between mobility, human behavior and crime have highlighted by criminologists. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty of compiling sensitive geo-graphical data, the spatial behavior of extrafamilial child abusers has received little empirical attention.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial mobility of victims and offenders of extrafamilial child abuse under the lens of the crime mobility triangle methodology. The main objective is to analyze the distribution of the spatial mobility patterns and determine which factors are associated with these patterns.
   Participants: This study analyses the characteristics of 612 cases of extrafamilial child abuses recorded by the French police between 1979 and 2013.
   Methods: By using police data, this research analyses firstly the journey to crime and the victims of child abuse with descriptive analyses. Secondly, geographical data are merged to compute and classify the cases in the geometric and geographic mobility typologies. Thirdly, multivariate analyses are used to identify which factors are associated with each specific mobility pattern.
   Results: Results suggest that the journeys to crime and victimization are shorter compared to cases of adult sexual abuse. Over 50% of aggression occurred within 2.5 km of offenders' houses and 0.5 km of victims' residences. Acquaintanceship is more important when the victims are younger while the expansion of routine activities associated with secondary socialization increases the risk of aggression in public spaces.
   Conclusions: Journeys to crime are affected by children routine activities and modus operandi parameters, whereas offenders' characteristics were found to have no impact on the spatial behavior.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between income inequality and crime in Toronto using frequentist and Bayesian models: Examining different crime types and spatial scales
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
AB  - Income inequality, which refers to the uneven distribution of income in a population, has been linked to many societal problems, including crime. Although environmental criminology theories, such as rational choice theory, suggest a positive association between income inequality and crime, previous empirical studies have reported divergent results based on different crime types, statistical models, and spatial units of analysis. This study employs non-spatial and spatial regression models using frequentist and Bayesian modelling frameworks to explore the impacts of within-area and across-area income inequality on five types of major crimes in the City of Toronto at the census tract and dissemination area scales. The use of spatial regression models improves the model fit in both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The Bayesian shared component model, which accounts for the interactions between different types of crimes, further enhances model performance. Results obtained from the best-fitting frequentist and Bayesian models are inconsistent but do not conflict in terms of the relationship between crime and income inequality, where within-area income inequality generally increases major crime rates, while across-area income inequality has varying effects dependent on crime type and spatial scale. The discrepancies between spatial scales are a manifestation of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP).

TI  - Predictive policing in hospitality and tourism venues - The case of Orlando
T2  - JOURNAL OF DESTINATION MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public.

TI  - The Impact of Online and Offline Information Sources on Automobile Choice Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB  - The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Simulating Spatial-Temporal Pulse Events in Criminal Site Selection Problems
T2  - AGENT-DIRECTED SIMULATION SYMPOSIUM 2012 (ADS 2012)
CP  - Agent-Directed Simulation Symposium (ADS 2012)
AB  - Previous academic research has identified the correlation between special events and crime rates within cities. However, in much of the previous work, the focus was either on spatial or temporal analysis related to the evolution of local crime patterns in conjunction with the special events. This research uses a hybrid agent-based simulation to examine the impact of temporal pulse events on the criminal site selection process. The simulation provides researchers with a method for adjusting both the temporal and spatial patterns in response to a series of a-priori cultural events. Using the data from this simulation, we illustrate the effectiveness of a new modeling approach. Initial results show that adding a hierarchical framework to a generalized linear model improves crime prediction accuracy and offers the law enforcement analyst better insight into both the temporal and spatial considerations of criminals. Improving the ability of law enforcement to identify, and prepare for, spatial-temporal shifts in crime patterns will significantly enhance proactive policing operations and resource allocation planning in support of large special events.

TI  - Police leniency in traffic enforcement encounters: Exploratory findings from observations and interviews
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
AB  - Despite the volume of time officers spend on traffic enforcement encounters, there was limited research exploring how they used their discretion in such interactions. Issues relating to police decision making patterns in the enforcement of motor vehicle laws were particularly salient in light of the on-going debate over racial profiling. This study examined how officers made decisions (in particular, to stop and to sanction) in the course of traffic enforcement. Using field observations and interviews with officers in a small midwestern agency, the authors described the factors and forces that officers used in making discretionary choices. The findings indicated that leniency in sanctioning was very common and that officers expected citizens to be contrite and acknowledge responsibility for their infractions. Implications for larger and more systematic observational studies are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
